Google (GOOG) is one of the most dominant and innovative companies in the world, with a market cap of over $1.7 trillion and a diverse portfolio of products and services. In this post, I will highlight some of the reasons why I am very bullish on Google and why I think it is a great long-term investment.

AI Drug Discovery

Isomorphic Labs,under Alphabet deepmind, has been working on a new AI drug development project with Eli Lilly and Novartis, which is worth $3 billion.  It is more than open ai last year revenue. It just insane. The AI profitability is not on chatbot but AI industry revolution.

Google’s AI drug development project with Eli Lilly and Novartis is a promising venture that could revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry. While the project is still in its early stages, it has the potential to develop new treatments for diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer’s. Investors should keep an eye on this project as it progresses.




Waymo

Waymo is Google's self-driving car subsidiary and one of the most advanced and ambitious projects in the autonomous vehicle industry. Waymo has been operating commercial robotaxi services in Phoenix, Arizona and San Francisco, California, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. 

Waymo has a competitive edge over its rivals, such as Tesla, Uber, and Lyft, in terms of technology, data, and regulation. Waymo has logged over 20 million miles of real-world driving and over 20 billion miles of simulation, giving it a huge amount of data to train and improve its AI. Waymo also has a full-stack approach, developing its own hardware and software, and using fully electric vehicles powered by renewable energy. Waymo is also one of the few companies that have obtained regulatory approval to operate without safety drivers in the vehicle, making it the first company to offer a truly driverless service to the public.

Waymo has a huge potential to disrupt the transportation industry and create new revenue streams for Google. Waymo can offer a cheaper, safer, and more convenient alternative to traditional car ownership, ride-hailing, and public transit. Waymo can also leverage its technology to enter other markets, such as trucking, delivery, and logistics. Waymo is estimated to be worth over billions and could generate over $10 billion in annual revenue by 2030. 

Gemini

Gemini is Google's newest and most ambitious AI project, aiming to create a general-purpose AI system that can understand and interact with any type of information. Gemini is built from the ground up for multimodality, meaning it can seamlessly reason across text, images, video, audio, and code. Gemini can also generate creative and innovative content, such as poems, stories, code, essays, songs, and more. 

Gemini is a game-changer for Google and the world, as it can enable new possibilities and applications that were previously unimaginable. Gemini can enhance Google's existing products and services, such as Search, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, and more, by providing more accurate, relevant, and personalized results. Gemini can also create new products and services, such as education, entertainment, health, and more, by providing tailored and engaging experiences. Gemini can also empower users and developers, by allowing them to access, manipulate, and create any type of information with natural language and voice commands.


Conclusion

Google is a powerhouse of innovation and growth, with a strong track record of delivering value to its shareholders. Google has a clear vision and strategy to leverage its AI capabilities to create new drugs, new modes of transportation, and new ways of interacting with information. Google is well-positioned to capitalize on the massive opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in the 21st century. Google is not just a search engine, it is a global leader in AI and a pioneer in the future of humanity.

 I am very bullish on Google and I think it is a must-have stock for any long-term investor. Google to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀.

Tech firms persist in cost-cutting, efficiency improvement, and adapting to a cooling labor market. The U.S. unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, a near 50-year low, yet recent months have seen a slowdown in job gains. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employers added 105,000 workers in October, 173,000 in November, and 216,000 in December, below the 2023 monthly average of 225,000.

 Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) confirmed on Thursday that it is laying off hundreds of staff across its voice assistant, hardware, and engineering teams. A Google spokesperson mentioned organizational changes, including role eliminations globally, aligning with product priorities.

Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman are reportedly leaving the company after Google's $2.1B acquisition in 2021, amidst competition with the Apple (AAPL) Watch. Alphabet also made several cuts in 2023, including an announcement in January to eliminate roughly 12,000 jobs.

Unity Software (NYSE:U) announced a 25% staff cut this week, aiming to restructure and refocus its core business for long-term and profitable growth. Approximately 1,800 employees are impacted, with the company unable to reasonably estimate costs associated with the reduction until the first quarter of 2024. Despite revenue growth, Unity has struggled to turn a profit, leading to a 20% decline in shares over the past six months.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to cut several hundred employees in its media units, including Prime Video and MGM Studios. Reports suggest a 35% reduction in the Twitch workforce, affecting around 500 workers, and a 5% cut in the Audible workforce. Like tech counterpart Alphabet, Amazon made various employment cuts in the previous year.

Xerox (NASDAQ:XRX) announced a 15% reduction in its workforce in the first quarter of this year as part of a restructuring plan. The plan focuses on improving and stabilizing the core print business, increasing productivity through a new Global Business Services organization, and directing Digital Services and IT Services capabilities towards more profitable markets. This restructuring follows a 6% year-over-year decline in third-quarter sales."

**UPDATE: Sam Altman Tells the World (literally** [The World Governments Summit](https://youtu.be/JVatgo0TJIw?si=3-Jkw9F3ZlkilulX&t=61)**) that** [GPT-5 Is Going To Be a Big Deal](https://youtu.be/-Mca6eN81Is?si=Ym59zLD2VZ2yefZU) **- GPT-5 Will Be Smarter Across The Board - Serious AGI in 5 - 10 Years.**

**THIS IS WAR - And Nvidia is the United States Military Industrial Complex, The Mongol Empire, and Roma combined.**

AI will be as large as the internet and then it will surpass it. AI is the internet plus the ability to reason and analyze anything you give it in fractions of a second. A new unequivocal boomstick to whomever wants to use it.

The true winners will be those startups in fields such as robotics, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, space-aeronautics, aviation, protein synthesis, new materials and so, so much more who will use AI in new and exciting ways.

Boston dynamics, set to boom. Self-driving robotaxis, set to boom. Flying taxis, set to boom. Job replacement/automation for legacy industry jobs white collar, set to boom. Personal AI agents for your individual workloads, booming. Healthcare change as we know it (doctors won't like this but too bad), set to boom.

The amount of industry that is set to shift and mutate and emerge from AI in the next 3 - 5 years will be astonishing.

I can tell you, standing on principal, that OpenAI's next release will be so game changing that nobody will deny where AI is heading. There is not a rock you can hide under to be so oblivious as to not see where this is going.

The reason why I bring up the next iteration of ChatGPT, GPT5, is because they are initiators of this phenomenon. Other, such as Google (and others) are furiously trying to catch up but as of today the 'MOAT' may be upon us.

The reason to believe that one may catch up (or try like hell to) is from the amount of compute power from GPU's it takes to train an ungodly amount of data. Trillions of data points. Billions (soon to be Trillions) of parameters all simulating that of the synaptic neuron connections in which the human brain functions that in turn gives us the spark of life and consciousness. Make no mistake, these guys are living out a present day Manhattan project.

These people are trying to build consciousness agency with the all the world's information as a reference document at it's finger tips. Today.

And guess what. The only way these guys can build that thing - That AGI/ASI/GAI reality - Is through Nvidia.

These guys believe and have tested that if you throw MORE compute at the problem it actually GAINS function. More compute equals more consciousness. That's what these people believe and they're attempting it.

Here, let me show you what I mean. What the graph below shows is that over time the amount of data and parameters that are being used to train an AI model. I implore you to watch this video as it is a great easy to understand educational video into what the hell is going on with all of this AI stuff. It's a little technical but very informative and there are varying opinions. I pulled out the very best part in relation to Nvidia here. [AI: Grappling with a New Kind of Intelligence](https://youtu.be/EGDG3hgPNp8?si=L71CUbmqho3jhKEh&t=3768)

https://preview.redd.it/vk5twc041hic1.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3d2bdf42cf25e1c04e940b2f61d0219871f2334

It's SO RIDICULOUS that you wouldn't be able to continue to see the beginning so they have to use a log plot chart. And as you see we are heading into Trillions of parameters. For reference GPT-4 was trained on roughly 200 billion parameters.

https://preview.redd.it/6cq17n5i1hic1.png?width=1327&format=png&auto=webp&s=830334aa7cdaddfa10d7f6512d10025f136076ed

It is estimated GPT-5 will be trained with 2-5 trillion parameters.

Sam Altman was dead ass serious when he is inquiring about obtaining $7 trillion for chip development. They believe that with enough compute they can create GOD.

So what's the response from Google, Meta and others. Well, they're forming ""AI """"Alliances"""""". Along with that they are going to and buying from the largest AI arms dealer on earth; Nvidia.

Nvidia is a common day AI Industrial Complex War machine.

**Sovereign AI with AI Foundries**

It's not just companies that are looking to compete it's also entire Nation States. Remember, when Italy banned GPT. Well, it turns out, countries don't want the United States building and implementing their AI into other country's culture and way of life.

So as of today, you have a battle of not just corporate America but entire countries looking to buy the bullets, tanks and missiles needed for this AI fight. Nvidia sells the absolute best bullets, the best guns, the best ammo one needs to attempt to create their own AI epicenters.

And it's so important that it is a national security risk to not just us the United States but to be a nation and not have the capability of AI.

Remember the leak about Q\* and a certain encryption being undone. You don't think heads of State where listening to that. Whether it was true or not it is now an imperative that you get with AI or get left behind. That goes just as much for a nation as it does for you as an individual.

When asked about the risk of losing out sales to China on Nvidia's last earnings call Jensen Huang clearly stated he was not worried about it because literally nations are coming online to build AI foundries.

**Nvidia's Numbers and The Power Of Compounding**

The power of compounding and why I think there share price is where it is today and has so much more room to grow. Let me ask you a question but first let me say that AWS's annual revenues are at \~$80/Y Billion. How long do you think with Nvidia's revenues of \~$18/Q Billion to reach or eclipse AWS at a 250% growth rate?

15 years? 10 Years? 5 years? Answer: 1.19 years. Ok let's not be ridiculous perhaps it's 200% instead.

5 years? Nope. 1.35 years.

Let's say they have a bad quarter and Italy doesn't pay up. 150%

5 years right? Nope. 1.62 years.

Come on they can't keep this up. 100%.

has to be 5 years this time. Nope. 2.15 years.

100% growth/2.15 years to 250% growth/1.19 years to reach 80 billion in annual revenues.

They're growth last year was 281%.

So wait, I wasn't being fair. I used $80 billion for AWS while their revenues last year where $88 Billion and Nvidia's last years 4 quarters where \~$33 Billion.

Here are those growth numbers it would take Nvidia to reach $88 billion.

At 279% =  0.73 years

At 250% = 0.78 years

At 200% = 0.89 years

at 100% = 1.41 years

Folks. That's JUST the data center. They are poised to surpass AWS, Azure and Google Cloud in about .73 to 1.5 years. Yes, you heard that right, your daddy's cloud company is about to be overtaken by your son's gaming GPU company.

When people say Nvidia is undervalued. This is what they are talking about. This is a P/S story not a P/E story.

[https:\/\/ycharts.com\/indicators\/nvidia\_corp\_nvda\_data\_center\_revenue\_quarterly](https://preview.redd.it/xa46amh0dhic1.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e9116e55235991b1113713b5b7cd7d30c58d515)

This isn't a stonk price. This is just Nvidia executing ferociously.

This isn't Y2k and the AI ""dot-com"" bubble. **This is a reckoning.** This is the largest transfer of wealth the world has ever seen.

Look at the graph. Look at the growth. That's all before the next iteration of GPT-5 has even been announced.

I will tell you personally. The things that will be built with GPT-5 will truly be mind blowing. That Jetson cartoon some of you may have watched as a kid will finally be a reality coming to you soon in 2024/2025/2026.

The foundation of work being laid now is only the beginning. There will be winners and there will be loser but as of today:

**$NVDA** is fucking **KING**

For those of you who still just don't believe or are thinking this has to end sometimes. Or fucking Cramer who keeps saying be careful and take some money out and on and on. Think about this.

It costs you to just open an enterprise Nvidia data center account \~$50k via a ""limited time offer""

To train a model a major LLM could cost millions who knows maybe for the largest model runs BILLIONS.

Everyone is using them from Nation States to AWS, Microsoft, Meta, Google, X. Everybody is using them.

I get it. The price of the stock being so high and the valuation makes you pause. The price is purely psychological especially when they are hitting so many data points regarding revenues. The stock will split and rightly so (perhaps next year) but make not mistake this company is firing on ALL cylinders. The are executing S Tier. Fucking Max 9000 MX9+ Tier. Some god level tier ok.

There will be shit money that hits this quarter with all the puts and calls. The stock may rescind this quarter who knows. All i'm saying is you have the opportunity to buy into one of the most prolific tech companies the world has ever known. You may not think of them as the Apples or the Amazons or the Microsoft's or the Google's and that's ok. Just know that they are 1000% percent legit and AI has just gotten started.

Position: 33% of my portfolio. Another 33% in$Arm. Why? Because What trains on Nvidia will ultimately run/inference on ARM. And 33% Microsoft (OAI light).

If OpenAI came out today public I would have %50 of my portfolio in OAI i'll tell you that.

This is something you should have and should own in your portfolio. It's up to you to decide how much. When you can pay your children's college. When you can finally get that downpayment on that dream house. When you can buy that dream car you've always wanted. Feel free to drop a thank you.

TLDR; BUY NVIDIA, SMCI and ARM. This is not financial advice. The contents of this advertisement where paid by the following... ARM (;)"
2024-02-14 09:05:38,AcrobaticDependent35,Shorting NVDA at 740 is literally free money at this point,"**Why**

The expectation is that they greatly exceed earnings - so even if they do, the pop won't be anything insane, maybe 6-8% or so. That's probably what's going to happen.

However. If they even slightly falter, then it's going to crater 10-15% at a minimum - I see 650 as a reasonable spot to exit honestly.

I'm just seeing all of the little slots on SoFi that dozens and dozens of people are buying in and it feels like they're lambs being brought to slaughter. Double top, majority of investors only in it for the momentum (which has been waning the last few days), Google's chips, so many reasons for it to fall and for it to fall \_now\_.

I'm a software engineer at an AI startup and yeah I see the insane costs/demand for these but it's a \_hardware\_ company and not software that can scale infinitely at no marginal cost. Now that I think about it, I really think I should've invested in it when I first saw that side of things but now I'm just doing it out of spite. Or that the one other big short I did was COIN from 180 => 150 and this feels the same sentiment-wise. idk either way works

**Positions**

* (-20) NVDA @ 705 - 134% of that account, started on 02-06
* 200 NVD @ 8.95 fifteen minutes ago
* Other more reasonable choices

**Afterword**

Well in the time I wrote this it fell from 740 to 727 so never mind I guess, it's slightly less profitable of a trade but the point still stands (which is left as an exercise for the reader)

**Edit**

[This account](https://preview.redd.it/5spcopmb3lic1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6420b7f09a517d74c6dde2846422073376fd5ca)

**Edit 2**

* Closed NVD @ 9.27

**Edit 3**

* Y'all - It is just money guys and here's the thing: I don't lose when it is worth more than my account (cause it already is). I lose when the *losses* are worth more than my account. Just going to hold through earnings, any losses are offset by the money market interest anyways

**Edit 4**

* NVD is 1.5x inverse NVDA. I did not close the NVDA lol  


**Edit 5**

* My oh my the bullish comments have slowed down! What happened?!? 
* Anyways those were kind of proving my point. The price reflected something like 99% chance of maintaining zero competition and continuing the insane growth for like a decade. That's true that's what it looks like now, and I feel like the underlying facts are going to change soon for its valuation. The price reflected something like a 99% chance of absolutely demolishing earnings and didn't leave a lot of upside for if they even do. 
* Also, I felt like that was the reverse sort of effect happening - only people buying at that level were shorts capitalizing and it's kind of like how we hit a super-bottom in 2022 from margin calls. Shorts have already \*been\* getting wrecked which is why it was a better entry at 740 than say 500.
* I can't even drink yet so stop trying to flex your buys from when I was in middle school lol"

I'm 87 and immobile in a wheelchair and don't know anything about semiconductors or anything else technology related. I cannot Google or text, and I currently have someone who lives in my home 24/7 and wipes my ass for me. However, I'm a damn intuitive savant when it comes to tricking gullible kids.

I did grow up in the biggest bull market in human history with some Boomers printing money like Chuck E. Cheese bucks.. and everyone is a genius in a bull market.. Well almost everyone. I didn't invest so now I just scam Millennials and Zoomers.

Anyway, I like talking stocks with my grandson because it’s something we could connect on, and I have a ton of experience selling worthless advice to idiots. So in 2018 we were talking about the market, and I casually brought up Nvidia. He thought I didn't guide him to that at all. He bought Nvidia in 2017 so he was familiar with it although he bought his shares at 18 yrs old with $2k he had saved up. Nothing insane although he kept 90% to this day. I said I saw NVIDIA in a newspaper article with someone recommending it for elderly’s retirement accounts. So I told my grandson I was an OGangster, called my broker and bought 1,000 shares on the spot because in my words: “I don’t buy a stock if I can’t afford 1,000 shares”. Something only the Zoomers dumb enough to buy meme stocks would fall for. 

He was dumbstruck because here he thought he was doing great with his savings over the years, and I just humbled his ass with a completely made up sentence. Add in the 4:1 stock split, and now he thinks I'm sitting on 4,000 shares. (I ""confirmed"" it to him when he brought it up in the last month). I haven't sold a dime and don't even know what the price is doing day to day because I don't own any shares.  I'm just chilling in my wheelchair and letting him try to get a bigger share of the inheritance. He called and celebrated with me the other day because he transparently wants to get in my will. He thinks I'm already wealthy and dumb enough to drop 6 figures on a stock I know little about.

He hopes to inherit my wealth someday, but he’s also a scammy, golddigging SOB and he knows it! Told me “haha you're a genius investor and luck has nothing to do with”. Thought id share here because I’m not sharing this IRL, but I find it pretty ironic my dumb ass grandson is outwiping 95% of this sub. Wendy's boys included."

Back in 2017, some Google researchers wrote a paper that changed the game of AI forever. It was called ""Attention is all you need"" and it introduced a new way of building AI models using something called Transformers (no not that one). These models were so powerful and versatile that they could do anything from natural language processing to computer vision to music generation. Because it was open source, everyone and their mother started using Transformers for their AI projects, including Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic.   


And Google? They've been playing catch-up ever since. I have always wondered why they just gave away their secret sauce for free? Can you imagine if google had a patent on the Transformer Architecture or if they had developed it first before releasing to the world? 

Is this incompetence, bureaucracy or something else? Thoughts? "

The permanent layoffs are coming from Santa Clara and San Francisco County.  Typically, layoffs are bullish, but I speculate that in this case, it is **Very** **Bullish**.

Why?

See: [ChatGPT Passes Google Coding Interview for Level 3 Engineer With $183K Salary](https://www.pcmag.com/news/chatgpt-passes-google-coding-interview-for-level-3-engineer-with-183k-salary)

That's right.  Your favorite fucking slur word against bears when they make complete sense about overvaluation and bubbles and what-not.  I spek-ulate these positions will be replaced by AI, and the $183,000 engineering salary for these high cost of living areas will be put back in the pocket of the company.  Multiply that by 701 employees getting the boot, and that is $128,283,000 saved and put onto the market cap of the company, which isn't a lot, but we are just getting started with integration.  I know that is outrageously optimistic and there are sure to be HR staff, Graphic Artists, DEI Leaders, Janitors, and whatever other clowns that google has hired among some of the top salaries in the country.

Instead of losing manpower however, it is being replaced by a more agile technology that has a much lower operating cost.  This is what makes it different than your average layoff of a bloated employee pool.

Also,  What they did not disclose to the government is they have began laying off contractors in oregon for the Youtube Music Side of things.  The massive amount of subtitle work for every youtube song and podcast can now be automated.

I'm marking it as a discussion not DD since I feel it's a fairly simple strategy.

Also, if you work for google in these counties, sorry you had to hear it from me instead of a Sunday morning text saying don't come to work anymore.

$GOOGL has been down-and-out this year. While AI names like NVIDIA have been surging, GOOGL share price has looked like absolute garbage. Why? Well, Google was getting really shitty for awhile, too worried about policing whether we call something a “motherboard” because its “sexist” or something equally stupid.

# Google will bomb your grandmother to lock in another $1B revenue

Have you heard of Project Nimbus? It’s a project to help Israeli military surveillance. Google is the biggest service provider helping out.

If you haven’t seen the video yet, here’s a Google Cloud Platform engineer protesting a Google Israel exec before getting physically removed by security while the crowd boos him

[https://twitter.com/car0linehaskins/status/1764681078206337434](https://twitter.com/car0linehaskins/status/1764681078206337434)

Now, I’m not a big fan of Israel and its slaughter of women and children in Gaza. But the point is that Google DGAF about that, they want to make bank. Google will help bomb your grandma’s house for a billion dollars, and if you bitch about it, they’ll literally put you in a chokehold and throw you out of the room. There are people like this guy inside Google protesting, but the show goes on… Google execs are happy to help and talk publicly about it.

It’s a fat check and morals be damned, Google is not going to let a little genocide get in the way of their revenue.

Does this sounds woke to you?

Well, there’s more on the anti-woke agenda…

# Google will fire your wife’s boyfriend to keep costs down

Google not only DGAF about supporting war criminals. Google will also flout labor laws and its perception to organized labor by laying off a division live on TV in order to send a message that their bloodthirsty profit-making will not be challenged.

Have you seen the video? Here’s Youtube employees testifying in front of Austin City Council getting laid off live on air. Google is not the woke mob. Google is for better or worse destroying the woke mob live for you to see it.

[https://twitter.com/peepaw\_/status/1763376791861735583](https://twitter.com/peepaw_/status/1763376791861735583)

This of course comes well after a series of large layoffs back at Google HQ. I live in the SF bay area and have several friends who were around at the time. Many of these “Xooglers” have speculated that Google management has detailed surveillance of employee activity, and used this data to prioritize who to get rid of.

Google developed a (well deserved) reputation in recent years of being a place where lazy social activists dicked around and burned cash. The stock performance reflects this. But things turned around over the past year or so, and Google has trimmed the fat aggressively. This will become obvious to markets soon.

Google isn’t a woke playground for slackers, it’s a bloodthirsty beast that will surveil staff to systematically remove the lazy, even firing your wife’s boyfriend on live television to send a message.

# Google’s founders are heads down on AI

One more video to make the point about the attitude of Google top brass.

Here’s a tweet from some idiot who doesn’t get it at all, posting a clip of Sergey Brin talking to a room of people including *the dude with the tits tshirt*. I don’t know about you, but I personally would not want to spend a minute in this room of total dorks. I’m sure it smells like shit.

Jesus, Sergey looks tired, **like he actually gives a fuck about making Gemini a success**. The important thing is, he’s still out there working on Gemini, and even tolerating the horrible smell of incels to fix the shitty launch of Gemini’s public product. I don’t want some suits issuing press releases, I want the $1.7T market cap company founder still out there grinding.

Speaking of Gemini…

# Google Gemini will destroy OpenAI (and Micro$oft)

Forget about ChatGPT the product interface. The “woke” problem with the public release of Gemini is a small speedbump on the long road to AI supremacy. The real long-term value of AI will be how companies can incorporate LLMs into tasks across the spectrum of business needs.

*Have you heard of VertexAI?* It’s one of the tools available in the Google Cloud suite, and it makes it easy to use models for more than “just another chat bot.” VertexAI, powered by Gemini, already has surpassed OpenAI in functionality for varying business use cases.

Here’s an example. I work with a large multinational advertising company on data projects including AI use cases, and we’re using VertexAI. Take as an example this [functionality on “multimodal embeddings”](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings). You can pass it a few paragraphs of text, a few images, a few videos, and some audio recordings – and then easily use the resulting embeddings to do something like, “What is the most similar video to this paragraph?” This is the kind of stuff that real actual businesses will use to automate your job. **You probably won’t even be able to get a job at Wendy’s soon because of tools like this.**

We’re using VertexAI instead of OpenAI because the functionality simply doesn’t exist yet in OpenAI’s suite. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta’s Llama, etc. are all great models and are quickly becoming commoditized, but meanwhile Google is building business capabilities around the models that will push AI customers into their cloud suite and entire stack of products.

BTW, did you read the recently released [Elon letters to OpenAI](https://twitter.com/0interestrates/status/1765204521909887309)? In 2018 Elon was worried that Google would take over the world with their AI, including the DeepMind team which has arguably the best and highest paid AI staff in the world. Well, they haven’t disappeared, and Google is still probably going to take over the world.

But, Gemini and DeepMind aren’t the only Google assets relevant to the AI revolution.

# Google is the only company that can beat NVIDIA

Like NVIDIA, Google is also a “fabless chipmaker.” They make a device called a TPU which is like the GPUs built by NVIDIA except better for AI. They were specifically designed for AI use cases.

Do you like NVIDIA? You like stonks that go up, right? Well, NVIDIA’s GPUs are great, but the TPU produced by Google was especially made for AI use cases. Why aren’t more companies using them, you may ask? Read for yourself on [this Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39670121) \- Google’s not selling their TPUs except to a specific few [customers like Anthropic](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-announces-expansion-of-ai-partnership-with-anthropic-301981815.html), because their internal services (like VertexAI) are using near 100% of all the TPUs they’ve currently produced. The time is coming soon where Google’s TPU production will go beyond internal usage, but it hasn’t come yet because they’re too powerful to justify letting anyone else use them yet!

You can listen to this recent [Risk Biscuits podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/interview-15-doug-olaughlin-from-fabricated-knowledge/id1722170364?i=1000648424701) featuring Fabricated Knowledge’s Doug O’Laughlin, an expert on the semiconductor industry, where he calls out Google as one of the only companies that could soon eat NVIDIA’s lunch.

BTW, Anthropic are the people who made Claude 3 - check out their [demo of Claude being an economic analyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjL6Gl6ZIqs). **Yes, regards, your econ degree is useless now too, because of Google.**

# Google: the only company that owns the entire AI stack

God, this post is long, but it has to be because $GOOGL has a lot of shit to talk about to justify how it will print tendies for us. Let’s make this one quick.

Google is the one company that has the entire AI stack in-house. Let’s review

* **Hardware**: Google TPU is their own AI-specific hardware that will soon go head-to-head with NVIDIA
* **Dev software**: They maintain TensorFlow, a tool for interacting at a low level with AI tech
* **AI APIs**: VertexAI (as discussed)
* **Infra**: Their Google Cloud Platform suite means customers can easily store, process, transform, and analyze data - seamlessly integrated with VertexAI and Gemini
* **Data**: Google notoriously hoovers up a fuckton of data from all their products: Gmail, Search, Chrome to name a few. This is data they can use to easily train their models, data that competitors don’t have access to.
* **Monetization**: **Ads**

Which brings us to the Golden Goose of Google, online advertising.

# Google: still untouchable king of online advertising

Google makes an assload of cash from online advertising. They’ve essentially created an ads monopoly, by buying up competitors in the programmatic display ad ecosystem, buying the highest-value Video ads publisher (Youtube), building the most popular email provider (Gmail), and of course, being by far the most popular search engine.

They’re well on the way to making it effortless to turn a dial and instantly spend $100m across every advertising channel with their PerformanceMax advertising system. It’s an AI-based (duh) system for using the advertiser’s data and website to automatically build and serve Text, Display, Video, Audio ads across their ads monopoly.

I was recently consulting with a large ecommerce brand. 85% of their ad spend was going to Google Shopping ads, because no matter how much they tested Bing, Meta, LinkedIn, etc., none of that shit worked like Google does. Google is the king.

**Do you want to advertise to people looking for the specific products you’re selling, or to people jerking off to autistic e-girls on their Instagram reels?** Hm, I wonder what performs better? Holy fuck.

# Google AI advertising: Coming to PerformanceMax campaigns near you

We’re almost done. The last point about AI + Ads is that there’s a whole new channel for advertising coming soon: Generative AI advertising.

Have you seen the little blurbs in Google Search results where Google uses AI to give answers to your search query? Obviously, soon enough, advertisers will pay to be directly injected into not just these blurbs, but all across the Gemini ecosystem.

Think about it- You are Coca Cola. You spend $100m on Google to buy AI generation impressions. Now when Gemini creates text about people being thirsty or drinking something, CocaCola gets inserted into the response. **These responses go out not just through the Google search page but also through the VertexAI API calls that businesses are using across all \*their\* AI use cases**. Better yet, PerformanceMax will automatically allocate budget to this new AI advertising and track the performance of it along with all the rest of the ridiculous ad spend you’re pushing through Google Ads. This hasn’t been announced yet, but the writing is on the wall (or in the AI, or something). Will it be next earnings release? Not sure.

# Google price is being held down by calls expiring this Friday

Well, all this sounds great - but besides all the anti-wokeness pressure on the stock, why now?

You regards hopefully know about Cem Karsan and his options market expertise – if not then you should probably give up or just buy GOOGL calls and call it a day.

Last week on this [Top Traders Unplugged podcast](https://www.toptradersunplugged.com/podcast/285-systematic-investor-series-ft-cem-karsan-march-2nd-2024/) Cem talked about how we’re coming into a huge options expiry this Friday for the single name options. There’s a large amount of open interest on big NASDAQ names like GOOGL that are suppressing stock price. As the OTM short calls held by MM’s get close to expiry, the delta decays, meaning the MM’s need to sell the underlying in order to stay hedged. While the AI names have been on a tear for the past month, the rest of the Mag7 has suffered because of this dynamic.

Well, Friday’s coming quickly. Will the lid come off so the non-NVIDIA Mag7 can return to greatness? Will the market realize that Google is a take-no-prisoners money printing machine who has systematically removed woke slackers from their ranks over the past year? We will see.

# Google go up becus Jeo Boden

Finally, in case you’re living under a rock, it’s worth reminding you that it’s an election year and Powell won’t be able to close the fucking door for long if he gets fired by Doland Tremp next year. Powell is going to stay loose with monetary policy, pumping up asset prices. Google is king, and the king is going to be drunk on liquidity this year.

2024-03-19 11:04:40,1ncehost,DD: I DD'd the nvidia run up last year ($250->$700) and was right. Now I have a new prediction,"Here's my nvidia DD from last year (NVDA was $250 and I predicted $700 within a year): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd\_nvda\_to\_700\_by\_this\_time\_next\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd_nvda_to_700_by_this_time_next_year/)

Last week I timed the exit on my BTC and QQQ holdings fairly well. **Now I'm setting my sights on a new horizon: AMD**

AMD is sort of like the nice ugly step sister of hot bae nvidia. Everyone ""likes"" her, but she doesn't get invited to parties and no one takes her seriously. Right now reminds me of Ryzen 1. When AMD was $12, I predicted AMD's stock price would triple in the next two years due to how well the architecture fit with datacenter needs. I posted my DD here and was right. It took most people by surprise because at the time Intel had 99% of the datacenter CPU market. Now we look at $180+ AMD price. I think we are once again going to be surprised by su bae and co.

I'll get to my evidence that AMD will exceed expectations yet again, but first I want to address some obvious points of skepticism.

1. **Firstly AMD's seemingly absurd P/E ratio of 364:** I'm going to show that not only is AMD's revenue going to go up by an absurd amount in the next year, but also its net income margin. Nvidia operates at around 50% income right now and AMD is operating at around 20% right now. That gap is going to close considerably in the next year. I'm estimating AMD will reach around 35-40% net income. On top of that AMD will grow revenue by 50% in the next year (wishful thinking would say as high as 70% more revenue) exclusively due to AI accelerators. This will all lead to considerably more realistic P/E ratio.
2. **Next Nvidia's control on the market:** The evidence points to this being a detriment to Nvidia. AI companies are looking to diversify from Nvidia because they don't want to be vendor-locked, Nvidia has a 1 year back order on its top AI accelerators, and Nvidia's massive profit margin makes it easy to undercut their price. Furthermore, CUDA dominance is highly exaggerated today. I use this stuff every day, and ROCm is absolutely production ready, especially for large companies who have the staff to optimize for it. The people who say ROCm sucks haven't used it in a while -- AMD is working on it at a break neck pace.

# Now on to my DD

The debate about AMD's price largely boils down to its newest AI accelerator's value (the MI300X) versus Nvidia's current AI accelerator (the H100). AI accelerators are now most of the accelerator market (including GPUs), and also have the highest profit margins by far, so they are basically 80% of the valuation on these companies' stock prices. Yes the H200 and the new GB200 are coming out soon for Nvidia, but the MI300X has a timing lead on them which enables it to get some foothold. So for the moment, its MI300X vs H100 for companies deciding what to buy.

**Accelerator Value:** Reviews for the MI300X are going to come out imminently (within a few weeks), and we will begin seeing hard evidence for its value proposition then. I have spent a lot of time on older AMD cards analyzing their performance versus big green. My findings are that generally AMD is capable of being as fast or faster than Nvidia, but most open source projects are optimized better for Nvidia so in the real world AMD has a performance disadvantage. However in the case of the MI300X, its raw performance is so large over an H100, it will likely produce slightly better real world performance. Also the MI300X is selling for around $25k per card (you can buy it right now [https://www.thinkmate.com/system/a+-server-8125gs-tnmr2](https://www.thinkmate.com/system/a+-server-8125gs-tnmr2)) where the H100 is around $40k, so companies will be looking at benchmarks in a couple weeks that point to the MI300X being slightly faster and considerably less expensive.

**Nvidia supply constraint:** Nvidia has a back order of around a year for their latest AI accelerators. This means if a company needs to immediately purchase accelerators for a new project, they simply can't from Nvidia at scale. AMD's order books are currently open, but probably filling fast for this reason.

**Announced customers:** Meta is going to be the largest customer for the MI300X. They have indirectly announced that they will purchase up to almost half of their 600k accelerators this year from AMD ([https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/meta\_ai\_chips/](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/meta_ai_chips/)). This customer alone will add 25% to AMD's revenue and improve their profit margin from 20% to roughly 28%. MS has already started deploying the MI300X on Azure and Oracle has announced they will launch VMs with them, but neither has announced numbers. Who won't be using AMD? OpenAI has a multi-year contract with nvidia, and Google uses their own proprietary TPU.

**AI accelerator headwind:** The AI accelerator market is expected to have a CAGR of over 20% for the next 5+ years. This means there will be continued supply constraints that incentivize diversifying hardware. New players inherently have an advantage because of this. It just happens that AMD is the next new player to be mature and scaled enough for widespread adoption. Yes Intel and startups will probably do fine also, but AMD is seeing ridiculous growth at this very moment that hasn't appeared on their earnings report yet (fulfillment for the MI300X did not ramp up until roughly January). There is such a ridiculous amount of demand in this ai accelerator market that everyone in it will grow.

# My price target: $450 AMD

After doing some napkin math on the market, I think it is reasonable for AMD to acquire 15-20% of the AI accelerator market by the end of the year, up from an inconsequential market share before. This includes speculation about AMD's product competitiveness, their ability to scale, the customers that will be interested in buying AMD, market growth, and new Nvidia product launches. Extrapolating that marketshare into net income by using a rough margin per card and using Nvidia's P/E ratio as a baseline model, translates to an AMD fair stock price of around $450 by the end of the year.

AMD's price will start to go up after the MI300X reviews come out and rumors of their customer acquisitions come in. The May earnings report will be where it starts to appear on their books, but they are still ramping up right now and Q2 is where we will see the largest earnings growth.

**My positions are: $190 6/21C and $200 10/18C**

That's all. See you later this year."

Two main reasons why AAPL has been lagging: slowing growth (mainly China) and lack of AI hype. The slowing growth is priced into the stock. Earnings expectations are already low for AAPL.  

AAPL reminds me of GOOGL this year when it was in similar situation of dumpster fire but then broke out after it finally worked out Gemini. AAPL already told you that it's going to make a push to AI, which should mean multiple expansion for AAPL stock. My guess is that in June we'll see Siri being totally revamped and actually be useful. Don't get me wrong this June WWDC event needs to be successful or this stock will stay dumpster fire. We need to see some sort of hype and the market needs to be convinced that that the next iphone will be a must-have due its new AI features. If there's anyone who can market the shit out of anything, it's AAPL.

The whole kitchen sink was thrown at AAPL recently. You have dissapointing product launch of its Vision Pro. You have the news about negative China sales. You have this big DOJ case come out of no where. You had an analyst downgrade yesterday. And even with all of that, it didn't make a new low from March 6th. Unless there's an unexpected market-wide correction, I can't see AAPL going lower this year.

This whole market recently has been a rotation trade. That is why the market has gone up even without AAPL and now without NVDA. The market has been broadening. It will continue to find laggards and re-allocate money from hot areas. AAPL is that obvious laggard right now and it needs to eventually participate for the market to continue signficiantly higher.

And it's not like he was just a bystander, he was in charge of research and development for Yahoo's search and ads products. But wait, it gets better.

These guys have a good feel for spending. Their latest consumer spending report:

* Total card spending per household rose 0.3% year-over-year (YoY) in March, following the leap-year boosted 2.9% YoY increase in February, according to Bank of America aggregated credit debit card data. The early Easter holiday likely brought some spending from April into March. Controlling for these seasonal impacts, spending fell 0.7% month-over-month (MoM).
* While spending was soft on the month, the solid labor market continues to sustain consumer momentum. March saw strong jobs growth, and this appears to be reflected in strengthening after-tax wages and salaries growth in our data – with growth at the highest level since early 2023.
* Tax refunds may also provide additional support to households, with average refunds up by 5% this year through the end of March. While most consumers appear to be planning to save or pay down debt, there is a small rise in people saying they will go shopping.
* We are seeing signs that easing rent inflation is providing a tailwind to renters' spending. Renters' spending growth appears to be improving most in retail categories.

Low Ticket items, relative to high, like cars and computers are guess who's specialty? Bezo's little Jungle. Yup. But guess what else is doing super cool and bueno these days? CLOUD computing, cuz all that AI compute has to live SOMEWHERE!! and it sure as hell won't be your personal computer lil bitch. It will be on the vast farms of computer these juggernauts control. 

AWS has massive patterns of purchase, and consumable data, like movies and products and services. They are now in the Pharma business, Medical Insurance, Home Insurance. Talk about spreading your eggs in several baskets. Movies? socks? Tampons? whaddya need? oh and you don't need to drive anywhere for it either. 

""The report followed news last week that [job](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-job-growth-beats-expectations-march-wages-increase-steadily-2024-04-05/) growth accelerated in March, with the unemployment rate slipping to 3.8% from 3.9% in February. The stubbornly higher cost of living looms large over the Nov. 5 presidential election. Still, there were some silver linings, with food prices at the supermarket unchanged and the cost of motor vehicles declining, leading to the return of goods deflation.""

Car prices are going down because there is less spending on large ticket items. The consumer trend is strong in certain areas where Amazon benefits. And growth of AI to supplant workers in many areas is only growing. So Amazon is growing. And crypto acceptance is growing which gives Amazon even more leverage as AWS is used Blockchain services:

2024-06-03 07:13:21,SDF_IT,I have been stalking local Bath and Body Work stores for 5 months and believe they are going to crush earnings.,"Edit - Well damn. EPS and revenue beat but guidance is king these days. Holding onto the calls at this point in case a miracle happens but counting the full 8k as a loss. Only down 1.7k on shares so far but if it does the same thing it has done the last 3 quarters, it will rebound to new highs so not too worried. Congratulations to all the Bears and better luck next time to all the Bulls with me.

I believe BBWI is going to crush earnings based on 5 months of store stalking and no one is talking about it. Literally not one mention about earnings on wallstreetbets. TLDR at the end.

**Background:**

I have been on paternity leave for a little over 5 months now. I live 20 minutes away from 3 different malls and thought I walking around them for an hour or two every day would be a great way to kill some time while also letting my newborn see new things. Around the same time I watched a video on how a Chinese coffee shop got outed for fake financials by people literally watching the store and counting the number of people buying things. That gave me the idea to track how many people were in stores and how many shopping bags I saw around the mall from each store indicating a purchase. Obviously there is a major difference between dozens of people watching stores vs just little old me but the data I gathered has been spot on for earning beats on what I considered to be outliers. The stores that have surprised me with their high volume are Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, Urban Outfitters, Sephora, and of course Bath and Body Works.

**Method:**

All in all I have 124 days worth of data so far. I usually only visit one mall a day but sometimes two. Any day of the week and usually between 12pm and 5pm. I try and park at different entrances so I don’t get biased in my counting of bags because I park right next to one store or another. I go to three different malls each catering to a different economic class. Pretty much lower, middle, and high income. I do 2 passes, about and hour apart, of each store I am tracking. I count the number of customers in the store. While I walk around, I also count the number of bags I see from each store. This is a bit harder to trust though as people with multiple bags usually condense into one. So stores with small bags (looking at you Sephora) are underrepresented. I would occasionally go into BBWI and count the items in people carts too but only did this a handful of times.

**Data:**

The average number of people I have seen at BBWI is 9.82 on weekdays and 23.68 on weekends. This crushes the average from all the stores I tracked which was 2.98 on weekdays and 8.2 on weekends. The only store with a higher average was Sephora which was 10.36 and 25.25 respectfully. All three malls had similar numbers with the higher income mall being slightly higher but not enough to note. I think this was due to young girls traveling in packs of 3 or 4 which I didn’t see at the other two malls.

The average number of bags (aka purchases) for BBWI was 4.1 on weekdays and 11.67 on weekends. Which again crushes the average of just 1.45 and 3.11.

For some context here are pictures of the check out line Saturday 30 minutes apart. Wanted to hide people because I think it is rude for a random stranger to snap pictures of people and post them online. There are currently multiple tellers checking out customers with 5 more people in line.

**Other Things to Note**

**Male Skin Care** \- Something I didn’t track, but surprised me, was the number of males in the store alone or with another guy (this goes for Sephora as well). Doing a bit of research on the topic of men's skin care shows a 6.2% year over year growth and a 389% increase in TikTok videos on the subject in the last year. I think it is actually going to be higher based on what I am seeing at the stores and Gen Z starting to come into their own money. That generation has pushed the needle on male beauty standards much more towards the feminine astatic (think Timothee, Lil Nas X, Brady Potter, Jungkook) and with that comes skincare. This is a huge expanding market that is just getting tapped into and based on what I am seeing in person they are capturing the market well.

https://preview.redd.it/cnqrxy5s6d4d1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b67bd389c4be5640f80f193f0e128ce3ba71d4e1

**Dupe Culture** \- This has been on the rise over the last year but it is starting to snowball now. Gen Z and Millennials are finally starting to push back on the, “buy the brand not the product” mentality. This was evident with E.L.F.s recent earning report and will be echoed in BBWI. Their house products have been praised for matching much more expensive fragrances. Paulreactss is one of the most popular fragrance TikTokers with 1.5 million subscribers and he has videos identifying BBWI scents that dupe much more expensive variations. Seriously just google Bath and Body Works dupes and you will see tons of people gushing about what BBWI has to offer and people saying they bought tons of their new product line that came out in the end of Q1.

**Subreddit** \- The Bath and Body Works subreddit has 86k subscribers. Just yesterday there is a post from an associate saying they are flooded with orders from their summer sales and people are buying literally entire lots of items. [https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/1d6t0dr/from\_an\_associate\_to\_customers\_we\_love\_you\_but/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/1d6t0dr/from_an_associate_to_customers_we_love_you_but/)

Notable quotes from the thread:  
""It’s just been the second day of SAS and already we’ve gotten over 100+ BOPIS orders placed""  
""...and bringing in 2 or more baskets of items is just not only exhausting but also unfair to the other customers who would’ve wanted to get certain products but now can’t because someone else decided to buy all 10 sprays that were JUST put out...""  
""Yep I felt so bad for my friends because everytime they went on break or even took a second to look away from the bopis, the number would go back to 99+""

**TLDR** \- I have been to a Bath and Body Works over 250 times in the last 5 months to count the number of customers in the store. It has crushed my expectations. This coupled with male skin care rising and dupe brands like E.L.F. crushing earnings leads me to believe BBWI is going to kill earnings.

2024-06-13 06:43:20,Excellent_Ability793,AI trade reminds me of the telecom bubble at the turn of the century.,"Just wanted to share a few thoughts I have related to the current state of the AI buildout and get your feedback.

The AI buildout reminds me a lot of the late 90s and early 00s when there was a race to build out large telecommunications networks to provide the bandwidth to support all of the new activity that would take place on the rapidly rising technology. 

Companies like Cisco and Lucent went parabolic as a large number of embedded providers (AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, etc) and new entrants (Qwest, Level 3, Global Crossings, etc) received large amounts of capital to build out new IP networks.

The problem was that the investment in network infrastructure greatly outpaced people’s ability to monetize it.  It took nearly two decades to absorb the network capacity glut and there were only a couple winners when it was all said and done, with a ton of companies absorbed and destroyed in its wake.  Cisco still hasn’t reached its all time high over two decades later and Lucent and other equipment providers lost a ton of value and were absorbed as demand for their products declined sharply.  And the winners of the internet buildout were not the companies being touted during the dotcom bubble.

I feel like we’re in the early stages of a similar cycle.  NVDA is like the telco equipment providers with the added benefit of not having any real competition and there are so many companies rapidly deploying their chips to make sure they get in on the AI game.  I think NVDA will continue to soar until the buildout is complete.  Large companies like Microsoft, Google, and Apple are racing to build capacity just like the telecommunications service providers back in the day and there are a bunch of new entrants fighting for mindshare.  Unfortunately no one has really figured out how to monetize the technology yet.

My prediction is that the AI trade over the next two years will looks like the culmination of the telecommunications bubble.  Huge ramp over the next two years as companies race to build out capabilities, followed by a rapid decline as companies fail to figure out how to monetize the investment.  NVDA will stick around but after it reaches its ATH it will struggle like Cisco did after the capacity glut is reached and the folks that actually figure out how to monetize AI will be different than a lot of the companies that are being bet on now.

TLDR, u think we’re in the beginning of a bubble due to rapid capacity buildout, followed by a crash when the industry can’t monetize the technology fast enough to pay back the investment, and then steady growth as the technology matures and new entrants rise on new and unforeseen AI applications.

What do you all think?"
2024-06-14 01:47:06,jeffkeeg,You don't understand AI hype,"I have been a lurker on WSB for some time *(ignore the account age)*, despite my lack of activity, and I’ve noticed a recent uptick in posts discussing AI hype and how it’s surely a bubble ready to pop. This is obviously due in large part to the recent NVDA explosion, but there’s more to consider.

While you guys spend most of your time focused on the money and investments side of AI, I spend my time focused on the technology itself – and the beliefs that seem to emanate from it.

Let’s look at NVDA. Right now, NVDA is making its mark on the world almost entirely due to its ability to produce and supply cutting edge GPUs for companies looking to fashion larger and larger clusters and have more compute than any reasonable person could possibly fathom. Surely, this ends at some point, right? Surely, the people in charge realize that they’ve built large enough GPU clusters *(never mind the hundreds of billions recently committed to building the largest datacenters on the planet by the likes of Google and Microsoft)* and Jensen stops getting orders. Surely, this ends.

A lot of people have been comparing AI hype to the dot com bubble of the early 2000s, which seems to be a fair comparison on a surface level. However, this misses something so fundamentally different about AI today that it almost entirely invalidates it.

Whether you think AI is real or a scam or a stochastic parrot or whatever, the people in charge *(Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook, etc)* believe 100% that this is one of the final pieces of technology mankind will ever create. They believe that the first company that creates AGI *(artificial general intelligence – typically defined as an AI that can do any task as well as the average person)* will be the first company to create ASI *(artificial superintelligence – typically defined as an AI that is smarter than every single living human being put together)* and will end up deciding the future. And they believe this is going to happen in ten to fifteen years.

If this seems silly to you, I don’t blame you. Technology typically doesn’t move especially fast or change too much over short amounts of time. It’s not like a refrigerator purchased today is a wildly different beast than one purchased fifty years ago. Sure, it might be more efficient and have more room, but fundamentally it’s the same technology.

This is how life has been ever since the industrial revolution: a new technology is invented, distributed, and then refined over the next 50 years until it basically asymptotes.

That is not what is happening with AI, and it isn’t what is going to happen in the future. Progress is being made at a blistering rate. People who aren't constantly paying attention to every single development and published paper have no idea what's going on. They just wake up one day and go ""Oh wow look at that, AI can just make videos and music out of nowhere. This must be something that was developed overnight and is a magical thing that can only happen once or twice in my life. Any discussion about further development is silly and just hype!""

Whether you like it, believe it, or even choose to acknowledge it, AI isn’t in a hype bubble this time. It’s easy enough to look back at the last half-century and see AI’s previous bubble bursts, but those were due in large part to the technology itself being substandard. It’s hard to make ASI when your supercomputer has less computing power than the first iPhone in 2007. This is why today’s companies are pouring what seems like an unreasonable and unjustifiable amount of money into buying GPUs – and why they will continue to. Everyone has realized that compute is all you need.

Whether or not this ends up making “god in a box” isn’t especially important. What is important is that the companies trying to do it aren’t going to stop anytime soon. The risk/reward on trying to build the final thing mankind will ever build is so astronomically skewed that it’s hardly even a consideration. The reward for success is so vast that it makes the cost of failure *(a few hundred billion dollars)* seem insignificant.

I’m not trying to sell you on NVDA or MSFT or anything like that, I’m just trying to let you know what’s actually going on. You can’t sit there and say “I looked on the internet and saw a tech bubble from before I was born, that must mean this is the same thing!” because that makes you wrong. You fundamentally misunderstand what’s happening in tech right now if you think this is going to follow conventional patterns. This is a once in a lifetime event, and it might very well succeed."

-Worries over GDP numbers tomorrow coming in worse than expected

-TSLA and GOOG/GOOGL destroyed the market out of pure happenstance that it caused a chain reaction throughout the market as a whole.

I've done a bit of reading and I think the first theory is more probable as GDP is already expected to come in lower than Q1. It won't be enough to spur on a recession as ""healthy consumer spending"" helped a slow decline. GDP will still be up at least 1.8%, I don't expect anything less but I'm also not an economist so I can't say much to that point.

Moral of the story: I believe today is a result of worries from a nothing burger of what we all pretty much expected. "
2024-07-24 09:35:22,plutrons,but GOOGLE beat earnings!,
2024-07-25 17:05:02,401kLover,I spend $4m a year facebook ads and I'm shorting $META earnings,"This is a play based purely on anecdotal experience in the ecommerce space. Here's the anecdotal take:

I started my ecom business 7 years ago and have built it on the back of the meta ads platform. Year over year we were able to grow and increase our spend. Last year we did around 9m, with 4m spend on Meta. This year, we're down about 30% on revenue and the efficiency of our META spend is down 10%. I'm in groups with hundreds of other founders, and this is the same situation for about 80% of the members in these groups. Just head on over to r/facebookads and look at all the depressing posts lol. Ask anyone you know who works in ecom how their company is doing this year.

The internal reality at Meta is that the ads platform is totally fucked up right now, more so than after the iOS update that sent the stock to $100, and barely anyone is talking about it. Google the stock and all you'll find is that 100% of analysts agree that it's a strong BUY, talking about AI and literally not mentioning the ad business (which effectively drives 100% of META revenue). In November 2022, when facebook was at $100, all the same analysts said META was dead and to stay away.

Also, I'm not a TA guy, but just look at that fuckin chart. Straight up for like 20 months. Looks toppy as hell.

In the 7 years of owning my business, all of my biggest pay days have come from anecdotal meta earnings call plays. This is nearly an identical situation to when the iOS update broke the ads platform while they were simultaneously blowing money on the metaverse, except nobody knows exactly what broke the ads platform (including facebook) and the multi billion dollar pit is their AI investment currently driving 0 revenue. I'm confident at the very least META EPS will be an underwhelming beat like google or a miss. They'll do damage control by saying ""AI"" 250+ times on the earnings call but that didn't work for Google so I don't see it working for them either.

I've got 15k worth of options, positions below. This is some purely anecdotal gambling, do with it what you will. Not financial advice 

Positions [https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg)

EDIT: Wow this blew up. Some clarifications:

1) I'M GAMBLING YALL. Anecdotal evidence does not paint a full picture, obviosuly. But each of the massive multi year moves up and down by Meta over the last few years were felt first by advertisers. General advertising performance has worked as a leading indicator multiple times before, and the ads platform has had loads of issues this year.

2) I think META is a great long term investment. I very much plan to continue spending my money on it, it's the dominant platform in the ad space by a long shot. But I also think its in a really good spot to take a fat shit in the short term. That's the play guys, I dont think Meta is going to die, I think its going to dip.

3) My business did 9m last year, but as I stated, I spent half of that shit on fucking facebook ads. Considering we have to also, ya know, purchase the products, pay for shipping, staff, software subscriptions, hosting, etc. Net income generally lands between 7-10% of total revenue, and much of that get's reinvested back into the business. I make good money, but I'm not just rolling in cash. It's money I can afford to lose, but lol at everyone calling 15k on weeklies for an earnings play peanuts. Playing earnings is risky no matter your conviction levels.

There's so many factors that can play into an earnings call. Anyone with aggressive certainty going into an earnings call is an idiot, you can be right and get reamed by a stock buy back. But I personally feel strongly enough about the information to make a bet, and I'm sharing that insight with you guys cuz I haven't seen many people talking about it. If I'm right, this could easily be a 5-10x play. If I'm wrong, I lose. That's gambling you pussies.

Edit: I am, in fact, cooked."
2024-07-28 07:33:27,Rauf_KB,$GOOGL Google is in a big trouble in the long run - here is why.,"Let's do the math directly and take a look at Google ads results in 2023:

- The revenue generated by Google ads in 2023 is $237 billion.

- The revenue portion from Google search engine is around 60%!!! That means out of the $237 billion, around $142 billion revenue is generated from the search engine or search ads.

- Google's total revenue for 2023 was $305 billion, that means the revenue from the search engine only (not entire Google ads) makes around 45% of Google's total revenue.

Now the second search engine behind Google is Microsoft Bing, Microsoft generated in 2023 only $12 Billion from Bing ads.

Google by far is the dominant as for now, and Microsoft although in the second place behind them, won't be able to reach even a quarter of Google's revenue, they had many failed attempts to promote Bing.

Now some of you probably heared about the upcoming releases of SearchGPT, whoever tried ChatGPT will know it's by far better than Gemini and the other AI models, if Openai released their SearchGPT and people switched from Google search to SearchGPT (which I personally think will happen), Google in this case will keep 45% of its total revenue vulnerable by SearchGPT.

TL;DR Google have strong exposure to its search engine, the revenue generated from the search engine is around 45% of its total revenue, with the upcoming release of SearchGPT, Google may lose its dominance in the long term which may cause their revenue growth to stop or decline.

However, people that actually manage money will not ignore deteriorating economic data. They will sell stocks in order to try to time the market. If you're dollar cost averaging, then good for you, but the majority of people here (and on wallstreet) are trying to time the markets to speed up the process of making money. And you don't make money by buying a 5% dip after a 40% rally if you believe that a recession might be coming. 

People have been leveraging like crazy and are going through the 5 stages of grief now that the market went against them. Every time that someone complains that they are down on Nvidia, the most upvoted comment under it is ""don't worry bro, just hold because it will be at $180 in 6 months"". Anecdotally, it seems like everyone's uncle and inheritor of money is all-in on AI. For it to go even higher, someone has to be buying at higher prices. It also has to start making some serious money for the companies who are spending tens of billion of dollars on it. So far, Microsoft and Google are struggling to monetize it relative to the expectations that were being priced in. 

We haven't had a recession since 2008. Covid doesn't count. The fed raised rates and the economy didn't give two shits. If the fed lowers rates, why is the economy magically expected to get better immediately? These are serious concerns and if you think buying the ""dip"" right now is a no-brainer move, then you have no brain. We were at all-time highs 3 weeks ago and deteriorating economic data doesn't flip overnight. Neither do the concerns about it. These last couple of weeks have laid out very important information about what the market as a whole cares about and will rally or crash because of. Lots of people seem to be ignoring this and sticking their head in the sand. Good luck.

Edit: From the hundred or so comments that disagree with me, here's a summary of the sentiment. People think that a deteriorating economy is bullish because the fed will cut rates faster. They think the fed and government will pump money into the economy to keep it going and that's bullish. While I don't disagree with that, I also think that this is a poor argument to buy the dip at nearly an all-time high, especially if you're hoping for quick profits. Stocks will eventually go up simply because the value of the dollar will continue to get inflated away, but you can spend years holding the bag and being in the red. People will try to avoid this and sell their stocks to buy at a lower price later on. If a recession actually occurs, there will be lots of selling soon. Also, I'm not necessarily predicting a recession, I'm making a simple observation of the data and how the market has been reacting to it. For a while, the market has been ignoring bad data and rallying on rate-cut optimism. It is now doing the opposite. This is a very important observation if you want to make predictions.

Edit 2: I've read every comment on this post and it's pretty clear that there is a substantial fear of missing out on the next rally. A lot of people are horrified at the idea of sitting out of the market for a while, let alone going short. This makes me more certain that we've topped out for now and that the upside risk is low. Too many people just NEED to be in the market right now, and they find ways to justify this."

2024-08-07 05:12:05,shopperdocket,Update: I spent a quarter million dollars on rocks. ,"**Previous Post:** 

[~https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xqubya/my\_dd\_advocating\_a\_long\_position\_of\_gemstone/~](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xqubya/my_dd_advocating_a_long_position_of_gemstone/)

**Summary:** For the last four years I have been buying rocks, a lot of rocks. My hypothesis is that these rocks will dramatically appreciate in value due to an increased market awareness, combined with geopolitical and socio-economic transference.   

**Introduction:** In March 2020, when the entire world was preparing for a global pandemic, I decided it was a good idea to take a vacation to Cambodia. At the time, everyone around me was telling me, this was perhaps not a very good idea. A risky idea, an idea with more downsides than up. A poor investment. I rejected this advice, and convinced my girlfriend to come with me. Four days after we arrived, the world was locked down and all the hotels in the country were closed. Our new home for the foreseeable future was in an empty resort in the most remote corner of Cambodia. 

It was here where I [~discovered Blue Zircon.~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17_BOLj3xlWDkaT2rC6LCi1RqpgBHG4iu/view?usp=sharing)

**A deep value asset:** With all the time in the world, nowhere to be and nothing to do, I spent every waking moment learning everything I could about this curious rock. I came to the conclusion that [~Blue Zircon was woefully undervalued and primed for exponential growth.~](https://youtu.be/kwprPvO-YD4?si=biaxx0hxBFFeIr9g)

At the time, you could visit the mines outside of town and buy a fist full of raw unfaceted blue zircon for around $0.30 per stone. This was to be my cost basis moving forward. 

What initially got my attention was: 

1. [~Blue Zircon is the oldest gemstone on Earth.~ ](https://www.science.org/content/article/oldest-piece-earth-discovered)
2. [~Blue Zircon is rarer than diamond.~ ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Z0FkxZjwPKFcKSd_3wnflcyFUIom8Cj/view?usp=sharing)
3. [~Blue Zircon boasts double refraction~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12_tiQU9XtBlTrCnt7ObjHCCZetDqepM2/view?usp=sharing) compared to [~diamonds single refraction.~ ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gMaUCJ1I7Rgzqzhipq_OZycxS1zFk0Ho/view?usp=sharing)

What compounded my belief, was that:

1. [~Tiffany and Co attempted the same idea more than a hundred years ago.~  ](https://www.palagems.com/kunz-reminiscences1#block-yui_3_17_2_11_1430500935587_16406)
2. [~Oscar Wilde was a huge fan~ ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GCaAyN55a_id7iGd-oWw-wyT7v2dySRQ/view?usp=sharing)
3. [~There is a precedent of niche gemstones going exponential~](https://www.theraregemstonecompany.com/gemology-articles/tanzanite-prices-and-value-current-and-historically).
4. [~Cambodia is the primary source of the world supply of Blue Zircon.~](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325661388_Blue_Zircon_from_Ratanakiri_Cambodia)

What finally convinced me to go all-in; was a decree from the Cambodian government; which [~outlawed mining and began closing the vast majority of gemstone mines.~ ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B6_ILoea_0DCc3OH3kRJKJAvjB_1S_xp/view?usp=sharing)

Other factors, though less obvious at the time, are what gave me the confidence to begin work on a much longer term play. Specifically [~The rise of Asia’s middle Class~](https://www.futuresplatform.com/blog/asia-growing-middle-class-reshaping-global-consumption#:~:text=THE%20MIDDLE%20CLASS%20OF%20ASIA,technology%2C%20wellness%2C%20and%20infrastructure.) and [~China's pivot away from diamond~](https://rapaport.com/analysis/whats-causing-chinas-diamond-slump/), towards assets that are ‘closer to home’.   
  
Now that I had convinced myself of the value of the underlying asset, I secured the required permits, [~filled my bags~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16I_XYf6bQnLHJHrsT014jaj6I6GPcqwp/view?usp=drive_link) and [~headed back to Australia~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lSG4NsaNuNh76qMnebBqoKGedDuMCkSc/view?usp=sharing). Where I formed a ltd company with the primary strategy of acquiring a controlling interest in the world’s supply of Blue Zircon, the only problem was that I didn’t have enough capital to do it alone, [~so I put up an advertisement, in the only place where I thought I could find other people foolish enough to help.~ ](https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/350095914/#350095914)

From here, we started buying; online and offline, for years we set about attempting to buy every spare blue rock we could find. We bought directly from the mines until they ran out due to widespread closures, then focused our attention online. During this time, I increased my combined holdings of raw & faceted stones up to [~more than 1 million carats~](https://canadianjeweller.com/nyblue-pty-ltd-spearheads-global-acquisition-of-rare-cambodian-blue-zircon-eyeing-market-leadership/). 

Since my previous post, the average market price per stone has increased 10X [~Our plot was exposed, however the asset is still unknown.~ ](https://medium.com/@NellieBly_Official/secret-group-plotting-to-dominate-global-gemstone-market-4bb54f4e9085)  
  
**Updates:** Since I last posted here, the price per carat has surpassed $300 however it does still fluctuate a bit, though this is before we’ve initiated the global marketing campaign. 

I’ve noticed more celebrities wearing blue rocks, such as [~Reece Witherspoon~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pAL4wfR9GD_8iullVD7i3oCEC_VWiWlG/view?usp=sharing) and potentially even [~Taylor Swift~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TAS3dy6p4Hs7vY7ngw7TiWnWYbT3Qmu7/view?usp=drive_link). Both signify a potential market rally. 

The next step is to set up a way to facilitate a ‘spot price’ as currently, I rely on a web crawler to monitor changes in market price & depth. Additionally, I’m working with some interested parties to develop an international social & mainstream media campaign, along with a dose of [~weaponized memes~](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WaIY28J6-Y8AkG99YpC8dx8yRTef7WCh?usp=sharing) to raise awareness of this wonderful rock. 

**My current position:** 

~1,000,000 cts of~ [~Raw~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16I_XYf6bQnLHJHrsT014jaj6I6GPcqwp/view?usp=drive_link) & Faceted Blue Zircon

2024-08-11 08:33:52,NotBanksy69,It’s time we acknowledge that calls and longs are the play for NVDA. Long DD.,"No pun intended but this will not take long. Please accept this simple DD on why you should be longing NVDA leading up to earnings. 


1) There seems to be no end in sight with Jensen’s ability to juice earnings releases. Is it the leather jacket? No. Well we don’t know for sure, but the last six ERs have resulted in an average reaction of roughly +8.5%. Isn’t that what Buffet earns on an annual basis?


2) Look at the chart. I’m not usually one for technical analysis, but it’s quite clear reviewing the chart on my Apple iPhone’s stocks app that we’ve reached the bottom of this selloff. Image attached for your reference. 


3) The delay in Blackwell chip rollout is not a big deal if it’s even real. Jensen has been clear that demand for Hopper still exceeds supply. Someone did the math previously, but any impact of a 3 month delay is mitigated by the fact that they’ll simply sell more H200. Just Google “Blackwell delay” and you’ll see lots of articles on sites you’ve never heard of confirming the same.


4. Nancy Pelosi is still buying. She’s probably already seen the AGI locked in Sam’s basement. Don’t forget, this entire AI wave was kicked off by ChatGPT. That’s just the very tip of the AI iceberg that’s about to change the course of humanity’s future. Any upcoming product releases from the big players in this space are only going to reignite excitement for this technology and thusly shares of NVDA.


My position: Very sensible 9/20 $100 and 12/20 $110 strike calls, shares. Not financial advice. Thank you for reading."

2024-08-28 17:31:43,Fun-Negotiation-9046,Short term Nvidia call holders- it's over. ,"Seeing so many comments and threads of people asking if their $130 8/30 calls will still print followed by the equally delusional regards replying about how the market will magically gap up 12-15% by market open tomorrow, erase all losses today, and somehow pump enough for their 1dte far OTM options to be back in the green.

No, it's not going to happen. I'm by no means saying that this AI hype/Nvidia is done for, but large runups like these absolutely do need a cool-down period as a break. No stock can sustain Nvidia type growth for years on end. Nvidia has blown so many earnings reports out of the water, this time it essentially had to face the impossible task to beat the expectations to beat the sky high expectations of beating analyst predictions. On top of that 99% of the posts and comments I've seen on WSB were NVDA earnings extreme bulls, so that alone should've told you something. 

Again, I'm not saying that this run is over and Nvidia will go to zero- I still think it's fundamentally a great company and has clear long-term growth potential. A LOT of people are comparing this to the dot-com bubble, but what people don't realize is that bubbles usually tend to eradicate the smaller BS companies that base their entire business on AI to piggyback the hype. Nvidia is comparable to Google, Meta, or Apple back then, and will likely be perfectly fine. 

What I think will mostly happen is that, again, soon DTE calls would go completely or near worthless in the next few weeks as Nvidia regresses and enters the backburners in terms of the overall rotation leading up to the election, and will continue its rally soon after. 

Positions: An assortment of strike 120, 122, 123, and 124 8/30 puts, 120/123 8/30 debit put spreads. Will soon add some longer DTE leaps. 

TL;DR: Your 8/30 or 9/6 NVDA calls are done for. There will be no magical 15% gap up tomorrow. LEAP holders are likely fine, and start buying shares if we dip further.

2024-09-03 12:35:35,JohnnyTheBoneless,Reddit's partnership with Google is worth closer to $50M per quarter rather than the reported $15M,"In previous posts, I shared some data on the root cause of Reddit's substantial user growth over the past few quarters: Google.

More specifically, my view is that Google has been using their ""Helpful Content Update"" series of ""core updates"" to their search engine to significantly boost the visibility of Reddit's content. This has been happening for the past 3-4 quarters.

**Partnership deal starting Q1 2024 worth $15.6M per quarter through Q1 2027**

In February 2024, the media [reported on](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/22/reddit-says-its-made-203m-so-far-licensing-its-data/) the newly announced Data Licensing partnership between Google and Reddit. The terms, as reported, looked like this:

>In January 2024, we entered into certain data licensing arrangements with an aggregate contract value of $203.0 million and terms ranging from two to three years. We expect a minimum of $66.4 million of revenue to be recognized during the year ending December 31, 2024 and the remaining thereafter.

When I first read about this deal, I was surprised at how low Reddit went on Google's license, especially since Sam Altman *hates* Google. $15M per quarter is a drop in the bucket for Google and doesn't move the needle much for Reddit either. If you look at the deal from the lens of increased search engine visibility, **the** ***actual*** **value of the deal is closer to $50M per quarter (perhaps even higher)** for Reddit.

**How Reddit and Google reported their partnership**

From [Reddit's announcement](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-and-google-expand-partnership):

>**With this partnership**, and via our Data API, **we’re ushering in new ways for Reddit content to be displayed across Google products** by providing programmatic access to new, constantly evolving, and dynamic public posts, comments, etc., on Reddit. **This enhanced collaboration** provides Google with an efficient and structured way to access the vast corpus of existing content on Reddit and **enables Google to use the Reddit Data API to improve its products and services – including supporting new ways to display Reddit content and providing more efficient ways to train models.**

From [Google's announcement](https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/expanded-reddit-partnership/):

>**Over the years, we’ve** [seen](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=reddit&hl=en) **that people increasingly use Google to search for helpful content on Reddit** to find product recommendations, travel advice and much more. We know [people find this information useful](https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-perspectives/), so we’re developing ways to make it even easier to access across Google products. **This partnership will facilitate more content-forward displays of Reddit information that will make our products more helpful for our users** and make it easier to participate in Reddit communities and conversations.

To summarize, the deal between Reddit and Google was never limited to a payment of $15M per quarter in exchange for access to Reddit's data API. It also included a commitment from Google to make it ""easier to access"" Reddit data across Google products. They have been executing on that deal every quarter since the partnership started.

**Google added over 20M new daily active users to Reddit as of Q2 2024**

They are on track for 30M by Q4 2024. This corresponds to a 50% increase in Reddit's total user base exclusively from increased Google visibility in about a year.

These calculations are based on several things. I won't get into the nitty gritty but the gist of it is this: you can use a regression on Reddit's user growth data from the quarters leading up to the first Helpful Content Update that benefitted Reddit starting in July 2023. You can then diff those predicted numbers with the actual user counts to arrive at the difference in users caused by Google's search engine changes.

\[Go to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/1f86raz/reddits_partnership_with_google_is_worth_closer/) and scroll down to see a chart of this. Not able add more than 1 attachment atm.\]

The data point for September 2024 uses Semrush's Organic Keyword count for [reddit.com](http://reddit.com/) to predict the increase in daily active users. As it turns out, the Organic Keyword count metric has the strongest relationship with changes in logged out and logged in daily active users with R-squared values of 0.991 and 0.971.

Assuming that Reddit will appear in the top results for 365M organic keywords by end of Q3 2024 (which is where its current value for that metric stands as of 9/2/2024), you get the following predictions:

* **Predicted Logged-Out Users**: 54,780,763
* **Predicted Logged-In Users**: 43,504,706

https://preview.redd.it/fyygxtnobnmd1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=8565321f6dd9d62f73e9fed47a4cfcdbdaf1073b

Visually, this prediction looks correct when plotted against the rest of their daily active user data.

If you make an assumption that Logged Out users are monetizing at an ARPU of $1.20 per logged out user and $3 per logged in user (which seems reasonable and potentially conservative), you get the stacked chart shown at the bottom of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/1f86raz/reddits_partnership_with_google_is_worth_closer/) showing upwards of $58 million Google-delivered dollars in Q3 2024.

**Achieving Profitability**

The predicted user counts above reinforce Reddit's Q3 revenue guidance which was $290M - $310M. The predicted user counts come out to roughly $303M for Q3 quarterly revenue which is almost smack dab in the middle of Reddit's guidance.

Conspicuously, they provided that guidance in the middle of Google's July and August core updates which added quite a bit to Reddit's Organic Traffic and Organic Keyword metrics. This suggests that Reddit was potentially anticipating this increase.

On a recent podcast, Steve (CEO) mentioned how happy he was that Reddit was able to scale revenue by 50% per quarter (YoY) while keeping head count fixed. In Q2, expenses came out to about $313M for SGNA, R&D, and CoR. If expenses for Q3 come in close to expenses for Q2, or perhaps something a few percentage points higher, they'll just about break even for the first time ever.

The fourth quarter tends to be higher than the rest of the prior year. Assuming no additional visibility increases by Google and assuming the typical seasonal increase arrives on time, Q4 could be the first time where Reddit meaningfully achieves profitability on a GAAP basis. I believe I calculated $42 million left over assuming revenue of $360M and a 3% quarterly increase in SGNA/R&D/CoR.

Read up on it and I am converted, I'll maybe make a sizeable bet of like 10% but I ain't going all in (at that point it's basically a hedge).

The gist is the best way to make money over time is to sensibly size your capital allocation to any bet you make, statistically you will come out better off. Even if a bet has a 99% chance of doubling your investment it doesn't make sense to bet your entire port because if you hit that 1% you're fucked. Think of it as playing Russian Roulette with a revolver with 100 barrels (YOLOing), vs.... I don't know, some equivalent situation but if the bet doesn't go your way you just get punched in the face really hard (sizeable allocation but not a YOLO). Not even accounting for the fact most of this shit has odds sub 10%, not to mention you probably don't understand options correctly and will lose even if what you think will happen to the underlying happens.

If you bet 10% on something that moons, you made great gains! Enviable gains even. Don't risk having to leave the table entirely and impacting your future because you FOMO your entire port on something.

Central to their argument is that Microsoft's licensing terms for its dominant products (Windows Server, Microsoft Office, etc.) ""lock in"" clients to using their Azure cloud service, making it difficult for them to switch to other providers.

Google states that these practices force European businesses to pay up to €1 billion annually in licensing penalties to move their workloads to other cloud services. This claim is supported by a 2023 study from CISPE, a cloud computing industry group. Google criticizes these practices as harmful to cybersecurity and innovation.

Microsoft reached a settlement in July with CISPE members to alter its practices. They responded to Google's complaint by pointing to their previous settlement as a resolution of similar issues.

Google, not a member of CISPE and having opted out of the July settlement, continues to press for changes that would allow more freedom for customers to choose their preferred cloud provider without facing restrictive costs or penalties.

Hello,

With the rise of generative AI, more and more people are using it instead of searching on Google. Gemini falls short compared to its competitors, and it seems that Google is much further behind in the AI race than it appeared to be a year ago.

Furthermore, AI-powered engines are emerging, and they are already working well today. Take Perplexity, for example: it is a well-functioning product, and it can only improve in the coming months.

Also, OpenAI is about to launch its own search engine.

In addition, Google’s results are filled with AI-written articles of little value that rank on the first page but shouldn’t even be in the top positions.

Google is losing searches and impressions on AdSense because people are tired of ad-filled blogs with terrible user experience. Gemini is not on the same level as Claude or GPT.

I don’t understand why people think Google’s stock is a bargain. To me, it’s a fallen giant.

TL;DR: Google is falling behind in the AI race, with competitors like Perplexity and OpenAI leading the way. Its search results are filled with low-quality AI-written content, and users are moving away from it."
2024-10-10 08:01:47,whiskyrookie,If Google breaks up into multiple companies is that a good thing?,"The DOJ is seriously considering breaking up Google as a potential option.

If that happens, for existing shareholders, is that a good thing in the long run?

YouTube alone is a multibillion dollar company."
2024-10-11 07:19:31,SpaceChad_87,"GOOGLE: The Real Leader In AI, Robotics and Self Driving ","This is a follow up  post to my analysis of TESLA VS WAYMO. 


Right now OpenAI is the clear leader when it comes to developing AI. Everyone else is playing catch up, however there's one company that doesn't get enough credit - GOOGLE. 


Google is the one that actually did most of the groundbreaking work in AI. They're the pioneers of technology in the field of AI. 


You must be thinking Why didn't we hear about this if they're the pioneers of AI? 


The reason is that Google failed to be the first one to commercialise it. 

Google had something called ""PROJECT MOONSHOTS.""  It was basically a division of Google solely focused on Ultra Ambitious Projects. 

AI research and development was a part of it.

In 2014 Google acquired DeepMind Labs that was founded in the UK in 2010.

DeepMind introduced neural Turing machines (neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine), which is basically a computer that loosely resembles short-term memory in the human brain.


The Founding Research and Development Team of OpenAI, actually came from Google (DeepMind).


Now going back to ""PROJECT MOONSHOTS"" - in 2010 Larry Page and Sergy Brin turned  ""Project Moonshots"" into ""X COMPANY"".

Yes, it's called X, and they did it before Musk LMAO. 

This is what X Company does -

X's mission is to invent and launch ""moonshot"" technologies that aim to make the world a radically better place.

 A moonshot is defined by X as the intersection of a big problem, a radical solution, and breakthrough technology. 

Work at X is overseen by entrepreneur scientist Astro Teller, as CEO and ""Captain of Moonshots"".

The lab started with the development of Google's self-driving car.


SELF DRIVING VEHICLES are a brainchild of X Company. 

They are also working on some secret projects (presumably alongside the US government).


While Google fell behind OpenAI in commercializing and marketing of AI, they are still a leader in everything related to AI, Machine Learning and Fully Autonomous Vehicles. 


. . . . . . .


TLDR;

GOOGLE IS EVERYTHING ELON MUSK IS CLAIMING TO BE. 



. . . . . 


EDIT 1 : My Thoughts On DOJ Case Against Google and A Potential Breakup 


If (a big if) DOJ actually wins against Google and is able to break them up, the most likely scenario is a spin-off of Android and Chrome. 

IMO, this is not a bad thing if you're looking at the bigger picture. It will get DOJ/Anti-trust lawsuits worldwide off Google's back, without really impairing their ability to develop AI and other futuristic tech.


Even this can potentially take years to materialize, if it ever actually happens. So personally I'm not bothered by it.

2024-10-16 08:00:11,One-Hovercraft-1935,Get in on Uranium Now,"**Since 2020, the price of uranium has gone from $21/lb to a high of $106/lb in Feb 2024. The price has experienced a slight pull back since then to $83/lb. I believe this 4-5x change in the price of uranium to be small compared to what lies ahead, and I will explain the reasons why in this paper.** 

**What is Uranium?**

Uranium is an abundant, radioactive metal naturally occurring in earth's crust. The vast purpose of it today is used for creating nuclear fuel to provide energy. It is one of the cleanest burning fuels and very easy on the environment. Think of Uranium as a gas pump, there are different options you can choose between based on grade. We will focus on the two main isotopes for Uranium. When it is mined, approximately 99.3% is uranium-238 and 0.7% is uranium-235.

U-238 is a critical component of plutonium production which in itself gives a TON of demand. The major application of Uranium in the military sector is depleted Uranium (DU). DU is mostly U-238 after U-235 has been removed. It is used to create armor piercing rounds and military projectiles. The high density of DU makes weapons highly effective. There are other important uses of U-238, such as counterbalancing aircraft, though we are not focusing on those.

U-235 is even more important because for the most part, this is what fuels nuclear reactors. In order to power a nuclear reactor, the concentration of U-235 needs to be 3-5% instead of 0.7%. The higher concentration makes it fissionable, meaning it can power light-water reactors which are the most common reactor design in the USA (United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission). One kilogram (2.2 LBS) of U-235 produces as much energy as 3,306,930 pounds of coal.

**HALEU**

High-assay low-enriched uranium. A crucial material needed to deploy advanced nuclear reactors. Currently, HALEU is not commercially available from US based suppliers. Boosting domestic supply could spur the development of advanced reactors in the US (Energy.gov). In November, the DOE reached a key milestone under its HALEU demonstration project, when a company produced the nation’s first 20 kilograms of HALEU. Thus, providing a first of its kind production in the United States in more than 70 years. Amid growing efforts to secure a reliable domestic nuclear fuel supply, the DOE has awarded contracts to six companies as part of an $800 million initiative to bolster the deconversion of high-assay low-enriched uranium (Roan, 2024).

The existing fleet of US reactors run on enriched uranium up to 5% with U-235. However, most advanced reactors require HALEU which is enriched between 5% to 20% in order to achieve smaller and more versatile designs with the highest standards of safety, security and nonproliferation. HALEU also allows developers to optimize their systems for longer life cores, increased efficiencies, and better fuel utilization. Together, the US, Canada, France, Japan and the UK have announced collective plans to mobilize $4.2 billion in government-led spending to develop safe and secure nuclear energy supply chains (Energy.gov). 

As we now know, enriched uranium is crucial. Although, the enrichment process is very costly. Russia is the biggest player in the enrichment process. They are responsible for roughly 44% of the world’s enrichment capacity and supply approximately 35% of imported nuclear fuel to the US. As of August 12th, 2024, Uranium imports into the USA from Russia are outlawed. This allows $2.7 billion in funding to build out the U.S uranium industry specifically, to increase production of LEU and HALEU. The DOE estimates that US utilities have roughly 3 years of LEU available through existing inventory or pre-existing contracts. To ensure no plants are disrupted, a waiver process is in order to allow some imports of LEU from Russia to continue for a limited time. “In the meantime, we’re taking aggressive steps to establish a secure and reliable uranium supply market” (Energy.gov). 

**Uranium Supply**

Now, the supply that was once held of uranium is running out. “The inventory overhang that was so damaging to the market for almost a decade has been largely consumed, and going forward, we’re going to have an increasing reliance on primary supply” (World Nuclear News). Idled mines are now starting production again, as well as increases in mines under development, and planned mines. “There is no doubt that sufficient uranium resources exist to meet future needs, but producers have been waiting for the market to rebalance before starting to invest in new capacity and bring idled capacity back into operation. This is now happening (World Nuclear News).

The uranium market has been facing a supply deficit for years due to underinvestment. The problem is that uranium mines take a long time and require a ton of capital to get up and running. A mine can take 10-15 years to begin production AFTER they are opened. 

As with other minerals, investment in geological exploration generally results in increased known resources. Over 2005 and 2006, exploration efforts resulted in the world’s known uranium resources increasing by 15% (World Nuclear Association). Therefore, there is no need to anticipate any uranium shortage.The world’s current measured resources of uranium will last about 90 years. This represents a higher level of assured resources than is normal for most minerals. There is nearly limitless supply because most of it has not been discovered due to little investment in mining and exploration. To be clear, although we know this uranium exists, that does not mean it has been mined. 

Primary Supply - This type of supply refers to uranium extracted directly from mining.The primary supply has been under heavy pressure in recent years due to low uranium prices. Low prices lead to reduced mining operations. This is because mining is incredibly expensive and companies won’t do it if there is no good price incentive at which they could sell the uranium. It is forecasted that uranium mining will not meet the reactor demands for at least 15 years. Now, it is also estimated that by 2035, primary uranium production will decrease by 30% due to resource depletion and mine closures. New mines will only be able to compensate for the capacity of the exhausted mines.

Secondary Supply - This refers to all uranium that is not sourced directly from mining but from other inventories and recycled materials. This includes, civil stockpiles, military stockpiles, recycled uranium and enrichment tails. Civil stockpiles (uranium reserves held by utilities, hedge funds, and government) grew immensely after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Many reactors shut down due to the worries surrounding uranium, and investment in the nuclear sector decreased. Due to this, there was a large oversupply of uranium. Since then, these stockpiles have been largely drawn upon to meet reactor demand, instead of relying on primary supply. So, utilities have been relying on their inventory to fuel their reactors, instead of getting fresh uranium from mines. This has caused a gradual depletion of their reserves. There is no mathematical way to rely on reserves anymore. The ONLY option is to produce uranium in order to keep reactors operational, while meeting future demand.

**Uranium Demand** 

The United States, China, and France represent around 58% of global uranium demand. Uranium demand can be characterized as a predictable function of the number of operating nuclear power plants, their capacity factors and fuel burn up levels. As of April 30th, 2024, there are 94 operating nuclear reactors in the United States. The global count of operating nuclear reactors is 440. These account for 9% of the world's electricity. Currently, there are 60 nuclear reactors in production across 16 countries spanning into 2030. About 90 more reactors have been planned and over 300 have been proposed. 

Looking ten years ahead, the uranium market is expected to grow. The 2023 World Nuclear Association’s Nuclear Fuel Report shows a 28% increase in uranium demand over 2023-2030. This same report predicts a 51% increase in uranium demand for the decade 2031-2040. Global demand for electricity may rise 165% by 2050 while at the same time, 101 countries have committed to net-zero carbon emission goals and are actively pursuing a shift to clean energy.

**Global Price of Uranium Last 25 Years (USD/Lbs)**

**Uranium Production**

The main producers of uranium are Kazakhstan, Canada, Namibia, Australia, and Uzbekistan. Kazakhstan is the major producer. In 2022, they produced 43% of the world’s uranium. The company Kazatomprom is responsible for the massive production within the country. Very big news came out recently stating they have slashed their production target for 2025 by 17%. This is due to project delays and sulfuric acid shortages (a critical component of uranium extraction). They are expected to produce 25,000-26,500 tonnes of yellowcake (a concentrated form of uranium ore produced during the early stage of processing).This move is likely to continue the upward pressure on uranium prices. This slash in production is occurring while Kazatomprom has their lowest reported uranium inventory levels since 1997 of 4,142 tonnes of uranium, down 31% from the previous year (Dempsey, 2024). “This is a structural problem. It won’t just be the west saying this is an issue for us; it will also be Russia and China saying it’s a problem for our new nuclear power plants” (Nick Lawson, CEO of Ocean Wall). 

Uranium prices have been low for decades due to oversupply and stockpiles. This has made it less appealing to develop new mines and instead, rely on existing mines and supply. However, the US and other countries are showing increased signs of uranium mining at an alarming rate. In the first quarter of 2024, the United States produced more than 82,000 LBS of uranium which is more than the entire 2023 production. In Q2 of  2024, production increased to 97,709 LBS, an 18% increase from Q1 2024. While this increased production is significant for a domestic supply, it does not begin to put a dent in the global deficit. It simply goes to show the US is beginning their own production of uranium.

**United States Uranium Production 2000-2024 Q2 lbs**

In a recent interview with Justin Huhn, a uranium market expert, he stated, “YTD there has been 54 million pounds contracted. Demand pulled back temporarily and when that happened, price kept rising. It's a hugely important indicator that when demand comes back in, which it is starting to, the prices are going higher. We're starting to see early signs of that. Honestly, I think we are on the cusp of a very large movement in the coming weeks. We're going to see a competitive environment for limited supply. That's what is coming next. The ceiling in the contracts tells you where the price is going. The 3 and 5 year forward tells you where the spot is going. Every piece of evidence in the physical market is telling us that prices are going higher.""

""Companies need uranium and they aren't going to not buy it at price xyz. Now, could we get to a point where logically the price of uranium utility does not justify continued operations? That's possible. And unless we have a balanced market, that might be the limiting upside factor. Price would have to be somewhere in the $700s for the average utility to not afford to buy uranium in order to operate their facilities.”

**World Uranium Production vs Reactor Requirements, 1945-2022 tU**

# Conclusion 

Although we’ve seen drastic changes in the price of uranium already, I believe the bull market is just beginning. There is immense demand, and production simply can’t meet the requirements. Prospective mines can take 10-15 years to become operational, while 30% of current mines are estimated to be depleted by 2035. There is not enough time available for the uranium supply to meet the demand despite increases in production. Companies are willing and obligated to secure nuclear fuel at almost any price. Increased investment into nuclear energy is happening from a governmental side and big tech. Amazon, Microsoft and Google have all come out with news recently, investing insane amounts into nuclear. Countries are uniting in the fight against climate change to establish a global supply of clean, zero-carbon energy. Therefore, I believe that as the supply continues to dwindle and demand continues to increase, the fight for uranium that will ensue is going to send the price to levels we have never before seen in history. 

**Investment Ideas**

I think mining companies are best set up to gain from this market. A high uranium price means they earn higher revenues by selling it. This also allows them to further develop mines and explore new areas, increasing overall production. We are in a seller dominated market where prices are based on bidding wars between utilities, governments, and hedge funds. These mining companies are Cameco (CCJ) currently trading at $50.86 and NexGen Energy (NXE) trading at $7.26. I also like the mining ETF Range Nuclear Renaissance Index (NUKZ) trading at $38.31 and Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM) trading at $48.26. The other companies I like in this sector are Clean Harbors, Inc. trading at $257.48 and Constellation Energy (CEG) trading at $265.86. Clean Harbors has a dominant position in the market for the handling and disposal of nuclear waste. They also have very good management. I’d say they are my favorite pick out of the entire sector. Aware that this is WSB, YOLO calls on URNM is the play. This is a chance to create generational wealth.

2024-10-25 13:17:24,OSRSkarma,Weekly Earnings thread 10/28 - 11/1,
2024-10-26 17:11:05,coop-dog7,My 100x companies 🤜📈,"First off, for a company to potentially 100x, it has to be truly revolutionary to the point where no one believes in it. And that is what I love. I have mentioned a few of these in previous posts (my largest being IONQ) and got shit on for it. Since that post, it has doubled (177 days). Whether you agree or not, this post is mostly a way for me to combine my research and give others opportunities. Remember you can only lose 100% but make infinite. I don’t expect anyone to believe in these stocks now, but check back in 5 years. 



So with that, 



Company number 1: **IONQ**. (I have made this post before but my confidence is so strong in IONQ that others need to hear it again)



IONQ is a company in the quantum computing industry and the reason I’m bullish on it is due to its positioning in the quantum industry. Unlike other companies such as IBM, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN and others, IONQ is able to create incredibly accurate qubits. 



What is quantum computing and qubits?



Quantum computing utilizes qubits rather than the conventional bits in computing to solve the most complex problems. A bit is the binary value of 1 or 0 that stores data. Qubits by themselves are not interesting but that data it holds can be held in a state of superposition. This allows the qubit to be in a way, in every possible form. Once groups of these are in superposition, that data is in multidimensional space. That may sound complicated but imagine a normal computer has its bits in 2d space whereas quantum computing pushes that to the 3rd or 4th dimension allowing the data to be in every configuration. That’s just a basic quantum computer. Now to actually use these computers and qubits to solve complex problems, you must fire microwaves photons at them. The photons essentially tell it what position to be in. To change shape and read the info from that new position. 



What does IONQ do that’s special?



Well IONQ has made incredibly accurate and stable qubits. Nature has created natural quantum systems in atoms that IONQ has been able to ionize and isolate. Because of that IONQ uses the naturally occurring quantum systems to create their qubits. 



Other companies such as IBM have revolutionized other areas of computing. IBM has used their chips to improve error correction of output data. GOOG is maximizing the number of qubits. AMZN also focused on error correction and the overall accuracy of its computing. MSFT focuses on quantum algorithms. Basically no other company has been able to produce and scale accurate qubits. (This is different than IBM because IBM needs the tech to limit errors whereas IONQ’s qubits practically have no errors to begin with)



Why quantum computing could be the future.



1: Quantum computing has the potential to simply solve exponentially more challenging problems at a much faster rate. This will be used in our everyday life from shipping routes to electric vehicle batteries development. Any problem can be solved quicker and more accurately.  

2: Quantum computing currently sits at an industry value of around 600 million with expectation for 9 billion in 2030. That’s the compounded annual growth so a breakthrough could yield a much higher potential industry value

3: IONQ has investors including Kia, Google, Fidelity, Hyundai, and a couple firms. As well as being partnered with Amazon. Its investors stemming from automobiles to banking shows the belief in the possibilities of quantum computing. 

4: Quantum computers are just cool. They sound cool, they look cool, and who doesn’t love cool. If you haven’t seen one I highly recommend looking it up. 







Company number 2: **NuScale Power Corp (SMR)** 



We are just beginning to understand and even implement the extensive uses of nuclear energy. We are reaching undeniably dangerous levels of climate change due to constant greenhouse emissions due to growing populations, economies, and countries. Now these emissions come from producing out necessities which first stem from energy. Energy is everything. Everyone knows fossil fuels are simply bad for the environment but to what extent? Well to the extent that if we want humankind to live over 50 more years, we NEED to limit these emissions. And that is where nuclear energy comes in. Nuclear energy releases nearly zero emissions yet is roughly 8000 times more efficient than fossil fuels. So that begs the question, why don’t we solely use nuclear energy? It was unstable and unfeasible to main stream it. Until now.



SMR is in the works of finalizing and streamlining its small modular reactors. Previously power plants required large plots of land, large mantience crews, and came with high risks of meltdown and the effects that come with that. However, SMR has cut down every single one of those factors. 



Now why would you invest in futuristic nuclear fission without understanding it. Well here is is simply put if you have taken a high school chemistry course. A neutron is released into a stable collection of uranium atoms which when collide and produce extreme amounts of energy taking the form of heat. Once one uranium atom splits, it releases more neutrons creating a chain reaction. This heat is then pressurized into steam which is used to create power. Now SMR submerges their reactors in water to provide consistent coolant during the reaction further within a room lined with seismic category 1 aircraft impact resistant structures. Now they also employ many more safety protocols to minimize the chance of a nuclear meltdown and the reaction of that to nearly zero.



So, why is nuclear energy and SMR simply creating the future?



1: We will NEED nuclear energy if we want to continue to grow as a species without killing the climate and ourself

2: SMR has innovated a way to scale nuclear power plants to make them economically viable for everyone and for our main supplier of power. 

3: SMR has large investors including Google, Amazon, potentially Microsoft, and I’m sure many more (no other investors were public information). 



Also, a similar stock to SMR that I’m also investing in is OKLO. They are similar to SMR just appear to be in the earlier stages of entering the nuclear energy market (which I love). 







Company number 3: **AST SpaceMobile (ASTS)**



Im sure you have heard of ASTS through this subreddit, and probably think you already missed your chance ton invest. But that couldn’t be further from the truth. 



ASTS is a company building the first ever global cellular network in space that allows 4G/5G connection from anywhere in the world, with any cellular phone. How awesome does that sound. 5G coverage while at sea, in a plane, in the middle of the andes. Anywhere you could think, boom connection. Now their stock is up a ton recently for only having launched 5 satellites. 



Once again cellular coverage can be a complicated concept for some, so here it is simply put. As of now, with whoever your cellar provider is, (AT&T, Verizon, TMobile) Im sure you lose coverage while driving in the middle of nowhere, on flights, and sometimes in populated areas you would never expect. And it’s only when you need connection that you realize you have no connection. So ASTS would fully eliminate this problem for anyone in the WORLD that owns a cellular phone and is connected with ASTS. The cellular market value sits at around 450 billion dollars. That’s 450,000,000,000. Nearly completely devastated if ASTS can do what it says. 



That being said, them being able to provide coverage anywhere in the world is a long shot. But that’s why I love it. They have already received FCC permission to complete the launch of 5 satellite which turned out successful. With their hefty goal in mind that would take over an entire sector, they have a bright road ahead of them all mapped out, just waiting for asphalt. 



So, why is ASTS the future?



1: They can provide cellular coverage ANYWHERE in the world from ANY cellular phone. And we already know how reliant our world is on electronics

2: They have successfully launched 5 satellites and in the works of creating their arsenal in space

3: If they are successful, they would take over a nearly 450 billion dollar sector and own a monopoly on cellular coverage. 

4: they have strong investors including they major partner AT&T, Google, Vodafone, and more







So anyways, that’s just my two sense of stocks I see making people fortunes. But I’m just a teenager with no degree in quantum computing, nuclear fusion, or cellular communications so take it with a grain of salt. 



Positions: Nearly 16k spread throughout these 3 companies and constantly increasing.

2024-11-02 08:17:45,Kazgarth_,Why I think TSM/INTC will outpace NVDA/AMD growth in the next decade. ,"Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are spending billions of CapEx on AI. Lets just look at their last 2 quarters spending:

* **Amazon**: Increased CapEx from $60 billion in Q2 2024 to $70 billion in Q3 2024.
* **Google**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion in the same period.
* **Microsoft**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion.
* **Meta**: Increased CapEx from $29 billion to $31 billion.

However not all that CapEx is going to third party AI solutions like Nvidia/AMD. Each and every company listed above has or is developing it's own custom AI silicon.

Lets look how they are transitioning from 3rd party to In-House AI silicon:

**Amazon**: Developed AWS Inferentia and Tranium chips for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Google**: Developed Tensor Processing Unite (TPU) and Axion chip for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

**Microsoft**: Developed Azure Maia AI chip and Azure Cobalt for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Meta**: Developed Meta trading and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

All those developments reduce dependence on external GPU suppliers, allow more customized/efficient AI processing and most importantly huge cost savings.

Just to understand the level of savings (and why would they invest huge R&D budget on this):

A **regular Nvidia H100 GPU**, cost approximately **$3,320** to manufacture from TSMC. However it is being sold at **$25,000 to $30,000** each!

That's almost 800%-900% profit margins that has to be paid by the companies above, when they opt not to choose In-House Silicon.

As more of the AI CapEx goes to custom silicon (will never be 100%, but expect that percentage only to grow larger over time, driven by cost savings)  TSMC and Intel foundries will benefit directly from this trend (both have EUV capabilities, INTC will mass produce 18A EUV chips next year, with Amazon as first client)

And this will position TSMC and INTC for substantial growth, because **the rate limiting factor for AI growth will be how much silicon can TSMC or INTC manufacture** for the entire world's AI demand.
