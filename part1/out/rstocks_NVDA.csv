2017-05-09 14:57:06,Jcart665,NVDA EARNINGS UPVOTE PARTY,14% AFTER MARKET FUCK YES. TIME TO BREAK 120 
2017-06-08 11:31:00,kinetico213,"Thanks to $NVDA and $AMD, I've finally reached my goal today! :)","http://i.imgur.com/wbCKxo5.png

My main goal has always been to reach $10,000 bar and today, I'm here to say that I've finally managed to pull that off within 1 yr and 9 months of trading.



I've been investing here and there but the main source of this success was two tech monsters: $NVDA and $AMD.
(My very first trade with $AMD was when it was $2.86 per share and $NVDA with $33.) 


Come to think of it, I would have made way more money if I've put 100% of my portfolio into these two but I can't be complaining with what I've already made as a beginner. (I've invested into $DIS, $ATVI, $BABA, $MSFT and more with the two.) 



Though I strongly believe $NVDA and $AMD have more rooms to go north, I'm going to cash everything out and take the profit for now (I'm going to pay out my loan with it.) Half of the profit came from the stocks that I've bought along the way which I'm probably gonna get hit by that 25% tax rate but profit is still a profit I guess :)



Setting everything aside, it feels great to reach my goal!!!   "
2018-07-12 21:44:59,ResistantOlive,NVDA (and possibly AMD) is screwed for Q2 Earnings,"First off, we all love NVDA and it's an amazing meme stock.  A lot of us have made countless amounts of money off of these guys.  But for Q2 earnings they're fucked.

1: Take a look at these [GPU price graphs](https://pcpartpicker.com/trends/price/video-card/).  The trend is a huge peak and slow fall, but all of this happened before Q1 earnings, meaning their large beat in may was heavily influenced by this.  Since the beginning of february GPU prices are 30% lower.  Due to the law of supply and demand, this means that the supply was too high and the demand fell - meaning NVDA lost money on a lot of these cards.  A price drop at this scale means a large excess of inventory - i'll get to that later.

2: Cryptocurrency fad is dead for the time being.  The following is a quote from their CFO about cryptocurrency (which NVDA does not like to talk about):
> “Cryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected, but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto-specific GPUs, which are included in our OEM business at $289 million,” Kress said. “Looking into Q2, we expect crypto-specific revenue to be about one-third of its Q1 level.”

Since Nvidia's total revenue was [$3.207 billion](https://s22.q4cdn.com/364334381/files/doc_financials/quarterly_reports/2019/NVIDIA-Q1Y19-Form-10Q.pdf) in the first quarter, this means a 7% drop in revenue Q/Q due to only cryptocurrency.

3: [Gigabyte, a company which makes NVDA cards saw their revenue fall 30% in june.](http://emops.twse.com.tw/server-java/t05st10_e?TYPEK=sii&step=show&co_id=2376&year=2018&month=06) This is the most direct evidence revenues are going to massively fall, as this was right when graphics cards saw a huge price drop.  

4: [Allegedly there was an OEM who returned 300,000 GPUs back to Nvidia.](https://wccftech.com/nvidia-oem-partner-300k-gpu-inventory-issues-next-gen-geforce-delay/)  If this is true that is around $150 million in revenue lost assuming an average price of $400 per card (really rough estimate).  That's another 7% meaning these two things combined could show a 14% loss in revenue Q/Q.  This shows another instance of inventory mismanagement on NVDA's part.

All in all NVDA could see a large drop in earnings.  Due to the nature of this stock, however, there's no telling if it actually goes down after earnings.  If AMD earnings come out bad that will prove some of these points and give you a warning as to what NVDA earnings hold, so I suggest watching AMD if you will play NVDA.

-

TL;DR: NVDA made too many cards cause of crypto or something else, GPU prices are down, and their earnings are fucked."
2018-10-26 12:09:13,abeecrombie,"Semiconductor stocks - understand the cycle. MU, NVDA, TXN, AMAT, SOX"," 

I though I would write a short post for some of the youngins here who have never experienced a real correction or know what a market cycle is.

1. The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful
2. Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad. For months there have been signs that the semi cycle is topping out. Suppliers like LAM and AMAT topped out a while ago as demand is slowing. And then you had KLAC at a conference a few weeks ago talking about order growth slowing and then TXN finally confirmed that we are in a semi slowdown. Why? Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS. They will keep spending but I would expect the market to be more prepared now.

The good thing about the semi cycle nowadays is that there is a lot more demand than just PC's or smartphones. So eventually it will come back. And IMO we are probably half way through it already. Asian semi's and suppliers got the message a long time ago. Look to them for the first signs of a bottom.

Happy trading"

2020-05-17 13:52:55,HyperInflation2020,NVidia – Know What You Own,"How many people really understand what they’re buying, especially when it comes to highly specialized hardware companies? Most NVidia investors seem to be relying on a vague idea of how the company should thrive “in the future”, as their GPUs are ostensibly used for Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, holograms, etc. Having been shocked by how this company is represented in the media, I decided to lay out how this business works, doing my part to fight for reality. With what’s been going on in markets, I don’t like my chances but here goes:

Let’s start with…

**How does NVDA make money?**

NVDA is in the business of semiconductor design. As a simplified image in your head, you can imagine this as designing very detailed and elaborate posters. Their engineers create circuit patterns for printing onto semiconductor wafers. NVDA then pays a semiconductor foundry (the printer – generally TSMC) to create chips with those patterns on them.

Simply put, NVDA’s profits represent the difference between the price at which they can sell those chips, less the cost of printing, and less the cost of paying their engineers to design them.

Notably, after the foundry prints the chips, NVDA also has to pay (I say pay, but really it is more like “sell at a discount to”) their “add-in board” (AIB) partners to stick the chips onto printed circuit boards (what you might imagine as green things with a bunch of capacitors on them). That leads to the final form in which buyers experience the GPU.

**What is a GPU?**

NVDA designs chips called GPUs (Graphical Processing Units). Initially, GPUs were used for the rapid processing and creation of images, but their use cases have expanded over time. You may be familiar with the CPU (Central Processing Unit). CPUs sit at the core of a computer system, doing most of the calculation, taking orders from the operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux), etc. AMD and Intel make CPUs. GPUs assist the CPU with certain tasks. You can think of the CPU as having a few giant very powerful engines. The GPU has a lot of small much less powerful engines. Sometimes you have to do a lot of really simple tasks that don’t require powerful engines to complete. Here, the act of engaging the powerful engines is a waste of time, as you end up spending most of your time revving them up and revving them down. In that scenario, it helps the CPU to hand that task over to the GPU in order to “accelerate” the completion of the task. The GPU only revs up a small engine for each task, and is able to rev up all the small engines simultaneously to knock out a large number of these simple tasks at the same time. Remember the GPU has lots of engines. The GPU also has an edge in interfacing a lot with memory but let’s not get too technical.

**Who uses NVDA’s GPUs?**

There are two main broad end markets for NVDA’s GPUs – Gaming and Professional. Let’s dig into each one:

**The Gaming Market:**

A Bit of Ancient History (**Skip if impatient**)

GPUs were first heavily used for gaming in arcades. They then made their way to consoles, and finally PCs. NVDA started out in the PC phase of GPU gaming usage. They weren’t the first company in the space, but they made several good moves that ultimately led to a very strong market position. Firstly, they focused on selling into OEMs – guys like the equivalent of today’s DELL/HP/Lenovo – , which allowed a small company to get access to a big market without having to create a lot of relationships. Secondly, they focused on the design aspect of the GPU, and relied on their Asian supply chain to print the chip, to package the chip and to install in on a printed circuit board – the Asian supply chain ended up being the best in semis. But the insight that really let NVDA dominate was noticing that some GPU manufacturers were focusing on keeping hardware-accelerated Transform and Lighting as a Professional GPU feature. As a start-up, with no professional GPU business to disrupt, NVidia decided their best ticket into the big leagues was blowing up the market by including this professional grade feature into their gaming product. It worked – and this was a real masterstroke – the visual and performance improvements were extraordinary. 3DFX, the initial leader in PC gaming GPUs, was vanquished, and importantly it happened when funding markets shut down with the tech bubble bursting and after 3DFX made some large ill-advised acquisitions. Consequently 3DFX, went from hero to zero, and NVDA bought them for a pittance out of bankruptcy, acquiring the best IP portfolio in the industry.

**Some more Modern History**

This is what NVDA’s pure gaming card revenue looks like over time – NVDA only really broke these out in 2005 (note by pure, this means ex-Tegra revenues):

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr\_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno)

So what is the history here? Well, back in the late 90s when GPUs were first invented, they were **required** to play any 3D game. As discussed in the early history above, NVDA landed a hit product to start with early and got a strong burst of growth: revenues of 160M in 1998 went to 1900M in 2002. But then NVDA ran into strong competition from ATI (later purchased and currently owned by AMD). While NVDA’s sales struggled to stay flat from 2002 to 2004, ATI’s doubled from 1Bn to 2Bn. NVDA’s next major win came in 2006, with the 8000 series. ATI was late with a competing product, and NVDA’s sales skyrocketed – as can be seen in the graph above. With ATI being acquired by AMD they were unfocused for some time, and NVDA was able to keep their lead for an extended period. Sales slowed in 2008/2009 but that was due to the GFC – people don’t buy expensive GPU hardware in recessions.

And then we got to 2010 and the tide changed. Growth in desktop PCs ended. Here is a chart from Statista:

📷[https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr\_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9)

This resulted in two negative secular trends for Nvidia. Firstly, with the decline in popularity of desktop PCs, growth in gaming GPUs faded as well (below is a chart from Jon Peddie). Note that NVDA sells discrete GPUs, aka DT (Desktop) Discrete. Integrated GPUs are mainly made by Intel (these sit on the motherboard or with the CPU).

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr\_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h)

You can see from the chart above that discrete desktop GPU sales are fading faster than integrated GPU sales. This is the other secular trend hurting NVDA’s gaming business. Integrated GPUs are getting better and better, taking over a wider range of tasks that were previously the domain of the discrete GPU. Surprisingly, the most popular eSports game of recent times – Fortnite – only requires Intel HD 4000 graphics – an Integrated GPU from 2012!

So at this point you might go back to NVDA’s gaming sales, and ask the question: What happened in 2015? How is NVDA overcoming these secular trends?

The answer consists of a few parts.Firstly, AMD dropped the ball in 2015. As you can see in this chart, sourced from 3DCenter, AMD market share was halved in 2015, due to a particularly poor product line-up:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr\_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd)

Following this, NVDA came out with Pascal in 2016 – a very powerful offering in the mid to high end part of the GPU market. At the same time, AMD was focusing on rebuilding and had no compelling mid or high end offerings. AMD mainly focused on maintaining scale in the very low end. Following that came 2017 and 2018: AMD’s offering was still very poor at the time, but cryptomining drove demand for GPUs to new levels, and AMD’s GPUs were more compelling from a price-performance standpoint for crypto mining initially, perversely leading to AMD gaining share. NVDA quickly remedied that by improving their drivers to better mine crypto, regaining their relative positioning, and profiting in a big way from the crypto boom. Supply that was calibrated to meet gaming demand collided with cryptomining demand and Average Selling Prices of GPUs shot through the roof. Cryptominers bought top of the line GPUs aggressively.

A good way to see changes in crypto demand for GPUs is the mining profitability of Ethereum:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr\_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ)

This leads us to where we are today. 2019 saw gaming revenues drop for NVDA. Where are they likely to head?

The secular trends of falling desktop sales along with falling discrete GPU sales have reasserted themselves, as per the Jon Peddie research above. Cryptomining profitability has collapsed.

AMD has come out with a new architecture, NAVI, and the 5700XT – the first Iteration, competes effectively with NVDA in the mid-high end space on a price/performance basis. This is the first real competition from AMD since 2014.

NVDA can see all these trends, and they tried to respond. Firstly, with volumes clearly declining, and likely with a glut of second-hand GPUs that can make their way to gamers over time from the crypto space, NVDA decided to pursue a price over volume strategy. They released their most expensive set of GPUs by far in the latest Turing series. They added a new feature, Ray Tracing, by leveraging the Tensor Cores they had created for Professional uses, hoping to use that as justification for higher prices (more on this in the section on Professional GPUs). Unfortunately for NVDA, gamers have responded quite poorly to Ray Tracing – it caused performance issues, had poor support, poor adoption, and the visual improvements in most cases are not particularly noticeable or relevant.

The last recession led to gaming revenues falling 30%, despite NVDA being in a very strong position at the time vis-à-vis AMD – this time around their position is quickly slipping and it appears that the recession is going to be bigger. Additionally, the shift away from discrete GPUs in gaming continues.

To make matters worse for NVDA, AMD won the slots in both the New Xbox and the New PlayStation, coming out later this year. The performance of just the AMD GPU in those consoles looks to be competitive with NVidia products that currently retail for more than the entire console is likely to cost. Consider that usually you have to pair that NVidia GPU with a bunch of other expensive hardware. The pricing and margin impact of this console cycle on NVDA is likely to be very substantially negative.

It would be prudent to assume a greater than 30% fall in gaming revenues from the very elevated 2019 levels, with likely secular decline to follow.

**The Professional Market:**

A Bit of Ancient History (again, skip if impatient)

As it turns out, graphical accelerators were first used in the Professional market, long before they were employed for Gaming purposes. The big leader in the space was a company called Silicon Graphics, who sold workstations with custom silicon optimised for graphical processing. Their sales were only $25Mn in 1985, but by 1997 they were doing 3.6Bn in revenue – truly exponential growth. Unfortunately for them, from that point on, discrete GPUs took over, and their highly engineered, customised workstations looked exorbitantly expensive in comparison. Sales sank to 500mn by 2006 and, with no profits in sight, they ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2009. Competition is harsh in the semiconductor industry.

Initially, the Professional market centred on visualisation and design, but it has changed over time. There were a lot of players and lot of nuance, but I am going to focus on more recent times, as they are more relevant to NVidia.

**Some More Modern History**

NVDA’s Professional business started after its gaming business, but we don’t have revenue disclosures that show exactly when it became relevant. This is what we do have – going back to 2005:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394785029472256/tumblr\_fEcYAzdstyh6tqIsI](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394785029472256/tumblr_fEcYAzdstyh6tqIsI)

In the beginning, Professional revenues were focused on the 3D visualisation end of the spectrum, with initial sales going into workstations that were edging out the customised builds made by Silicon Graphics. Fairly quickly, however, GPUs added more and more functionality and started to turn into general parallel data processors rather than being solely optimised towards graphical processing.

As this change took place, people in scientific computing noticed, and started using GPUs to accelerate scientific workloads that involve very parallel computation, such as matrix manipulation. This started at the workstation level, but by 2007 NVDA decided to make a new line-up of Tesla series cards specifically suited to scientific computing. The professional segment now have several points of focus:

1. GPUs used in workstations for things such as CAD graphical processing (Quadro Line)
2. GPUs used in workstations for computational workloads such as running engineering simulations (Quadro Line)
3. GPUs used in workstations for machine learning applications (Quadro line.. but can use gaming cards as well for this)
4. GPUs used by enterprise customers for high performance computing (such as modelling oil wells) (Tesla Line)
5. GPUs used by enterprise customers for machine learning projects (Tesla Line)
6. GPUs used by hyperscalers (mostly for machine learning projects) (Tesla Line)

In more recent times, given the expansion of the Tesla line, NVDA has broken up reporting into Professional Visualisation (Quadro Line) and Datacenter (Tesla Line). Here are the revenue splits since that reporting started:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394798232158208/tumblr\_3AdufrCWUFwLgyQw2](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394798232158208/tumblr_3AdufrCWUFwLgyQw2)

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394810632601600/tumblr\_2jmajktuc0T78Juw7](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394810632601600/tumblr_2jmajktuc0T78Juw7)

It is worth stopping here and thinking about the huge increase in sales delivered by the Tesla line. The reason for this huge boom is the sudden increase in interest in numerical techniques for machine learning. Let’s go on a brief detour here to understand what machine learning is, because a lot of people want to hype it but not many want to tell you what it actually is. I have the misfortune of being very familiar with the industry, which prevented me from buying into the hype. Oops – sometimes it really sucks being educated.

**What is Machine Learning?**

At a very high level, machine learning is all about trying to get some sort of insight out of data. Most of the core techniques used in machine learning were developed a long time ago, in the 1950s and 1960s. The most common machine learning technique, which most people have heard of and may be vaguely familiar with, is called regression analysis. Regression analysis involves fitting a line through a bunch of datapoints. The most common type of regression analysis is called “Ordinary Least Squares” OLS regression, and that type of regression has a “closed form” solution, which means that there is a very simple calculation you can do to fit an OLS regression line to data.

As it happens, fitting a line through points is not only easy to do, it also tends to be the main machine learning technique that people want to use, because it is very intuitive. You can make good sense of what the data is telling you and can understand the machine learning model you are using. Obviously, regression analysis doesn’t require a GPU!

However, there is another consideration in machine learning: if you want to use a regression model, you still need a human to select the data that you want to fit the line through. Also, sometimes the relationship doesn’t look like a line, but rather it might look like a curve. In this case, you need a human to “transform” the data before you fit a line through it in order to make the relationship linear.

So people had another idea here: what if instead of getting a person to select the right data to analyse, and the right model to apply, you could just get a computer to do that? Of course the problem with that is that computers are really stupid. They have no preconceived notion of what data to use or what relationship would make sense, so what they do is TRY EVERYTHING! And everything involves trying a hell of a lot of stuff. And trying a hell of a lot of stuff, most of which is useless garbage, involves a huge amount of computation. People tried this for a while through to the 1980s, decided it was useless, and dropped it… until recently.

What changed? Well we have more data now, and we have a lot more computing power, so we figured lets have another go at it. As it happens, the premier technique for trying a hell of a lot of stuff (99.999% of which is garbage you throw away) is called “Deep Learning”. Deep learning is SUPER computationally intensive, and that computation happens to involve a lot of matrix multiplication. And guess what just happens to have been doing a lot of matrix multiplication? GPUs!

Here is a chart that, for obvious reasons, lines up extremely well with the boom in Tesla GPU sales:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394825774989312/tumblr\_IZ3ayFDB0CsGdYVHW](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394825774989312/tumblr_IZ3ayFDB0CsGdYVHW)

Now we need to realise a few things here. Deep Learning is not some magic silver bullet. There are specific applications where it has proven very useful – primarily areas that have a very large number of very weak relationships between bits of data that sum up into strong relationships. An example of ones of those is Google Translate. On the other hand, in most analytical tasks, it is most useful to have an intuitive understanding of the data and to fit a simple and sensible model to it that is explainable. Deep learning models are not explainable in an intuitive manner. This is not only because they are complicated, but also because their scattershot technique of trying everything leaves a huge amount of garbage inside the model that cancels itself out when calculating the answer, but it is hard to see how it cancels itself out when stepping through it.

Given the quantum of hype on Deep learning and the space in general, many companies are using “Deep Learning”, “Machine Learning” and “AI” as marketing. Not many companies are actually generating significant amounts of tangible value from Deep Learning.

**Back to the Competitive Picture**

**For the Tesla Segment**

So NVDA happened to be in the right place at the right time to benefit from the Deep Learning hype. They happened to have a product ready to go and were able to charge a pretty penny for their product. But what happens as we proceed from here?

Firstly, it looks like the hype from Deep Learning has crested, which is not great from a future demand perspective. Not only that, but we really went from people having no GPUs, to people having GPUs. The next phase is people upgrading their old GPUs. It is much harder to sell an upgrade than to make the first sale.

Not only that, but GPUs are not the ideal manifestation of silicon for Deep Learning. NVDA themselves effectively admitted that with their latest iteration in the Datacentre, called Ampere. High Performance Computing, which was the initial use case for Tesla GPUs, was historically all about double precision floating point calculations (FP64). High precision calculations are required for simulations in aerospace/oil & gas/automotive.

NVDA basically sacrificed HPC and shifted further towards Deep Learning with Ampere, announced last Thursday. The FP64 performance of the A100 (the latest Ampere chip) increased a fairly pedestrian 24% from the V100, increasing from 7.8 to 9.7 TF. Not a surprise that NVDA lost El Capitan to AMD, given this shift away from a focus on HPC. Instead, NVDA jacked up their Tensor Cores (i.e. not the GPU cores) and focused very heavily on FP16 computation (a lot less precise than FP64). As it turns out, FP16 is precise enough for Deep Learning, and NVDA recognises that. The future industry standard is likely to be BFloat 16 – the format pioneered by Google, who lead in Deep Learning. Ampere now does 312 TF of BF16, which compares to the 420 TF of Google’s TPU V3 – Google’s Machine Learning specific processor. Not quite up to the 2018 board from Google, but getting better – if they cut out all of the Cuda cores and GPU functionality maybe they could get up to Google’s spec.

And indeed this is the problem for NVDA: when you make a GPU it has a large number of different use cases, and you provide a single product that meets all of these different use cases. That is a very hard thing to do, and explains why it has been difficult for competitors to muscle into the GPU space. On the other hand, when you are making a device that does one thing, such as deep learning, it is a much simpler thing to do. Google managed to do it with no GPU experience and is still ahead of NVDA. It is likely that Intel will be able to enter this space successfully, as they have widely signalled with the Xe.

There is of course the other large negative driver for Deep Learning, and that is the recession we are now in. Demand for GPU instances on Amazon has collapsed across the board, as evidenced by the fall in pricing. The below graph shows one example: this data is for renting out a single Tesla V100 GPU on AWS, which isthe typical thing to do in an early exploratory phase for a Deep Learning model:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396177958944768/tumblr\_Q86inWdeCwgeakUvh](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396177958944768/tumblr_Q86inWdeCwgeakUvh)

With Deep Learning not delivering near-term tangible results, it is the first thing being cut. On their most recent conference call, IBM noted weakness in their cognitive division (AI), and noted weaker sales of their power servers, which is the line that houses Enterprise GPU servers at IBM. Facebook cancelled their AI residencies for this year, and Google pushed theirs out. Even if NVDA can put in a good quarter due to their new product rollout  (Ampere), the future is rapidly becoming a very stormy place.

**For the Quadro segment**

The Quadro segment has been a cash cow for a long time, generating dependable sales and solid margins. AMD just decided to rock the boat a bit. Sensing NVDA’s focus on Deep Learning, AMD seems to be focusing on HPC – the Radeon VII announced recently with a price point of $1899 takes aim at NVDAs most expensive Quadro, the GV100, priced at $8999. It does 6.5 TFLOPS of FP64 Double precision, whereas the GV100 does 7.4 – talk about shaking up a quiet segment.

**Pulling things together**

Let’s go back to what NVidia fundamentally does – paying their engineers to design chips, getting TSMC to print those chips, and getting board partners in Taiwan to turn them into the final product.

We have seen how a confluence of several pieces of extremely good fortune lined up to increase NVidia’s sales and profits tremendously: first on the Gaming side, weak competition from AMD until 2014, coupled with a great product in form of Pascal in 2016, followed by a huge crypto driven boom in 2017 and 2018, and on the Professional side, a sudden and unexpected increase in interest in Deep Learning driving Tesla demand from 2017-2019 sky high.

It is worth noting what these transient factors have done to margins. When unexpected good things happen to a chip company, sales go up a lot, but there are no costs associated with those sales. Strong demand means that you can sell each chip for a higher price, but no additional design work is required, and you still pay the printer, TSMC, the same amount of money. Consequently NVDA’s margins have gone up substantially: well above their 11.9% long term average to hit a peak of 33.2%, and more recently 26.5%:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr\_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP)

The question is, what would be a sensible margin going forward? Obviously 33% operating margin would attract a wall of competition and get competed away, which is why they can only be temporary. However, NVidia has shifted to having a greater proportion of its sales coming from non-OEM, and has a greater proportion of its sales coming from Professional rather than gaming. As such, maybe one can be generous and say NVDA can earn an 18% average operating margin over the next cycle. We can sense check these margins, using Intel. Intel has a long term average EBIT margin of about 25%. Intel happens to actually print the chips as well, so they collect a bigger fraction of the final product that they sell. NVDA, since it only does the design aspect, can’t earn a higher EBIT margin than Intel on average over the long term.

Tesla sales have likely gone too far and will moderate from here – perhaps down to a still more than respectable $2bn per year. Gaming resumes the long-term slide in discrete GPUs, which will likely be replaced by integrated GPUs to a greater and greater extent over time. But let’s be generous and say it maintains $3.5 Bn Per year for the add in board, and let’s assume we keep getting $750mn odd of Nintendo Switch revenues(despite that product being past peak of cycle, with Nintendo themselves forecasting a sales decline). Let’s assume AMD struggles to make progress in Quadro, despite undercutting NVDA on price by 75%, with continued revenues at $1200. Add on the other 1.2Bn of Automotive, OEM and IP (I am not even counting the fact that car sales have collapsed and Automotive is likely to be down big), and we would end up with revenues of $8.65 Bn, at an average operating margin of 20% through the cycle that would have $1.75Bn of operating earnings power, and if I say that the recent Mellanox acquisition manages to earn enough to pay for all the interest on NVDAs debt, and I assume a tax rate of 15% we would have around $1.5Bn in Net income.

This company currently has a market capitalisation of $209 Bn. It blows my mind that it trades on 139x what I consider to be fairly generous earnings – earnings that NVidia never even got close to seeing before the confluence of good luck hit them. But what really stuns me is the fact that investors are actually willing to extrapolate this chain of unlikely and positive events into the future.

Shockingly, Intel has a market cap of 245Bn, only 40Bn more than NVDA, but Intel’s sales and profits are 7x higher. And while Intel is facing competition from AMD, it is much more likely to hold onto those sales and profits than NVDA is. These are absolutely stunning valuation disparities.

If I didn’t see NVDA’s price, and I started from first principles and tried to calculate a prudent price for the company I would have estimated a$1.5Bn normalised profit, maybe on a 20x multiple giving them the benefit of the doubt despite heading into a huge recession, and considering the fact that there is not much debt and the company is very well run. That would give you a market cap of $30Bn, and a share price of $49. And it is currently $339. Wow. Obviously I’m short here!"
2020-06-30 14:42:56,Blencera,"1,5 Years Since My Journey Began, $52 591 dollars wealthier & only 18 months left.","*Introduction*

I'm 20 years old and my interest for the stock market began at age 16 which later grew into becoming my lovely addiction and before graduating high school i already had a detailed plan on how i would become financial independent and self employed as quick as possible, the first milestone to reach before continuing my dreams are to reach an entire net worth of $100 000 dollars.

In the beginning of setting the $100 000 dollar goal i started with $13 953 dollars and today 1,5 years later i have a total net worth of $66 544 dollars which basically means i only have 33,45% left of the goal to complete within 18 months which is entirely possible. It felt so much harder in the beginning but hard work pays off. While creating the plan i expected to have $52 730 dollars this month of the year but from making better decisions, working hard and presumably a little touch of luck i'm 5 months ahead.

I maximized the overtime-limit at my workplace last year which is roughly 200 hours per year, i managed to reach 212h, sadly the overtime is cancelled due to covid-19 but currently i have 24h 36m in overtime. I've driven taxi *(illegally which i stopped doing)*, been cutting lawns an lending out money in order to speed up the process of my journey.

I've cut almost all unnecessary expenses, i don't travel, i rarely drink alcohol, still driving around in my $1 000 dollar car watching others laugh at me but don't get me wrong, i enjoy traveling and eventfully i'm going to buy myself a new car, i don't want to create wealth just to stare at it. This is something i been planning for a very long time and that i'm fully committed to. It's psychologically frustrating but in the end it's definitely going to be worth it.

*Portfolio distribution*

* *Stocks: 35,79% ($23 816)*
* *Funds: 8,27% ($5 503)*
* *Ready assets:* 55,93% ($37 218)
* *Stocks:* ATVI, AAPL, **AZN**, BAC, **CAST**, DAL, MSFT, **HUFV A**, **KIND SDB**, NFLX, NVDA, **SWED A**, UBER
* *Funds:* **Avanza Auto 6, Avanza USA, Spiltan Aktiefond Investmentbolag**

note: *The Tickers with bold fonts are swedish stocks/funds which may not be available in your country.*

I sold a majority of my shares in the beginning of 2020 expecting a recession or correction but instead we got covid-19 which was extremely unpredictable so i was really lucky that i already had a pretty high amount in liquidity. So far i've been taking advantage of the pandemic by investing in stocks that i hopefully believe will recover. I also did some Q1 report trading which made me about $3 000 dollars profit, i traded CAST, GOOG, TWTR and I'm constantly looking for opportunities.

I'm expected to be fully invested within 1 year and i'm not stressed by having 55,93% liquidity since the inflation is 0. The *""fear of missing out""* is also nothing that's bothering me, everything can happen, especially now.

*Income, expenses & conditions*

My monthly income varies depending on how much i work but i averaged $3 008 dollars after taxes during 2019, i invest everything except $500 dollars and the reason how i can invest 83,37% of my monthly income is because i still live at home. The only reason why i still live at home is so i can take advantage of the opportunity to invest and build myself a foundation.

*The Missing piece*

What i'm missing is friends and connections with this interest in common, i rarely have anyone to talk with when it comes to investments and such so i really hope that i can reach out to some of you. If you're interested just send me a message, thanks for reading and if you have any questions i'll be happy to answer."
2020-08-27 18:58:08,fire_water76,"How I applied Buffet's strategies to my own portfolio, +70% networth, beat SP500 by 40%","I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -> Aug. 

I beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180->300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)

I did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. 

I did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. 

#High level advice:
=========================================

I picked the 7 I agree with.

1. Invest in what you know…and nothing more.
2. Never compromise on business quality
3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever
4. Diversification can be dangerous
5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)
8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)
10. Only listen to those you know and trust 

I firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  

#General mindset:
================
- Keep emotions out of the market
- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.
- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. 
- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. 
- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)
- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. 

#Application:
==================================================================
I was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. 

As a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. 

Based on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good ""feel"" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). 

I tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. 

Post COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.

My hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. 

1. eCommerce + AdTech 
2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)
3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)

These are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:

1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?
2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?
3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? 
4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?
5. Who are their customers and target demographic?
6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.

In March, I took what I believe to be an ""educated gamble"". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.

*EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. 

I have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.

Here are the non FAANGs I chose.

1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. 

2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.

3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. 

4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.

5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. 

6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.

7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. ""Zoom parties"" and ""Zoom dates"" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.

8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. 

10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.

11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. 

12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. 

13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say ""Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?"" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.

14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.

Mutual funds/ETFs
1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. 

2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. 

3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... 

Titanvest:
I was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.

#Some things I do that that are against the grain:

- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.

- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.

- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. 

One example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. 

Lastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. 

Also, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision."
2020-09-29 08:46:06,ixamnis,Investing in ETFs,"A couple of weeks ago, I posted a comment in response to a question about ETFs. This question comes up very often; usually two or three times a week. Maybe more than that.  Several people suggested that it be ""pinned.""  I obviously cannot do that, however if a mod wants to pin this, feel free to do so.  I did make a few modifications and additions to that comment and for those who haven't gone back to see the changes, I thought I'd post it again here.  Hopefully, this helps people who are interested in an investing approach that is either made up of ETFs or that includes ETFs as a part of their portfolio.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**QQQ** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).

**VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VGT**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.

**IWF** \- This is a Russell 1000 Growth fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. Other funds that use the Russell 1000 Growth Index include **RWGV** and **VONG**. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.  **VONE** and **IWB** use the Russell 1000 Index as their benchmark.  **SPYG** and **VOOG** use the S&P 500 Growth Index for their benchmark and would be similar (but not identical) to **IWF**, **VONG** and **RWGV**.

**IWM** \- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.

**VXUS** \- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.

**EEM** \- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com](https://jd.com/), along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors. This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.

**EFA** \- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan. This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca.

**S*****ector fund ETFs:***

**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.

**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.

* **ARKG** \- Genomic Revolution
* **ARKF** \- Fintech
* **ARKK** \- Disruptive Companies (broader market)
* **ARKW** \- Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding)
* **ARKQ** \- Robotics and artificial intelligence
* **PRNT** \- 3D printing technology
* **IZRL** \- disruptive companies based in Israel

**XL series of funds**. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:

* **XLV** \- Health Care
* **XLK** \- Technology
* **XLY** \- Consumer Discretionary
* **XLF** \- Financial
* **XLU** \- Utilities
* **XLE** \- Energy
* **XLB** \- Materials
* **XLC** \- Communications
* **XLG** \- S&P Top 50
* **XLI** \- Industrial
* **XLP** \- Consumer Staples
* **XLRE** \- Real Estate

**CLOUD COMPUTING:** **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance. Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**. Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.

**Aerospace and Defense:** XAR, ITA, PPA

2021-01-17 06:13:12,swaggymedia,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

2021-01-22 09:41:14,theironicfinanceguy,"Microsoft announced they’re doubling the price of their Xbox Live membership. Even further bull case for PC stocks? (CRSR, NVDA, AMD, etc)","https://www.google.com/amp/s/kotaku.com/microsoft-raises-price-of-xbox-live-gold-by-1-a-month-1846108641/amp

Microsoft removed their 12 month option for Xbox Live, and now only have up to a 6 month option priced at $59.99. This is double what the price for Xbox Live used to be.

To this day, Xbox remains the only console that requires an Xbox Live membership to play free-to-play games, including games such as Warzone.

PC gaming was already on the rise, I ditched my Xbox last year to build a PC of my own, but this imo would catalyze the migration off console towards PC gaming even further. 

Thoughts?

EDIT: So I’m editing this as of 1/23 to add that Microsoft has done a complete 180 and decided no membership will be needed to play free to play games, and no price hike on Xbox Live either! I was almost shocked they flipped on this so quickly lol. Thanks for everyone’s inputs!

2021-02-19 11:08:19,bro8619,NEW TRADERS: The internet is loaded with bad advice on buying individual stocks—your core portfolio should be built on old principles,"All I see in Reddit, Twitter, and social media is bad advice for the flood of new traders getting into the market right now. For every random post you see of someone claiming to have made a fortune on an individual stock, there are 40 people who tried and failed, and just didn’t post about it.

Most new traders see that the market is raging and think they can jump into investing and become rich in 3 months by just buying and selling off an initial $5k investment a few times. Here’s the reality: proper investing takes time (patience), discipline (holding), and work (research). For 90%+ of people, your best strategy is in ETFs.

For 100% of people, your best strategy is putting the core of your portfolio in ETFs. Your investments in individual stocks should ONLY be a supplement—ie buying high conviction, high upside plays that won’t damage your portfolio’s stability if you lose. The number of people out there who seem to think a portfolio with 50% PLTR is a legitimate investment strategy is extremely alarming, and they are going to end up losing a lot of money. Maybe not on that stock, but on one of them as they continue down that path.

If you want to invest, you should take the time to read John Bogle’s “little book of common sense investing” to understand why ETFs always beat 90%+ of investment strategies. Also everyone should read Benjamin Graham’s “Intelligent Investor”. If you don’t have time, why would you think you have time to invest?

The distilled version is that the market always broadly goes up in the long term, buying and holding a diversified s&p500 ETF with very low fees (like VOO) is the surest way to guarantee your fair share of returns. Almost everyone on this sub would have better returns over 30 years if they did nothing but that. But of course, that isn’t fun for people.

But know this—the market will come down from here. It is trading well above value. If your money is disproportionately in individual stocks, you have no guarantee of it coming back.

If you’re new to investing out at least 90% of your money in VOO and leave it alone. Forever. The rest you can take shots at individual stocks with. When you add money to your portfolio, add at least 50% to VOO and then with the left over you can buy individual stocks. Do this for AT LEAST a year, but 3 would be better.

If you’re experienced you don’t need me to tell you this but 60% of yours portfolio should still be in ETFs.

Good luck out there. I don’t know when it will come down, but it will.

EDIT: after some people calling me a “boomer” and questioning my selection, I’ll provide disclosures. It’s true that I do not own only ETFs. But I have been investing for a lot while. A bit over 60% of my portfolio is in ETFs or holding companies (BRKB)

2021-02-21 05:27:32,bigbear0083,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021","Good Sunday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021.

# **Stronger economic data could power stocks that thrive in a rebound in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stronger-economic-data-could-power-stocks-that-thrive-in-a-rebound-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead.
*****
> In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.
*****
> While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound – financials, airlines and industrials – stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.
*****
> Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.
*****
> The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.
*****
> He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.
*****
> “He’s going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. “It is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.”
*****
> But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy.
*****
> # Improving forecasts
> Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.
*****
> Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.
*****
> The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.
*****
> ″[Powell’s] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He’s going to be supportive of the administration’s effort to get a big package through,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
*****
> # Key data during the week
> Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy’s and TJX.
*****
> Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday
*****
> The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation.
*****
> “I think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.
*****
> He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.
*****
> “I think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,” he said.
*****
> “The caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that’s going to go away sooner than we think,” Keon said. “Right now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That’s also due to the fact we’re likely to get a big stimulus package.”
*****
> He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities.
*****
> “I think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We’re still bullish. We’re still overweight stocks,” Keon said.
*****
> He said a flood of money could hit the economy.
*****
> “The size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,” Keon added. “Households now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.”
*****
> He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. “You’re going to see an incredible boom.”

> # Value Outperforming Growth But Only for Large Caps

> While the S&P 500 traded lower today, value stocks had a strong finish to the week. Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-DVY.png))**

> Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**

> Value's outperformance today only applied to large caps, though. While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).

> # Industrial Metals Shining Bright

> While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals—as proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index—are up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-1.png))**

> Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-3.png))**

> Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains. As shown in the charts below, both year to date and over the past year, these three metals have risen the most with tin in the number one spot in both respects.

> # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak

> “Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.

> Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage “stairs up, elevator down” certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.

> The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn’t looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?

> **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it’s difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.

> **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in “stay at home” themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:

Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. “It’s our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,” noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Drawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.” If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year’s volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.

> Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

> # Stimulus Matters: Retail Sales Rebound Big in January

> The US economy had a tumultuous year in 2020, to say the least, and after rebounding strongly in the third quarter, the holiday surge in COVID-19 cases increased the risk that the economy may stumble heading into the new year. The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.

> Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December—ordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales—consumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau—the most in seven months—and greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.

> Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**

> “Fiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.”

> Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January’s retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn’t receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.

> Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4–4.5% to 5–5.5%. Yesterday’s retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target—and may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.

> However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden’s fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.

> # Tech Leading in New Highs

> The S&P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH.png))**

> On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.

> # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead

> One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-TA.png))**

> We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.

> # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness?

> Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.

> This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.

> We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks."
2021-02-26 08:16:35,civgarth,Don't give up before you get good.,"Dig through my history. This isn't a self-therapy post after a down week. I've been doing this for a long time.

The reason people fail at this is that their opening trades are way too big for their accounts. And when they are wrong, they are set-back so far that after a string of losing trades, they simply cannot afford to continue.

Let's say I have $1,000,000 in my account. Each trade I open up is rarely above $30,000 to $50,000 dollars or 3% to 5%. And on a $30,000 to $50,000 trade, I'm perfectly happy if I make around $3,000 to $5,000 per trade for the WEEK or even BIWEEKLY! Now that does not seem particularly impressive but if I make 6 trades and 3 of them swing the right way, while the 3 others don't, it's still a pretty good week in terms of absolute dollars. On the 3 where I am wrong, I exit at -3% no matter what happens. This ensures that wins on average are at least 3x bigger than my losses. Also, I only actively trade 15% - 20% of my account. Profits from trades go into long-term positions that I never sell and only add to.

 Now let's say you start with $20,000. This means each trade should really only be about $1,000. So you're thinking, ""What? I can't make a living day trading generating a $100 a week per trade on a good week!!""

No. You can't and you shouldn't. This is why folks should not quit their day job to do this. I didn't quit my day job to do this until 10 years after I started doing this. And here's why.

The professional trader and fund managers are not intrinsically smarter than you. They traditionally had more timely information. That gap has been narrowed with the internet. Where professionals and funds beat you is scale. Here's an exaggerated example. If I can buy 100,000 shares and you can only buy 100, and both of us need $50 today to pay bills, I have virtually no risk whereas you need to hope for a 50% daily return. Most traders who do this at home for income do not make a huge amount of money. I certainly don't. But a large account built over time allows the trader to risk less and less to maintain the same income year over year. Huge funds make shit trades every day. But each trade is less than a fraction of 1% of their book. So stop beating yourself up. The reason you're not doing well is your account is simply too small and you're relying way too much on luck. It takes time and dedication to accumulate enough money. Stop telling yourself you should be further ahead as that thinking will kill you. A lot of you literally started a few months ago. Sometimes you'll have windfalls. Most of the time, trading is boring as shit.

So don't feel bad if you're not getting it right away. You have to tune out the posts where you see people posting wins and losses as that will get you to start gambling instead of trading. A lot of you folks are not 'bad' at this. For some reason, you've just assumed you were 'good' without enough evidence.

Also, I'm not particularly stoic or emotionless on big wins and losses. The long-term positions in my account all got hammered these last few weeks. I will still get pumped or upset and I share with a trading buddy. Find yourself a trading buddy.

TLDR because I am apparently not clear: don't feel bad if you're not successful yet.  You need to get to a decent account size before this starts to click.  

Edit: you guys are nuts and maybe I'm to blame.  I said here is an example.  I even explicitly say I lose half the time.  What on earth did I say that implies I'm a trillionaire?!

Edit: I used perfectly round numbers for examples.  Come on man.  The message is you're struggling because you don't have scale not ""I'm a superstar."" In addition, I didn't start from zero and never implied that I did.

Edit: Holy crap, I even said 'lets say I had..."" to start the example.  The message is about scale and needing time to accumulate.  What on earth are you reading that I'm not seeing?  Y'all need to chill out.  Does it make you feel better to hear me say I also lost a bunch of money on paper this week as well?

Edit: never said I was good at stock picking.  The only thing I will take credit for is limiting losses."
2021-03-18 06:37:14,Fountainheadusa,NVIDIA - $NVDA is a great long term investment,"I bought NVDA today, adding to a position I’d initiated in 2018 and have continuously added to on most dips. 

**The Bull Case**

* A great long term investment as demand for GPU’s will remain high for the next decade
* User markets such as data center, gaming and auto continue to grow
* Leader in its market segments – best in class products
* Gaming - Huge pricing power because of innovative, high quality product improvements such as ray tracing
* Strong competitive advantage with its CUDA software stack
* Mellanox acquisition also gives it a serious competitive advantage in Data Center
* 15% Rev and 20% earnings growth expected per year in the next 5 years.
* The ARM deal, if it goes through will be a huge shot in the arm for NVDA as a strategic near monopoly in licensing 
* NVDA has bought a majority of ARM with its own stock at $485 per share. The equity dilution is only 7%.

**The Bear Case**

* Stretched valuation at 40X Jan -22 earnings and 20X Jan-22 sales 
* Data center GPU users such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are investing heavily to build their own chips. 
* Crypto revenue is not sustainable 
* Post covid environment may reduce gaming and therefore GPU demand

**Challenges**

The ARM deal may not go through

The chances of several governments, especially the U.K and China passing the deal are low.  Several ARM customers have raised concerns about Nvidia likely misusing/abusing its position as the default licensor, forcing customers to use  its own chips.

With these concerns there will be heightened governmental and regulatory scrutiny into NVDA.

There are two interesting articles on the ARM deal. [Here’s the one from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/03/11/why-the-nvidia-arm-acquisition-should-be-approved/?sh=44c39eac45b2)–  the author is hopeful that the deal goes through and why. She believes that governments like the US will push through to gain and maintain its competitive advantage in A.I.

The second is from Trading Places Research and called Nvidia and ARM: All About Control. It’s from Seeking Alpha and why the ARM acquisition makes sense for NVIDIA. Here’s the gist in the author’s own words.

>“But in the end, NVIDIA is trying to do what Apple does regularly, and is so very successful with: control the core technologies behind its products. NVIDIA wants to build a data center behemoth built around the CPU-GPU-DPU-AI stack. They control three of the four layers, and the Arm acquisition would give them the fourth, and most important layer in the stack. They can build this Goliath licensing Arm technology, but they would be dependent on someone else’s roadmap. That someone else is mostly in the business of selling smartphone SoC IP, and is most interested in the future of IoT.  
>  
>But again, this is precisely what is going to scare Arm’s customers so much. The entire smartphone ecosystem is dependent on the continued development of those cores, and if the company is shifting its attention to the data center, the rest may languish down the road. Those customers may even start looking at RISC-V. They have at least 18 months to mull it over, which is a lifetime in tech.”

**Valuation**

Sure, the stock's expensive at 530, but 3 years out NVDA earns about $24 a share, getting the PE down to 22, which is not bad for a 20% grower.

2021-03-22 11:31:59,SnooObjections2665,Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolution,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)
* Semi-conductors
* Biotechnology / Healthcare
* IoT manufacturing
* Renewable energy
* Manufacturing / Mining

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.
   * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce
      * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data.
      * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity.
      * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But as @[ArtakhaPrime](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArtakhaPrime/) mentioned: Amazon and Microsoft ""are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.""
   * **Amazon - $AMZN**
   * **Microsoft - $MSFT**
   * **Cloudflare - $NET - See DD in previous category**
   * **Fastly - $FSLY - Need DD**

   * **Intel - INTC - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Advanced Robotics / automation**
   * **Teradyne - $TER**
      * Focusses on industrial automation, semiconductor testing, wireless testing and storage testing. Customers are Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. **Some of their business units are:**
      * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives
      * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics.
      * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts
      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.
      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries.
   * **Cyberdyne - $CYBQY - Need DD**
   * **ABB - $ABB - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.
   * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.
   * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

* Revenue: $7.16 billion, vs $7.13 billion expected  (up 24% YOY) 

* Global paid net subscriber additions: 3.98 million vs 6.2 million expected

“We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays,” Netflix said in its letter to shareholders.

When asked about their view on competition with the likes of Disney+, Netflix responded: “We don’t believe competitive intensity materially changed in the quarter or was a material factor in the variance as the over-forecast was across all of our regions,”

“As we’ve noted previously, the production delays from Covid-19 in 2020 will lead to a 2021 slate that is more heavily second half weighted with a large number of returning franchises,” 

Netflix also approved a buyback program to repurchase up to $5 billion in common stock, beginning in 2021 with no fixed expiration date. That’s expected to begin this quarter, the company said.

The [items of business](https://i.imgur.com/5wxsOvY.png) for the meeting include an approval from stakeholders to allow the company to **increase the number of authorized shares of common stocks**. This is what is called a [share dilution](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dangers-of-stock-dilution.asp). 

Going further through the proxy statement document, we have the details for Proposal 4 — Approval of an Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Increase the Number of Authorized Shares of Common Stock **from 2 Billion Shares to 4 Billion Shares** https://i.imgur.com/6Myo5r7.png

&nbsp;

>Description of the Proposed Amendment
Our Charter currently authorizes the issuance of up to two billion shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share,
and two million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.
On April 7, 2021, our Board adopted resolutions approving an amendment to the Charter to **increase the number of
authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares. Our Board is recommending the
proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to provide adequate shares of common stock
for general corporate purposes, as further described below. The Board determined that the Proposed Amendment is
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and directed that the proposed Amendment be submitted for
adoption and approval by stockholders at the Meeting.**

...

>If our stockholders adopt and approve the Proposed Amendment, the Proposed Amendment will become effective on the
date that it is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware

...

>As a general matter, the increase in our authorized but unissued shares of common stock as a result of the Proposed
Amendment **would enable the Board to issue additional shares of common stock in its discretion from time to time for**
general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, *expanding our business through mergers and acquisitions,
including shares we would be obligated to issue* **in connection with the pending acquisition of Arm Limited**; stock
dividends and/or stock splits; providing equity incentives to employees, officers or directors; and the raising of additional
capital. Such issuances would occur **without further action or approval of our stockholders** and would be subject to and
limited by any rules or listing requirements of Nasdaq or of any other applicable rules or regulations.

...

>Failure by the stockholders to approve the Proposed Amendment would reduce the ability of the Board to take the

Please go through the document by yourselves (link at the top). I am not experienced, nor that smart. I did not read everything in the document.

I am thinking to vote for approval of proposal 4. In my opinion it is good for the long term. Please remember you are responsible for your own financial decisions. I hold a low amount of shares, and I'll be holding for the long term.

Edit: today's green day brought the price above the resistance line at $614.24. Consolidation in the 600-640 area looks good for the next 2 weeks, unless news catalysts. I am not experienced so make of this what you will.

2021-05-03 19:38:33,thenudedentist,Why is NVDA worth so much more than AMD?,"I'm newer to the game so maybe someone can help me with this.  I am sure I am missing something basic but, looking at their revenue, NVDA is not much more than AMD.  NVDA shows $5 billion for quarterly revenue January 21 and AMD is showing $3.44 billion for the same time period. So roughly, 1.5 times as much revenue.

NVDA is shown being valued at $370 billion and AMD at $97 billion.  That means NVDA is worth almost 4 times as much with only 1.5 times the revenue.  Why is this?  

I like AMD and have been invested since March of last year and plan to keep buying more, but I just wonder why they are worth so much less.  Again, I am sure I am missing something very fundamental here so any input is greatly appreciated."

They are the leader in GPUS (by far) and I really feel like this is a solid company, based on the technology and their earnings.  I am debating on investing 33k until the split to see how it goes.  The stock is at an all-time high, but is clearly in an uptrend, with the revenue to back it up.  What are your thoughts on NVDA? Is this a buy? Or is it too high?"

""If approval is obtained, each NVIDIA stockholder of record at the close of business on June 21, 2021, will receive a dividend of three additional shares of common stock for every share held on the record date, to be distributed after the close of trading on July 19, 2021. Trading is expected to begin on a stock split-adjusted basis on July 20.""

So does this mean I have to own it on June 21 to get the split? And it trades at the new split price July 20? So what if you buy it June 22, are you paying \~$700 for it to trade at the new price July 20 of \~$175 and not eligible for the split?

I called TD Ameritrade, and their corporate action department said the ex date is July 19 and you just need to hold it by July 19 and the record date doesn't matter to get the split.. What? Thats not how I read their press release..."
2021-06-19 15:28:23,Lochtide17,Should I sell NVDA before or after the stock split? Or just keep holding,"I have around 15 shares of NVDA, my average buy in price is $495.

Anyways for the last week or so, I have really been debating whether or no to sell before the stock split, to take my profits and avoid a mass sell off. Some other research I have done showed that some companies actually had some nice buy in after the stock split though. Another thought I had was of course to keep it longer term, just hoping that it continues to slowly rise. 

Anyone in a similar scenario or has any kind of advice?

Why didn't anyone say ""Market up the last 5 days due to Delta variant"" ?   I could find 20 events, both positive and negative, that could be used to explain why the market went up or down.   If the market was up today, no one would talk about delta, they'd talk about some peace treaty somewhere.

Heat wave!  Climate change!  Market goes down.   Ooops, when that was the news, the market went up.   Condo collapse!  Market goes up.   Europe flooding!  Market goes down.  Nope, it went up.

Delta variant has been in the news for months, and NOW the market goes down because of Delta?   Maybe yesterday the market went up because of Delta.  Just as stupid.

Ignore all news.  The market dropped because there were more sellers than buyers.  The scapegoat just happens to be some arbitrary event.

2021-09-08 21:17:51,sin1sback,First Ever Stock Analysis (NVDA/Nvidia DD) *PLEASE CRITIQUE),"tock: Nvidia

Ticker: $NVDA

**#1: Valuation Multiples (Fundamental Analysis)** 

To begin the analysis, Valuation. As a starting point to find the valuation of a company, let’s use the valuation multiple: EV/EBITDA. EV/EBITDA allows us to understand what the company is earning relative to what the company is worth. Why does this matter? It allows us to compare the company’s average to their industry average and other companies within the industry. Again, why does this matter? It measures what the individual is willing to pay for their earnings. So let’s break it down

EV stands for “Enterprise Value”. Enterprise value is made up of the company’s equity, plus total debt, minus their cash. This gives us a better understanding of the company’s value of operations as it factors in both debt and cash. Comparative to just market cap which only considers the value of the company’s shares.

So we have nvidia’s equity: 556687, their total debt: 12791, and their cash: 19782 (measured in billions) so we have the EV: 549.69B (information gathered by Merrill Lynch) 

Now that we have the EV, what is EBITDA? EBITDA or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization is simply putted as the measure of profitability. Like EV, its just a way of understanding a business’s profitability better than net income can. Debt to Equity ratio, Free Cash Flow Yield, P/E Ratio are also helpful, but we aren’t going there. 

Formula: So we’ll take the Net Income of Nvidia which is Earnings before Interest, then we’ll add interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Based off of a 10-k provided by the SEC, the Net Income: 4,332, Interest: 184, Taxes: 77, D and A: 1,098 

EBITDA: 5.69B (in billions) 

So we have the EV/EBITDA of 96.2 

What do we do with this information? We can now compare it to the industry average. You’re looking for them to trade underneath the average. The Software and AI EV/EBITDA average is 106, so Nvidia is trading underneath the industry average. 

**Historical Price Target(s) + Business Fundamentals (Fundamental Analysis)**

Before Nvidia’s stock split (4:1) Nvidia was trading at a high of $750+. While considering we are in an eight year exponential tech bull run, I still think Nvidia was room to run back to close or even as high as its prior high. 

Tesla stock was trading at around $2,213 before their split of 5:1. Then Tesla ran from $80 to almost $900 in a single year. Of course that was attributed to the bull run/short squeeze, but for Nvidia that could mean something. For Tesla to 10x in a year, isn’t hard for nvidia to 2x or even 3x from its current trading price based on their prior movements. Tesla’s 5 year gain in percentages is 1,838% while Nvidias 5 year gain is 1.401%. Their historical price movement is very similar so it wouldn’t be surprising is nvidia followed Tesla on a smaller, slower scale. 

Besides that, Nvidias business is huge for the retail consumption. Bitcoin miners and Gamers have been on a ramped uptrend for the past years and is ever growing. The main graphics card usage is for gamers and miners. So the disruption of graphics card and the demand will be huge for the foreseeable future. 

**#2: Technical Analysis** 

Many people disagree with TA. Most say it is all bullshit and that people are wasting their time fooling around drawing lines on their chart. I 100% disagree with that those statements. The market is mainly based on psychology. The main way a stock price moves is when buyers buy up or when sellers sell down. So when more buyers think the stock will go up vs. the amount of sellers who think the stock will go down, the stock moves upwwards. Of course it isn’t as black and white, but that’s the premise. So some TA evidently becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. 

Daily Chart: 

Sorry, chart is supposed to be here, but stocks doesn't allow.

I can see Nvidia moving in two different ways within the next few weeks.

Option A: We see nvidia break the flag and break above the all time high of $230 and make a new high

Or Option B: We get rejected off the all time high or fail the break out and head down to the $206-207 support.

But Nvidia isn’t a short term play, Tesla took a year to 10x so this is definitely a 1-3 year play at least. 

**How I’m playing Nvidia**

Yes, I’m in nvidia. I wanted to make this so I can get criticism on my first Due Diligence and what I can fix or what I can add. I know this is super choppy and all over the place and I’m sure I missed more important things, but this is where I’m starting.

I have 20% of my portfolio allocated to Nvidia. 12% in shares and 8% in long ATM calls dating in 2023. 

Price Target: $300-$500+ depending on how fast the stock grows. 

Please critique this as I only want to grow as an investor, but please keep the roasting to a minimum :D"

There would be no reason to watch their videos daily. Or their market open and close live streams. The views are how they make their money. Meet Kevin for example makes millions each month off the views.

So these financial youtubers talk about short term plays and high frequency trading so once one play is over you come back for the next. Or they talk about 5, 10, etc stocks they are buying each week.

Yes there is money made in swing/day trading there is also people who lose a lot of money and dont talk about it so you just here from the winners. Im just trying to say those youtubers arent there for long term advice. Some even do horrible stuff like have 50% of portfolio in TSLA or say they are buying options and will dump them into shares after the stock market has a rally that shouldnt be followed."

2021-09-26 15:19:43,Miladyboi,"Shorting NVDA, Should I buy puts?","Wait, Wait, before you downvote me into the depths of hells, let me explain. First, I have been contemplating buying puts on NVDA for about a month now, and it's kept on going up and the only reason I haven't pulled the trigger yet is because I feel like I'm missing something so let me explain my case, then you explain why I'm wrong.

&#x200B;

Ok, first, NVDA is a 550 billion dollar company with 20 billion in revenue and a P/E of nearly 80, and a forward P/E of 60. This is literally SENILE, in 2000, when Intel was all the shit, as a 300 billion dollar company it had a P/E of 40, and now 20 years later it's still down while it doubled it's revenue and 4x it's profit. So, with NVDA trading at a multiple of 80, even if let's say they 3x their eps in the next 5 years which is an extremely absurd assumption as they've already had a ton of growth fueled from covid, they would have 9 dollars of EPS and looking at today's stock price, if it stayed the same they would still be trading at a multiple of 24 which is ridiculous if they somehow just 3x their revenue in a matter of 5 years. Looking at all the growth catalysts I would find it only somewhat reasonable if they 2x their profit which would give them 6 dollars of EPS and keep them at a P/E of 40. That is once again Intels multiple at the peak of 2000 when it was also half the market cap.

Lastly, NVDA has gone up nearly 100% from it's lows in February for two reasons, slightly better than expected earnings and a stock split, none of which would justify that movement.

So, that's what I'm thinking, I HAVE TO BE MISSING SOMETHING RIGHT?, why does this seem so overvalued as such a large company, can someone please explain because if not those 2024 140 strike price puts are looking real sexy."
2021-10-26 09:42:15,apooroldinvestor,Took my first profit and feel a little bad about it NVDA,"Well my NVDA had grown 108% to 6.5% of my portfolio and I woke up debating whether I should trim a little.  

NVDA has been on a great run and I bet in another few months it'll be getting closer to $300, but I felt like I was getting a little greedy and 6.4% was a little much although I love Nvidia and believe its a long term winner.

So I feel a little bad and a little better now that it's around 5.1% portfolio.  Probably didnt make much of a difference in the long run either way, but to me approaching 7% portfolio seemed a little risky.

The gains were long so little tax.  I guess we have to take profits once in a while right?

Anyways I feel the market is so stretched right now so I don't feel bad adding to my cash for if we have a correction!

Just wanted to say Nvidia is one of my favorite investments and companies besides MSFT AAPL and stuff.

I'm still officially up 101%.  Should I trim to 4.5% or just leave it be now?

Thanks.  Long NVDA!!"

2021-11-18 15:38:59,Jodyhighrolex,I Analyzed $NVDA So You Don't Have To,"Hello everyone, Today I will be analyzing $NVDA otherwise known as Nvidia. I also have done analysis for other companies as well. Feel free to check them out on my profile! For those that don’t know, Nvidia is a company based in the United States that designs graphics, processing units, and chip units. They reported earnings for Q3 on 11/17. They did good overall reporting revenue of $7.1 billion, which is a 50.1% Increase from the same quarter last year, and beat estimates by $290 Million. They also reported record Data Center revenue of $2.94 Billion, and record Gaming revenue of $3.22 billion. At the time of this post, NVDA is sitting at just about $316.75, gaining over $24 today alone. Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up. They are up $93.85 in the last month alone!

During the press release, they talked about a lot of great things NVDA has done or is in the process of doing. For example NVDA discussed plans to build something which they call Earth-2, Earth-2 is an AI supercomputer which will be made specifically to predict climate change. Another cool thing they’re doing which I’m sure some of you have heard of is the Omniverse avatar, Omniverse is a technology platform which generates interactive AI avatars. The avatars that are created through this platform will be 3-D. According to NVDA they will be able to see and speak. The avatar will be able to talk about a very wide range of subjects. In the Automotive sector, They released AI technology which allows safe autonomous driving on streets and a computer architecture and sensor set made specifically for self-driving systems. I could go way more in depth on the other great advancements this company is doing but these were my favorite and I think you guys get the point.

Now let's talk about their evaluation…

1. Nvidia beat expectations, and they had pretty strong revenue growth in Q3, however, percentage wise, they did fall short compared to their semiconductor competitors, such as AMD and TSM. Their EBITDA margins are also looking pretty good. However, compared to other competitors in the space, once again they fall short, other companies in the space captured a larger portion of the market. Overall, Nvidia’s multiples are leading more than any other company.
2. Management believes that there is a lot more growth in store. They are growing at a tremendous rate right now. In the earnings call, The CEO of NVDA said that they are finally transitioning into becoming a software company. Nvidia is the dominant leader in creating GPU hardware and now they are also becoming a leader in AI tools and virtualization technology. NVDA wants “Every transaction that goes over the internet to touch a GPU” While also selling the best software available to utilize their GPU’s.
3. Nvidia's current market cap is very substantial. This stock has had extreme hype as of recently, especially because of the anticipation regarding the Omniverse. It’s definitely possible that this company could see great growth over the coming years. Especially since they basically have a monopoly on GPU hardware and also very extensive experience in visualization and AI, but they will be fighting a lot of competition from companies that want in on the action. Furthermore, Uk regulators have been pushing back on Nvidia’s $40 billion acquisition of the chip designer Arm and if this transaction is hindered then it could put a pretty big crater in Nvidia's plans. Overall, I believe their company is very overvalued right now and people should wait for a dip if they want to buy into this company.

I hope you all learned something from my analysis of this company. Thanks for reading everyone!

2021-12-01 01:20:48,PeekingPotato,Is NVDA a good buy right now?,"Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I´ll try to do that and post it here. That´s my first analysis for NVDA. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything.

Today we will look through the basics of NVIDIA´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for NVDA´s stock using discounted free cashflow.

This is not financial advice and I do not own shares in NVIDIA. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence.

First let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **45%** of their sales comes from **Gaming**. The **Data Center** makes up around **41%**. Another **8%** comes from **Professional Visualization**. Then there is **3%** from **OEM**, and another **2%** from **Automotive**.

For the valuation:

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 9,2%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for NVDA´s stock of **$327 per share**. But because we have to account for **NVDA´s equity** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$311 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that.

With NVDA´s price being at **$326** **per share** right now, it´s kind of fairly valued. That´s why I think buying *heavily* might not be a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.

**Where I see NVDA´s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$868 per share** which is definitely higher than what it is now. 

**What I´ll do.** I believe NVIDIA is here to stay. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why, although the price is not exactly where I would want it to be (I want to include a margin of safety), I will maybe start to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I won´t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm.

Thank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again."
2021-12-04 05:47:49,Alternative_Tower_38,Has anyone tried a strategy where they do the exact opposite of everything Cramer says,"So, I was just reading the Intelligent Investor (updated 2004 version) and there's a paragraph about how ""In February 2000, hedge-fund manager James J. Cramer"" was basically pumping and hyping internet stocks and that putting $10000 into his picks would have left you with $597 by the end of 2002. (Truly impressive even for me having lost 52% on CD Projekt)

Now there's memes about him saying he wants as much DIDI shares as possible and I'm sure there are many other examples. (I'm not suggesting anyone can tell if a stock will be delisted or not unless you work for the government).

So, has anyone tried or backtested a strategy where you short everything he says to buy and buy everything he tells people to sell?"
2021-12-08 06:36:07,Jealous-Ride-7303,Why is NVDA so richly valued?,"Hi everyone, I'd like to preface this by saying that I'm a new investor around 3-months and that I'm not dogging anyone's investment decisions. I primarily invest by DCA into ETFs like SPY, QQQ and DIA. I've also decided to branch out by nibbling on individual stocks within the QQQ. I find NVDA interesting and hold a small position from when it was $226/share, I think it has a good business model, a good history of profitability and it has an edge over other chipmakers in the sense that they're the best at graphics technology.

However, I can't understand why people continue buying into NVDA stock at current values where the PE is 95+ NVDA has the potential to grow no doubt, but does it really have the potential to grow at a rate that justifies such a rich valuation today? Or is it just that traders/WSB types are playing games with the stock?

Wouldn't a better investment be to look elsewhere in the semiconductor industry for better deals? I like MU (PE: 17) because RAM and storage is needed universally for pretty much anything that needs a chip, AMAT (PE: 26) because they make equipment for foundries which means if NVDA wins, AMAT wins. Investing in TSM (PE: 31) might be good for similar reasons as AMAT.

I acknowledge that I don't know too much about investing (obviously) and don't even know necessarily much about reading up on fundamentals. I mainly look at PE, PEG and look at the historical gains of the stock and company. I'd just like to have a better understanding.

Cheers everyone."
2021-12-14 16:12:44,OhioBaseball,Long-term NVDA investor speaking here,"I've owned NVDA for years. I've always believed in the potential even if it was volatile (trust me, there's been some major swings). I had written calls at $250 months ago before the hard run up. I sold a majority of my shares that the price. I had followed this wonderful company's stock price every day for years. It honestly kind of felt like it was my child. I watched it grow up, I believed in it and it went on to do wonderful things, but at $250 it was moving out of the house and going away to college in another state (Stanford on full-ride, of course). Everything it did since then I'm not surprised how great, but he's on his own now. If things ever get too bad ($200/share??), we're going to let him stay at the house and wait for a more sunny day so he can flourish again. There's a lot of big buyers out there that feel this way. Short-term downside will be tolerable because there's a lot of incremental buyers that still love this company but let it go because sometimes valuations get too high.

My point is if you believe in the technology, there's going to absolutely be volatility because its been like this forever, but its a part of the investment -- nothing goes straight up. Its hard to stomach sometimes but its part of the game and smart, well-run companies are going to make it in USA like nowhere else in the world."
2021-12-14 23:09:45,apooroldinvestor,NVDA 7% of portfolio at $203 cost basis.,"So NVDA is 7% of my portfolio right now and I'm in for long term.

The shares are long and half are in ROTH so I could dump some if I needed.

Whats the best way to lower my cost basis though?

Should I see if they go any higher in a rally and sell half above $300 or something and then if NVDA crashes to $200 buy back in?

Or should I just maintain 7% and buy more shares in the event of dropping to $200 ..... Or lower?

$200 would be a 40% drop from its ath of $346.

I guess it could go lower, but i don't care cause I'm in for at least 5 years or 10.

2021-12-19 15:57:21,skilliard7,NVDA- Sell if you still hold it,"Nvidia is currently trading at a price to earnings of 85, which is astronomical. It is priced at this level because investors believe earnings will continue to grow very quickly. If earnings don't continue to grow substantially YoY, the stock will tank.

However, Nvidia faces a perfect storm in 2022 that will likely severely impact their earnings:

- Eth3reum is scheduled to go proof of stake in H1 2022. This means that millions of GPUs, no longer capable of earning a profit in excess of electricity costs will hit the secondary market and undercut prices of new GPUs.

- Intel is rumored to introduce their new dedicated GPUs in H1 2022, which will compete with Nvidia on the low to mid end.

- Rising interest rates in general are likely to have an impact on growth stocks.

- AMD's upcoming GPUs are rumored to be 3x as fast as their current generation flagship. If these rumors turn out to be true, Nvidia's dominance in the industry is threatened.

Nvidia doesn't really have much upside from here to justify holding it in excess of market cap weights, but there is substantial downside risk if any of these risks pan out."
2021-12-27 20:31:00,apooroldinvestor,NVDA is 4.3% of my portfolio. Cost basis is $127. It's in my ROTH so I can sell no taxes.,"NVDA 4.3% of my portfolio.  Cost basis is $127.  In ROTH so I can sell now.  What would you do?

I want to hold for long term but if it were to sink to $220 or something next year I'd rather sell now and buy back in at $220 a share obviously since there's no tax implication.

Of course some think it could sink below $200 also.  So obviously I could take my profits and buy even more shares at a lower entry price.

I do have 20% cash right now but that doesn't negate the fact that I would be better off selling current shares at $309 and buying back in at $220 or $190.

What should I do?"
2021-12-29 13:22:17,karnoculars,To all of you who are red this year while the S&P500 is up 30%,"Lately I keep hearing the same old narrative from beat-down investors on r/stocks who are down YTD even when SPY is up 30%: ""everything is down this year, the indexes are just being propped up by mega-cap tech companies like AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA"".  They go on to say that just because they are down this year and indexes are up, it's actually not that bad because the mega-caps are hiding the true state of the market.

Well, let's look at the data shall we...

Here are the YTD gains of a whole bunch of indexes from all the industries that I could think of, most of which don't have many of the aforementioned mega-caps in it:

VGT: +32.99% (Technology)  
XLF: +34.87% (Financial)  
XLE: +47.15% (Energy)  
XLI: +22.38& (Industrials)  
XLV: +24.99% (Healthcare)  
DBC: +43.37% (Commodities)  
PAVE: +37.90% (Infrastructure)  
AVUV: +42.18 (Small Cap Value)  
SCHD: +27.87% (Dividends)  
SMH: +43.21% (Semiconductors)  
ITA: +13.16% (Aerospace and Defense)  
TRVL: +6.82% (Travel)

As can be seen, every major sector of the market is green for the year.  Even travel and aerospace, two of the hardest hit sectors, are up YTD.  Every single other sector is up at least 20%.  It would take an objectively bad investment plan to pick only losers out of this sea of green.

So can we please stop with the BS that a handful of companies are propping up a dying market.  If you are down this year, you really need to review your investing decisions because you are almost certainly investing in companies with poor fundamentals that have been driven entirely by hype and/or trading options in a way that is pure gambling.  I just hope that you are taking the right lessons away from this year.  Please consider putting the majority of your money into broad market index funds.

Wishing everyone a successful 2022!"
2022-01-01 14:26:33,apooroldinvestor,Just sold my NVDA and put it in PG for 2022. Dumb move?,"Well I had a 4.1% weighting in NVDA and have now reduced it to about 3% for 2022.  I put the proceeds (they were all long shares) in PG for the new year.

Analysts are saying that PEs will contract this year as the FED raises rates and that things like NVDA will take a big hit.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still long NVDA and my cost basis is $127 and it's still 3% of my portfolio, but I feel the share price WILL go lower and if it hits 200 to 230 or so I'll probably add some more shares.

Also, analysts are predicting things like consumer staples will fare well this year and so I thought a nice balance would be to add some PG for a little stability.

I've also got things like UNH HD SHW ODFL TMO and NEE, but feel we may correct 10 to 20% towards February or March.

I'm about 40% MSFT AAPL GOOGL NVDA and ASML and a little CRWD and PYPL recently purchased after their beat downs.

2022-01-13 17:52:49,ok_cool_got_it,I messed up bad,"I'm down heavily on some of my investments. I invested in MTCH at $160 (now $123), Robinhood at $50 (now $14), Affirm at $109 (now $72), Farfetch at $45 (now $27) and some other smaller investments that are also running me a loss.

I can't believe I gave into the hype. Looking back at the time of my investments, all these stocks were trading at \~80-90 their sales and they're all undergoing correction now. Some of them have lost half (if not more) of their value and it'll take decades for them to recover.

I do have some investments that are doing really well and keeping me afloat, but I now understand the importance of the three fund portfolio, or just investing in index funds.

I'll keep coming back to this post every time we enter a new bubble, just to discipline myself and not get carried away by the noise.

**EDIT:** finished work and read through the comments and there seems to be some confusion around the PE I mentioned. I meant \[80, 90\] (x = variable). If the PE was around 8\~9, that'll make it a good bet and I probably wouldn't have written this.

**EDIT 2:** Wow, lots of great advice in the comments. I really didn't expect this post to garner so much attention, but I'm thankful for all the learnings shared in the comments. I'm 26 years old and this is my third year investing. I think this fiasco was a blessing in disguise. In my first two years of investing, everything was in the green. I felt I could do no wrong and I've found the cheat code to grow my money. I've learned my lesson the hard way but I'm still young and I'd rather lose some money now than 10 years later when I have more responsibilities.

And for those asking, I have around $230k invested in the market (apart from a Vanguard 401k, but I don't ever look at that) and my losses accrue to $65k in total. Overall, I'm still in the green but barely. Hoping to DCA more into QQQ (I work in tech so I understand Nasdaq 100 much better) and get the numbers up."
2022-01-15 18:12:34,Retropixl,NVDA OR MSFT for starting a long term portfolio.,"I have around $1000 to play with, I’m only 21 so I understand it’s not a lot to play with but I’d rather put the $1000 into one play for the time being and then focus on diversification later on when I have more money. 

I really like NVDA and I think they have an incredible future ahead of them but I’m very wary of their price at the moment. Buying right now probably won’t matter in 15 years as timing the market usually never works in anyones favor.

Microsoft stands out to me because they have a relatively nice dividend, especially for a tech stock, and I think they’re growing cloud computing, gaming, and software at a very fast rate. I think it’s price right now is pretty fair for the value that they offer but who knows I could be wrong. 

I’d rather stay away from an ETF for the time being because $1000 isn’t gonna do much in an ETF. I also plan on investing $25 a week into one of the choices above."

How can you be bullish on one and bearish on the other for the exact same thing?

* Fed raising rates.
* Russia sanctions and possible invasion [cutting off key semiconductor materials](https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-tells-chip-industry-brace-russian-supply-disruptions-2022-02-11/).

In the next few months, these will play out and really pummel the semi stocks. But the good news is these are temporary events. After 1-2 years, we'll find a way around Russian chokehold on these key materials, and inflation will probably be slowed. While that's happening, covid is still subsiding and innovation continue it's relentless march of driving productivity forward.

To be clear, **I'm not saying to buy the dip right now.** But I'm tempted to start a ""eat ramen"", ""get a third job"", ""cancel Netflix"" regime for myself to start preparing as much as possible to start buying mid or later this year.

These semi stocks are becoming the new FANGS, and this upcoming dip this year might be the best chance to buy them before they rocket into FANG status.

OK here's the cons in my theory:

* China could still be a ticking time bomb. Most experts say their lockdown strategy is not viable for Omicron. Could be their supply chain is a lot more broken than we realize. Plus that real estate problem is still ongoing and their president is kinda insane.

* The Fed could freak out and raise rates too quickly, putting us into a recession.

* Some industry reports say oversupply of semiconductors could happen as early as 2023.

Congrats to all bulls who held this week.

I wanted to buy NVDA at $210 but I held because I THOUGHT it was overvalued at current market with trailing P/E 50s, forward P/E \~35-40 and PEG 2.5. However, NVDA jumped to 260 in 4 days, which is 23% gain. For some reason, investors keep adding or buying NVDA. In the other hand, AMD and QCOM are underperforming even though they are much cheaper. 

Am I am interpreting current valuation incorrectly? Is NVDA overvalued with entry price around $210?"

Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members.

I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split.

I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

Is it just a coincidence all these events are happening at the same time?

2022-04-10 17:21:55,Fountainheadusa,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,"**Nvidia $NVDA is my largest position and also the best performing one. I've been selling it between $304 and $260 and haven't bought any back and plan to buy at around $180.**

I'm a buy and hold investor and most of my gains have come from long term positions in stocks such as NVDA, ADBE, AAPL, PYPL and GOOG, to name a few. Having said that, I did take profits when valuations got stretched, PYPL and ADBE are two cases where I've got rid of 80% of my holdings because future growth looked subdued compared to their earnings and sales multiples.   
In Nvidia's case this is an important indication that growth may decline some in the next few quarters, after torrid growth in the last two years.  
[https://ih.advfn.com/stock-market/NASDAQ/nvidia-NVDA/stock-news/87795157/nvidia-amd-lead-chip-decline-as-truist-finds-hard](https://ih.advfn.com/stock-market/NASDAQ/nvidia-NVDA/stock-news/87795157/nvidia-amd-lead-chip-decline-as-truist-finds-hard)

However, I still think NVDA's long term growth story in datacenter, autos and metaverse is largely intact and **then some**, but in the current market environment where inflation and high interest rates are going to drive multiples down -  it would be more prudent to enter only after there is enough margin of safety. **At a price of $180, NVDA's 2025 fiscal year forward PE's and P/S ratios come down to  20 and 9, respectively. Those are attractive valuations and I'd add more than what I've sold. At $150 I would back up the truck.**"
2022-04-13 13:16:20,tinyraccoon,"Out of NVDA, GOOGL, and MSFT, which one do you think will have the best future in the next five years?","Assuming you can only buy one of the three and that you are not interested in something like QQQ.  Also assume that one already has other plays like value, oil, etc.  e.g. I am not asking if these stocks are overpriced and if we should instead buy CVX or HAL, etc.

NVDA has AI, which appears to still be at an early stage and has unrealized potential.  However, it is unclear how much of that potential is real and how much is hype.  If we get a bear market, NVDA will drop but might come back once the AI potential is realized, especially if the AI is needed for the event triggering the bear market (e.g. making smart weapons to combat Russia, accelerating green technologies to combat climate change, etc.).

GOOGL also has AI and some other plays like Waymo, but GOOGL remains mostly advertising.  If we do get a recession or a bear market, GOOGL could get hit hard and might also be slower to recover.

MSFT seems the most stable of the three, but I'm not sure if the growth will be as high going forward.  Seems like most businesses already use Office and while MSFT could raise the price, there does not appear to be as much expansion in terms of brand new accounts.  Video games are also rather competitive with PS5 having great games so far, and Switch also not being shabby.

**EDIT**  Thanks, all.  I read all of your comments and will keep all three but might trim them some later to avoid over-concentration in any particular stock."
2022-04-20 21:33:00,FastAssSister,Tech Stocks Are Absurdly Cheap Now: putting my money where my mouth is,"Buckle in.

Investing isn't easy, and yet people are--and always will--try to act like it is. Just like every other period in stock market history, retail 'investors' are being lazy and emotional and valuing businesses based off the direction their prices are heading rather than long term fundamentals. Volatility is the price you pay for performance. Thinking it's time to sell tech and buy Kellogg, with corporate profits RISING, will get you into deep trouble. 

No, being a good investor has absolutely nothing to do with being 'contrarian'. It just so happens that retail is too lazy and emotional to notice that prices tend to head fake away from where people should be buying at any given timeframe. Sometimes these head fakes point to different asset classes, other times to different assets within any given class. 

Right now, it's both. 

People think tech is in 2001 territory strictly because of price action, when we are in literally the opposite place outside a handful of overvalued and overhyped names; and people think bond yields are becoming attractive, when bonds are in the worst bear market in years (though this could change at any time considering the overreaction we've seen in Fed rate predictions). **This is precisely when you should be buying reasonably priced tech with strong cash flows, pricing power, quality earnings growth, barriers to entry (either a difficult industry to break into or an outright moat, which is very rare and hard to predict but** ***Facebook has one*****), network effects, and demand inelasticity.** Your stocks don't have to have all of these elements, but the more, the merrier. 

**\*\*\***

**Here's some oversimplified but VERY true deductive reasoning that 99% of 'investors' fail to heed:**

\-Companies with higher earnings growth deserve higher valuations  
\-Companies with better pricing power deserve higher valuations  
\-Companies with higher quality earnings growth deserve higher valuations  
\-Netflix and Facebook are still growth companies, their earnings quality is only improving, and they have IMMENSE pricing power that they've only begun to tap into  
\-Proctor & Gamble has a 40% higher relative valuation than Netflix  
\-CAMPBELL'S SOUP has a higher valuation than Facebook  
\-So-called 'investors' firmly believe that staples are the place to be right now, because 'interest rates' and 'inflation'. 

**Okay...**

\-Corporate profits drive stock prices--literally in lock step--over the long run  
\-Inflation is good for corporate profits  
\-Inflation requires higher interest rates  
\-Higher interest rates are a headwind for stocks  
\-Higher interest rates ARE A LITERAL CATASTROPHE FOR BONDS  
\-Holding cash *is basically taking a financial gun and pointing it at your face and pulling the trigger*  
\-The answer is to own quality assets, which are companies with strong cash flows, moats, network effects, etc.

**Millions of retail investors are absolutely convinced that tech is overvalued--but it's not because of poor fundamentals. Honestly, it's not even because of inflation, interested rates, or Ukraine. It's simply because prices are going down.** Do yourself a favor. Look at sentiment from one year ago today. Facebook to $600 was a done deal. Netflix was overpriced, and I wouldn't have bought it at near $700, but if anyone thought we would be below $230, we'd be minting new billionaires by the second because of their OTM puts. Amazon is more underpriced than I've maybe ever seen based off what we can easily see (the market has never understood Amazon, and AWS ALONE is clearly a multitrillion dollar valuation by 2030). 

**FACTS:**

\-**Amazon** PE is lowest ever while its future core businesses--AWS and ads (they are doing more ad revenue than YOUTUBE now, and AWS brings in more profit than any business line now, so if you think Amazon is a retail business you should be buying index funds...)--are growing at 40% or more.   
\-**Facebook** PE is lowest ever--last time this happened was three years ago, their stock price crashed to $131, and with this incredible overreaction they're STILL up 54% since then.   
\-And now to my favorite part: **Netflix** is at its lowest valuation since the 2000s and perhaps ever--who cares before then, it wasn't Netflix, it was a frickin' mail-order DVD company. Its PEG is .84. Its earnings have plateaued on SEVERAL occasions only to leap, over and over again. Just like Facebook, they were bound to hit a plateau for their core use base at some point. But if you think that means they're done growing out earnings--not to mention expanding other business lines, like Amazon did with AWS and ads, and Microsoft did with Azure--you need to ask yourself whether you have enough knowledge and experience here. 

In a way, investing really isn't that hard. **You just have to actually buy businesses and not obsess over the value of your portfolio every day**. If you do that, you're smart enough to see that tech could fall another 30% right now--and it would only present an even better buying opportunity with even more upside. As Buffett said after 2008, he might've been early, but he still got rich. And trust me, buying now might be early, but it will be INSANELY lucrative. 

SO SO SO many companies are just dirt cheap. People think DropBox is a shitty cloud business, when its top line is growing double digits and they're priced like Campbell's f'kn Soup. People think GoPro is a shitty camera business when it has begun adding software with INCREDIBLE margins and is growing rapidly again. Upstart is literally the only company in the market with the triple crown--triple digit growth, massively profitable, and BUYING BACK STOCK--yet its price was cut by 80%. There are just so many tech companies getting caught up in this indiscriminate selling, as if they're DoorDash or Rivian or Nikola or Snowflake, or any of the incredibly overpriced businesses, good or bad, that deserved to be cut in half.  

People calling this tech bubble 2.0 are either too young to understand what the tech bubble was, or too stupid to understand what it was. This is the literal opposite of the tech bubble. We have companies with tens of billions in FCF being repriced as if they're going out of business. Earnings are GROWING. We are in a BOOM cycle--IN TECH. You are being fooled--AGAIN. During the tech bubble, it's not that companies weren't making money...**THEY WEREN'T EVEN BRINGING IN REVENUE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE?** Not even the most overvalued companies today (aside from Rivian and Nikola) can attest to such an atrocity. 

I pity the people who need to see instant green in their portfolios, and I hope to see your sea of !Remind Me! posts for five to ten years from now. **For those of you who take anything away from this post, here's putting my money where my mouth is:**

Here's my portfolio weighted by notional impact--i.e. ITM calls carry more leverage despite moving the same amount as 100 shares of a stock, or ATM short puts I've written to buy at a lower cost basis or just hold the premium. (**I plan on opening a Netflix position at some point soon.**)

**$UPST:** **16.9%** (Pretty much the perfect stock: AI lending company that's barely unaffected by rates and loan origination volume; already profitable by a mile; reinvesting capital into massive TAMs; and already has permission from the board to buy back stock. Hope you don't judge a stock by its PE because that's how you miss pretty much every single winner, from Amazon to Salesforce to Netflix.)  
**$CIM:** **7.7%** (Retracing like a tech stock right now with fortress balance sheet and 12% dividend yield--and climbing. Chimera did even better following the pandemic after cutting its dividend yield, which made for the perfect time to buy.)  
**$OSTK:** **7.54%** (Retail furniture business that's stealing market share from Wayfair and growing rapidly yet with a stock price selling as if it's going out of business--oh yeah, and they've got Medici Ventures, which is priced at zero.)  
**$Z: 6.56%** (Vertically integrated media business of which people seem to have zero understanding. It's literally in the best shape it's ever been: shed of its worst business segment and raising capital from home inventory; growing at over 20%; and selling at a 75%+ discount...yet people hate it infinitely more than when it was up near $200...LOL)  
**$AMZN: 5.97%** (Enough said above. This is a multitrillion dollar business that checks every box listed above selling at less than half its true value.)   
**$APPS:** **5.25%** (Growing triple digits, profitable, and with insane barriers to entry--not quite Upstart, but this is a 5x play.)  
**$URI:** **5.12%** (Picks and shovels play for infrastructure boom ahead. Someone will pass a version of build back better, and this company is a gem even without government subsidy. Also, United Rentals helps balance out my insanely tech-weighted portfolio just a tad bit, though that's not at all why I bought it--because I could care less how much money I lose in the short term to maximize long term gains.)  
**$FB:** **5.2%** (The greatest network company of all time--a company whose business model will never be repeated--is trading at a multiple 7% lower than the Campbell f'kin Soup Company. Enough said.)  
**$CLSK:** **4.71%** (One of the fastest growing companies in the world; already profitable; ESG sustainable Bitcoin miner; QUADRUPLE DIGIT GROWTH on the top line; trading at a SINGLE DIGIT forward PE--crashing as if both they and Bitcoin are going to zero.)  
**$STNE:** **4.37%** (A big boo-boo in their long book and concerns about the Brazilian economy are apparently enough to crash the stock over 90%. Like several other stocks on this list, earnings give a HUGE temporary boost because of how incredibly strong they are, only to watch the gains wither away because of indiscriminate selling in the tech space.)  
**$AMAT: 3.14%** (Picks and shovels play for the semiconductor bull market that will last for decades to come. Probably the only company on this list that I'd call fairly valued, but it's such a great company it's worth every penny.)  
**$PLTR: 3.09%** (It's apparently fun to hate Palantir because it was a meme stock. But if you can do math, 30% compound interest for 10 years does not a meme stock make. Probably the only stock on this list that I might even call *over*priced, but I also think it's worth every penny with a smaller position.)  
**$AMD: 2.97%** (Trading as if China is going to invade, tear down TSM, collapse the market for chips, and send interest rates to 50%. Beyond idiotically cheap.)  
**$MU: 2.85%** (Micron's pricing power is unmatched in this industry. Very few companies do what they do and none do it as well--and they're trading for pennies on the dollar.)  
**$DBX: 2.66%** (Apparently it's cool to hate Drew Houston? I don't know, but in addition to what was mentioned above, this company is set to buy back half it's MFing float. Like, are you kidding me?)  
**$NVDA: 2.61%** (Only reason I don't have a bigger allocation is because NVIDIA puts my total semi allocation at around 9%. I also owned Intel for a hot second before I rolled it into other plays. Think The whole space is going to continue to skyrocket, but no one has the creativity or talent that NVIDIA does.)  
**$BNTX: 2.6%** (The market thinks that this company stumbled upon vaccines, that covid is ending tomorrow, and that they have no other pipeline. The reality is that BioNTech is set to sell billions more in vaccines for a long time coming, and all of this is an incredibly massive tailwind to their rare diseases pipeline.)  
**$WBD: 2.22%** (It's always funny when some jackoff at BoA comes out with a report about how the merger between Discovery and Warner Brothers will create synergies that make this a $45 stock--6 months after the deal is announced. The stock rocketed above $30, then was indiscriminately sold off back to where it started--for no reason. The market is so efficient.)  
**$GPRO: 2.2%** (As mentioned above, this has become a software company with total control over its market and prices. 96% of action cameras in America are GoPros. The recurring revenue on that software makes this at least a $30 stock. But nobody wants to own it because RemEmBEr tHat TiME WheN iT SolD OfF?)  
**$NOK: 2.1%** (5G is them and some other guy. Enough said.)  
**$CRM: 1.81%** (This company does not stop growing. One of the best companies in the world and there is no end in sight. Personally think the Slack purchase is being totally swept under the rug. It's just that time of the cycle when you're supposed to doubt Benioff.)  
**$NLST: 1.33%** (Very unknown memory company with massive lawsuits against a bevy of huge companies and great prospects outside those lawsuits. They settled the lawsuit with SK Hynix and still have pending cases for patent infringement against the likes of Samsung, Micron, and Google--all of which are entirely legitimate.)  
**$AMRS: 0.8%** (A deep future play for molecules-as-a-function. This one is very nuanced and I'm getting tired of writing. You'd have to look into this one yourself to truly understand the importance of synthetic, sustainable molecules used in the place of limited and/or endangered organics at far cheaper prices across the cost spectrum.)  
**$SFT: 0.29%** (Kind of a random little lottery bet on a company with a market cap lower than its fourth quarter revenue alone. But with no path to profitability in sight, that's all it is: a lottery ticket with a VERY small amount of AUM allocated.) 

*It's not possible to create a perfect weighting with options in your portfolio, especially short puts, but I've done the best I can. For example, notionally, I could be tied to even more* ***Upstart*** *than I've represented here. But Upstart would have to be ITM across three separate strikes (70, 80, and 100) by January 2023, which nobody can predict. (What I can say is that anything under $100 is DIRT cheap for Upstart, so I'm more than happy to own it at about $51, $55, and $66, which would be the breakeven prices at each strike, respectively, when including the outrageous premium I was paid for writing these puts.) I split the notional values of being assigned each put in half to represent the fact that Upstart is currently ITM for my 100 puts, ATM for the 80, and OTM for 70. Arbitrary, but so is anything in this case, even if you'd use Black Scholes somehow.*"

1. PYPL - Currently trading at a price it hasn't seen since 2018, and is at the lowest P/E in its entire history. The last time the P/E was anywhere near this low was back in 2016. At that time PYPL's EPS was $1\`.11. It's now at $3.03. So it's trading at levels not seen in years but is earning triple what it was earning back then.
2. GOOG - Currently trading at the lowest P/E in more than 7 years. It came close to this level back in 2019, when it was earning $49.50/share. It's now earning $110.50, more than double what it was earning then.
3. DOCU - Currently trading at a P/S of 6.3. The last time it was at this sales ratio was back in 2019, pre-COVID. At that time it was generating $7.84/share in revenue. It's now generating $10.70/share. Gross margins are higher now too.
4. CHWY - Currently trading below its IPO price at the dirt cheap P/S of 1.1. The previous lowest P/S was 3.2, back at the IPO when it was generating $13.40/share in revenue. It's now generating $21.30/share in revenue on higher gross margins.

Bottom line: there are some companies out there trading at or below past levels despite generating considerably more earnings or sales now than they were back then. The unprofitable ones will rebound more slowly, but these are the higher quality companies that the smart money will start snapping up when it looks like the dust is settling. So be ready."

Paul Pelosi, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, made a stock purchase of over $1 million in a computer chip company just weeks before a potential vote in Congress which would give a massive subsidy to the industry. 

 Mr. Pelosi made a purchase of between $1 million and $5 million [shares of Nvidia](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/stocks), a semiconductor company, according to a disclosure filing made by Speaker Pelosi's office. He exercised 200 call options, or 20,000 shares, the disclosure states. The disclosure raised eyebrows, as Reuters reported that the Senate could vote on a bill that contains billions of dollars in subsidies within the semiconductor industry as early as Tuesday. 

Curtis Houck, managing editor of right-leaning media watchdog NewsBusters, said it was ""no accident that the liberal media have made the decision to ignore"" the story that could damage Pelosi. 

""For those that are aware of it, they have zero comprehension and/or shame to realize how it's a quintessential story of how the elites work for their own financial benefit, not that of the American people,"" Houck told Fox News Digital. 

Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi's office has attempted to distance the House Speaker from her husband’s recent stock trades. 

""The Speaker does not own any stocks. As you can see from the required disclosures, with which the Speaker fully cooperates, these transactions are marked ‘SP’ for Spouse. The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions,"" spokesman Drew Hammill told FOX Business. 

In 2020, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, N.C., and other high-profile lawmakers came under fire for stock sales in the run-up to the COVID-19 pandemic that were suspected to have been made based on confidential information about the pending outbreak. CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and NBC all covered the story. ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" even featured a lengthy commentary about it. 

 Charlie Gasparino appeared on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Monday to discuss whether the move could be insider trading. 

""This dude is a rising star on Wall Street,"" Gasparino joked before taking a serious tone. 

""Obviously this brings up the notion, is this insider trading? Is she giving him some tips? We should point out that the SEC and the DOJ have brought cases on insider tips via pillow talk. Trust me on this. It’s happened,"" he said. ""I don’t believe this hits the insider trading bar… a lot of information about this legislation was bouncing around, it has to be material, non-public, stolen, misappropriated. It kind of doesn’t hit those barriers. But what this does hit is limousine liberalism, arrogance on steroids."" "

Today, $NVDA released preliminary earnings report which was disappointing and it was expected, IMO. However, why did Nvidia not wait until Aug 24th for official report? Is there any reason, you can think of, that made Nvidia release preliminary earnings report just 2 weeks before official ER?

I like Nvidia, but I think it is currently overpriced, especially when Fed is hiking rates."

Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what analysts were expecting.

* **Revenue:** $6.7 billion versus $6.7 billion expected
* **Adj. EPS:** $0.51 versus $0.53 expected
* **Data Center:** $3.8 billion versus $3.8 billion expected
* **Gaming:** $2.0 billion versus $2.0 billion expected

Net income for the company fell 72% year-over-year to $656 million. Shares of Nvidia were down more than 2% following the announcement.

Nvidia also announced Q3 revenue projections that fell short of expectations, saying it will bring in $5.9 billion in the quarter. Wall Street was looking for $6.9 billion.

""We are navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment and we will get through this,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.

Nvidia released its preliminary earnings on Aug. 8, warnings investors that the company was going to miss on its own expectations for the quarter as gaming sales continued to plummet.

According to the company's numbers, gaming segment revenue dropped an eye-watering 33% year-over-year and 44% quarter-over-quarter. Fellow gaming companies including Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch)), Sony ([SONY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SONY?p=SONY&.tsrc=fin-srch)), Nintendo ([NTDOY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NTDOY?p=NTDOY&.tsrc=fin-srch)), and others have also reported a drop in game hardware spending."
2022-08-25 10:17:40,Fountainheadusa,NVIDIA - $NVDA Falling Gaming revenues in Q3 - Is it cheap enough to buy?," I own shares of $NVDA , and may buy some more on declines. I'm trying to get a handle on when gaming revenues may bottom. Even though, Q2 earnings were anticipated and matched revised estimates, the Q3 revenue guidance of $5.7Bn was way below consensus estimates of $6.7Bn.

A few takeaways from the earnings call.

They guided to 65% gross margins for Q3 - Given the weakness in ASP's for gamin chips - is it achievable?

I was trying to estimate Q3 gaming revenues.

From the earnings call

Analyst ""I guess, based on the guidance commentary, where I’ve come up thinking about would be like a 30-plus percent sequential decline in gaming""

CFO - ""And we do expect, yes, gaming to decrease, not in the dollar amount that it decreased between Q1 and Q2.Our Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2.""

Based on management's revenue estimate of $5.7Bn and the commentary above, I'm getting these estimates for Q3.

All Numbers in Millions.

Data Center - $3,871 - sequential growth of 3%  
Auto -$221 - sequential growth of 5%  
Viz - $500, the same as Q2  
OEM - $130, the same as Q2  
**GAMING - If $5,700 is the total then that leaves only - $1,000 for gaming, which is a sequential drop of 50%.**

Does that make sense?

**Alternatively, a sequential drop of 30% would put gaming at $1,428, then the revenue total goes to $6,100**

Sandbagging? Difficult to tell.

The markets are fairly sanguine about $NVDA's prospects , the stock is up 2% to $177 after falling to $164 in extended trading, I didn't see downward revisions.

I'm keen on picking up some if it declines another 5% from here, but that is looking difficult."

So I decided to cut my losses around $160. And here we are, back right to my purchase price.

I'm unsurprised by this article, mainly because after researching machine learning systems and platforms, I discovered that Nvidia is *the* leader in the field, and has been almost since its inception.  They lead the industry by about 6 years, and the gap appears to be widening rather than converging.  Pretty much every company that utilizes machine learning has Nvidia as its hardware platform- so that's not just ChatGPT, it's Google, Apple, Tesla, GM, all the big funds experimenting with machine learning trading and forecasting algorithms, pretty much everyone.  And this market is just getting bigger, faster.  People freaked out over gamers not buying because of inflated prices and miners offloading hardware they couldn't use anymore because of restrictions in China, but I was aware an underlying revenue stream was solid and prepared to widen.

After dropping more than 33% last year amid aggressive interest rate hikes and stubborn inflation, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite has recovered roughly 12% in 2023. Better than expected labor market data, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and optimism about a potentially dovish Federal Reserve have helped boost the beaten down sector. But Gene Munster, a veteran tech analyst and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, warned Monday that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could pop tech investors’ bubble this week. 

Fed Chair Powell will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday in his first public outing since a Feb. 7 interview with the private equity billionaire David Rubenstein that was largely interpreted as dovish by markets. He’s expected to discuss February’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes, where most Fed officials said they anticipated “ongoing” rate hikes and some even argued that recent labor market strength warrants a “tighter stance of monetary policy.”

Munster argued that Powell realized after his comments last month that if he is not “overly hawkish”—repeatedly doubling down on his inflation-fighting stance—every time he speaks, then markets interpret it as a sign that he will pause interest rate hikes or even pivot to cuts.

As a result, the tech analyst said that he expects to see Powell “retreat to his fallback position of a more hawkish tone” during the hearing. And a hawkish Fed is never good for tech stocks, which rely on low rates to invest in their growth and are often valued using the Fed’s benchmark interest rate."

Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv

Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates

Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.

Automotive revenue, Tesla’s core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.

Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.

The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.

Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.

Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.


Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management’s consideration were seeking updates on the company’s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company’s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.

In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.

A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.

According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.

Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

2023-04-26 04:20:59,picsit,Britain blocks Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard,"LONDON — Britain’s top competition regulator on Wednesday moved to block[ Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)’s acquisition of video game publisher [Activision Blizzard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ATVI/).

The  measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to  convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition.

Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision.

The  U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as  it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market.

Microsoft  could make Activision’s games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform,  Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the  space, the CMA said.

Cloud gaming is a technology that enables  gamers to access games via companies’ remote servers — effectively  streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is  still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a  mainstream way of playing games.

Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $69 billion, in [one of the biggest deals the video game industry has seen](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-buy-activision.html) to date.

Executives  at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the  acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative  franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content  offerings.

However, some of Microsoft’s competitors contested the  deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion  games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft [may shut off distribution access to Activision’s popular Call of Duty franchise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/16/microsoft-is-growing-tired-of-sonys-call-of-duty-complaints/?sh=bd568595ebb9) for certain platforms.

[Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP/), in particular, has voiced concern with Microsoft’s Activision purchase.  The Japanese gaming giant fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty  exclusive to its Xbox consoles in the long run. 

 Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)

and other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.

Microsoft  argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty  from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income  it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms.

Microsoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.

The CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring  new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release.

Cloud  gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over  the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband  connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm  Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic  in 2022.

Even with the CMA’s blessing, Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal. The EU [continues to probe the merger](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html) to assess whether it hurts competition, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission [sued to block the deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-game-giant-activision-blizzard.html) on antitrust grounds.

2023-05-18 21:07:33,ST530,Is there potential to short NVDA?,"I was taking a look at the general semiconductor industry and was surprised by the metrics of NVDA. The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. 

I also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.

I do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.

Seems that going short through ITM or ATM long dated puts seems legitimate. What do you guys think?


Update: I did see the +20% move after NVDA reported earnings. Luckily I did not open the short position yet. However, after briefly reading the filings I believe this could potentially be an even better short as valuation is more ridiculous"

2023-05-31 03:22:50,Different-Shake8462,Cathie Wood calls Nvidia stock 'overpriced' after missing 2023 rally,"Cathie Wood isn't buying the artificial intelligence hype at Nvidia (NVDA).  
  
The founder of Ark Invest, and noted tech innovation investor, tweeted on Monday that the AI darling is now overpriced.  


Nvidia shares have risen more than 30% since the company reported earnings on May 24, and the stock touched a $1 trillion dollar market cap on Tuesday.  
  
  
Wood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches.  
It hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading session.  
With the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) now up more than 2.5% in the last five days, Wood argues there are going to be other winners in the AI space outside of Nvidia.  
""Other companies with visionary leaders, strong global distribution and, perhaps most important, large-high-quality pools of proprietary data should be big #AI winners, with revenues and earnings surprising significantly on the high side of expectations during the years ahead,"" Wood tweeted.  
There will be ""dozens"" of AI winners, according to Wood. But the one that stands out to Ark, as it often does, is Tesla (TSLA).  
Wood argues that at six times revenue, Tesla stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's current 25 times revenue valuation.  
""(Tesla) is the most obvious beneficiary of the recent breakthroughs in #AI, as it aims for an $8-10 trillion revenue TAM in autonomous mobility by 2030,"" Wood wrote.  
With several positive headlines in the news of late including a growing relationship in China, Tesla shares are up more than 7% amid the broader tech rally.

  
Wood's Nvidia comments come as her flagship ETF, the Ark Innovation Fund (ARKK), has struggled to return to its pandemic dominance. The ETF skyrocketed during the risk-on bull market of 2020 with high-flying pandemic darlings like Tesla, Zoom (ZM), and even Nvidia contributing to gains.  
But as the Federal Reserve enacted its most aggressive interest rate hike campaign in four decades, risky bets became less popular with investors. Some of Ark's top holdings, such as Zoom, Roku (ROKU), and Coinbase (COIN) are well off their pandemic highs.  
The fund itself lost more than $1 billion in market cap in 2022 with shares falling nearly 67%."

A longtime board member at Nvidia Corp. dumped more than $48 million worth of the chip maker’s shares earlier this week, cashing in on the stock’s recent surge.  
  
Harvey Jones, who has been on the Nvidia NVDA, -0.80% board since 1993, sold nearly 120,000 shares of the company Tuesday at prices between $400 and $408.51, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made public Wednesday. He pocketed $48.3 million through the transaction, which took place with shares that he held in his living trust.

Jones, who is also the managing partner of private-investment entity Square Wave Ventures, holds 676,396 shares of Nvidia through the trust after Tuesday’s activity. He owns another 137,934 shares directly.  


The latest transaction by Jones follows a move by the Nvidia director to unload 70,205 shares at an average price of $405 on June 2, according to a filing from earlier in the month. He made over $28 million through that earlier burst of selling.  
  
Jones is reducing his Nvidia holdings as the stock has seen a massive run up so far this year, rising nearly 200% over that span. Nvidia recently became just the seventh U.S. public company to finish out a trading session with a market capitalization above $1 trillion, and it’s seen as a huge beneficiary of the growing fascination with artificial-intelligence technology.

2023-06-19 06:46:19,Auautheawesome,"Berlin, Intel strike deal on $33 billion chip plant after months of subsidy talks","BERLIN/STOCKHOLM, June 19 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O) will invest more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in Germany as part of its expansion push in Europe, the U.S. company said on Monday, a project key to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ambitions to create a global chip hub.  
  
The deal, which involves two leading-edge semiconductor facilities, involves 10 billion euros in German subsidies, a person familiar with the matter said.  
  
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said he was grateful to the German government and the local state of Saxony-Anhalt, where the company plans to built one plant, for ""fulfilling the vision of a vibrant, sustainable, leading-edge semiconductor industry in Germany and the EU"".  
  
Under Gelsinger, Intel (INTC.O) has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chipmaking and better compete with rivals AMD (AMD.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Samsung (005930.KS).  
  
The deal in Germany would be Intel's third big investment in four days, following a $4.6 billion chip plant in Poland and a $25 billion factory in Israel.  
  
Both the United States and Europe are trying to lure big industrial players via a mix of state subsidies and favourable legislation, with Berlin concerned about losing appeal as a place to invest.  
  
The German government is investing billions of euros in subsidies to lure tech companies to Germany amidst growing alarm over supply chain fragility and dependence on South Korea and Taiwan for chips.  
  
Berlin is currently also talking with Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) and Sweden's electric vehicle battery maker Northvolt about setting up production in Germany, having already convinced Tesla (TSLA.O) to build its first European gigafactory there.  
  
Frankfurt-listed Intel shares were 0.3% lower at 1316 GMT.  
  
The chipmaker last year announced plans to build a big chip complex in Germany, along with facilities in Ireland and France, as it seeks to benefit from the European Commission's eased funding rules and subsidies as the EU tries to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.  
  
It has not yet specified the exact size of the investment.  
  
Gelsinger told Reuters on Friday that the gap between what Germany had offered and what Intel needed was too big but he expected to reach an agreement, adding that his request was to be cost competitive.  
  
""We lost this industry to Asia, we have to be competitive if we're going to bring it back,"" he said, adding the overall investment for the site would be ""tens of billions of dollars"".

Nvidia shares have nearly tripled this year. Investors question whether the stock can live up to the hype.

The dot-com bubble taught investors to be wary of stock-market rallies powered by a technological boom—that is, until generative artificial intelligence sent tech stocks soaring this year.

Shares of Nvidia NVDA -0.39%, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the frenzy, have nearly tripled in 2023, while the Nasdaq-100 has climbed 38% and the S&P 500 has gained 16%.

For some investors, the surge in Nvidia—now the fifth-largest U.S. company by market value—is difficult to chalk up to anything but speculative mania. Its weighting in the benchmark stock indexes means everyday investors are at the whims of its trajectory, whether they believe in AI’s potential or not.

“There’s a huge boom in AI—some people are scrambling to get exposure at any cost, while others are sounding the alarm that this will end in tears,” said Kai Wu, founder and chief investment officer of Sparkline Capital. “Investors can benefit from innovation-led growth, but must be wary of overpaying for it.”

Nvidia is the primary producer of semiconductors backing artificial-intelligence systems. The company forecast a record $11 billion in sales for the recently ended quarter when it reported results in May, catching analysts off guard with the projected surge in customer demand.

“That’s when the excitement around AI really ramped up,” said Ryan McCormack, an Invesco senior exchange-traded fund strategist. 

The hype has driven companies such as Meta Platforms and Amazon.com that have been building out AI capabilities, he said. Shares of the tech giants are up 154% and 65% in 2023, respectively. Microsoft, which has climbed 35%, has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a chatbot that can answer difficult questions in seconds.

The furious rally in those stocks, long the market’s biggest drivers, has fanned worries about market concentration. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&P 500 now comprise more than a third of the market, according to Dow Jones Market Data. They represented 27% of the index at the start of the year and less than a quarter in 2000.

“The market story that rhymes most with the internet bubble is the concentration of leadership,” said Mike Edwards, deputy chief investment officer of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers.

Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings report, due Aug. 23, will provide insight into whether its inexorable rise is well-rooted in demand for chips, or a product of hype. The stock gained 24% in the trading session after its earnings reported in May, and 14% the day following February’s results.

Investors are paying up for the shares, betting on a windfall down the line. Nvidia is trading at 41 times its sales from the last 12 months, according to FactSet, compared with 2.4 times sales for the S&P 500. On a forward basis, the stock trades at 20 times its expected sales for the year ahead—double its average over the last decade of 10 times, according to Dow Jones Market Data. 

The nascency of AI programs such as ChatGPT means it is likely too early to determine whether Nvidia can raise revenue in line with the eye-watering valuation investors have slapped on its shares. If the company’s growth isn’t enough to reflect its price, the stock could crater.

A basket of 43 high-multiple internet stocks—those worth at least $5 billion that traded at 25 times their revenue at the turn of the century—crashed 80% over the next two years, according to Sparkline. 

The companies weren’t duds, either. Their sales grew 10-fold in the ensuing two decades. But investors were badly bruised from the bust: The shares returned an average of 16% in that time span. The S&P 500 returned 284%.

The basket included Amazon and Microsoft, both darlings of today’s market, along with Cisco Systems, then one of the largest companies in the Nasdaq-100. The networking- equipment maker traded as high as 38 times its sales in early 2000. Cisco has returned 43% since the start of the century—it is down 0.4% when excluding dividends.

“Valuations matter,” said Wu. “Investing in stocks exposed to rapidly growing technologies only works if the growth is not already priced in. Unfortunately, in periods of euphoria, the market has a tendency not only to price in potential growth, but to greatly overextrapolate it.”

One reason why this rally might lack the boom-and-bust nature of the dot-com bubble: The beneficiaries of artificial intelligence were the stocks already shining this year. Investors were flocking to big tech in the first quarter, seeking shelter in strong balance sheets and cash flows.

Tech companies are also benefiting from the expected end of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate campaign and resilient consumer spending. Cyclical sectors of the broader market have begun to catch up now that recession fears are fading. 

“It’s not like 1999 when investors were racing to hot IPOs for companies that had no chance of making money,” said Edwards. “Today’s winners are disciplined, enormous companies that have moats in place and data sets to exploit.”"

**ETFs:** VGT, VONG, VTI, SCHD, and SCHG

**Stocks** *(I bought fractions of these)*:  AAPL, AMZN, HD, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, O, RTX, WM, WMT

That was my attempt of diversifying.  I have been reading until my eyes bleed, and I really have no idea if what I'm doing is considered smart or not.  But for the first time, checking my portfolio today.. seeing I'm up 1.24% with everything in green (short of stupid Wal\*Mart)...  

I'm up a whopping $10!  And I think that's pretty cool!!!  Now how in the hell do I make that **bajillions**?

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

**1.** Tesla's battery supplier, Panasonic, cut vehicle battery output in Japan during the third quarter, decreasing its annual profit prediction by 15%. This was attributable to a worldwide slowdown in EV sales. Panasonic provides battery cells to Tesla's Nevada Gigafactory in the United States. However, the Japanese manufacturing drop had an impact on customers worldwide, not only in North America.  
  
**2.** ON Semiconductor revealed lower-than-expected profit and revenue guidance due to decreasing sales. ON Semiconductor manufactures silicon carbide chips used by Tesla in its EV powertrain and other important components. A decline in demand for these chips is viewed as a possible indicator of slowing EV sales, notably for Tesla.  
  
Tesla investor Gary Black said that the stock's downturn could be attributed to ON Semiconductor's -18% projection failure. This was owing to concerns about the increasing danger to vehicle demand caused by rising interest rates.  
  
Tesla shares have dropped roughly 22% in the last month, but are still **up 60% year to date.**

For those who don't know the Magnificent 7 are: **AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, NVDA.** With a combined market cap of **more than $11 trillion**, they currently make up approx. **29% of the S&P 500's market cap.** 

The 7 giants have gained **71%** so far this year while the rest of the 493 stocks included in the benchmark index have gained 6%. They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets. 

Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least. 

Now I know this is a ""stocks"" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&P 500 ETF.

So I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META & TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.

Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future. Nowdays it's as difficult as ever to overtake these giants, imo."

2024-01-25 14:17:40,_hiddenscout,Intel stock sinks as early 2024 outlook comes up short,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html)

Intel shares dropped in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker issued an outlook for the first quarter of 2024 that lagged analyst forecasts even as results for the latest quarter beat Wall Street estimates.  
  
Here’s how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December:  
  
Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected  
Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected

  
For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue.  
  
Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year.  
  
With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue.  
  
Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street.  
  
Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia’s recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs.  
  
Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips.  
  
Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022.  
  
Intel’s largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%.  
  
Intel’s second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs.  
  
Intel foundry services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase."
2024-01-30 14:15:31,Puginator,Q2 Earnings - Microsoft beats estimates as Azure grows faster than expected,"Here’s how the company performed, compared with consensus among analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings: $2.93 per share, vs. $2.78 per share expected

Revenue: $62.02 billion, vs. $61.12 billion expected

Microsoft’s revenue increased 17.6% year over year in the year, which ended on Dec. 31, according to a statement. Net income, at $21.87 billion, or $2.93 per share, increased from $16.43 billion, or $2.20 per share.

The company’s Intelligent Cloud segment produced $25.88 billion in revenue, up 20% and above the $25.29 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The grouping contains Azure cloud infrastructure, SQL Server, Windows Server, Nuance, GitHub and enterprise services.

Within that segment, revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30%. Analysts polled by CNBC had expected 27.7% growth, and the StreetAccount consensus was 27.5%. The metric for the previous quarter was 29%.

Revenue from the Productivity and Business Processes unit including Office productivity software, LinkedIn and Dynamics totaled $19.25 billion. That was up 13% and higher than the $18.99 billion StreetAccount consensus.

The More Personal Computing segment contributed $16.89 billion in revenue, up about 19% and more than the StreetAccount consensus of $16.79 billion. The segment comprises Windows, Surface, Bing and Xbox.

During the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft closed its acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, its largest deal ever. The company also announced custom cloud chips and started selling a $30 monthly Copilot artificial intelligence add-on to Microsoft 365 productivity software bundles.

But layoffs continued. Microsoft’s LinkedIn subsidiary cut around 700 jobs in October on top of the 10,000 announced earlier in the year. Last week, Microsoft said it’s eliminating around 1,900 employees in its gaming unit, or about 9% of headcount, following the Activision deal.

2024-01-31 17:45:47,mickdewgul,Two Big Differences Between AMD & NVDA,"I was digging deep into a lot of tech stocks on my watch lists and came across what I think are two big differences that separate AMD and NVDA from a margins perspective and a management approach.

Obviously, at the moment NVDA has superior technology and the current story for AMD's expected rise (an inevitable rise in the eyes of most) is that they'll steal future market share from NVDA. That they'll close the gap and capture billions of dollars worth of market share. Well, that might eventually happen, but I couldn't ignore these two differences during my research. 

The first is margins. NVDA is rocking an astounding 42% profit margin and 57% operating margin. AMD on the other hand is looking at an abysmal .9% profit margin and 4% operating margins. Furthermore, when it comes to management, NVDA is sitting at 27% of a return on assets and 69% return on equity while AMD posts .08% return on assets and .08% return in equity. Thats an insane gap in my eyes. 

Speaking to management there was another insane difference. AMD's president rakes home 6 million a year while the next highest paid person is making just 2 million. NVDA's CEO is making 1.6 million and the second highest paid employee makes 990k. That to me looks like greedy president on the AMD side versus a company that values it's second tier employees in NVDA. 

I've been riding the NVDA wave for nearly a decade now and have been looking at opening a defensive position in AMD, but those margins and the CEO salary disparity I found to be alarming at the moment. Maybe if they can increase their margins it'll be a buy for me, but waiting for a pull back until then and possibly a more company friendly President."

Big tech, Tesla, Bitcoin, NVDA, AMD, and many others. I remember trading msft around 50.00 share in 2015ish thinking this is a boring old PC company lol. 

While those stocks are still growing and going up they’re now discovered and mature in the cycle. What are some stocks that you think are at the beginning of the cycle that could set sail like the others we all know by now. The proverbial MSFTs at 50.00 or FB at ipo. And why do you see these as something we’ll see explode over the next decade?"

2024-02-12 09:36:29,EngRookie,Is the S&P500 still a safe bet atm?,"So as I'm sure many are aware a good portion of the growth in SP500 has been driven by the mag6/7 and the companies that support it.

My question is: If the majority of growth in an index that is supposed to represent the broader performance of the market is localized to the tech sector, is it still a safe(r) more reliable investment than individual stock picks in the tech sector? 

Will we see a market correction eventually as small and midsized cap companies aren't performing nearly as well as they are being portrayed? I just see everyone talking about hitting 5k for the first time but I'm like can we really consider this still an effective tool at measuring the broader performance of the market if 6/7 companies account for a min of 25% of total cap. I mean shouldn't we be normalizing the growth to reflect this? I thought the whole point was to measure the performance/health of 500 companies not 30 or less like the dow.

I guess the crux of my question is can we really say that investing in index funds like VOO or VTI is safe(r) or as safe of a bet as it used to be 20/30 years ago? What happens if one of the mag 6/7 goes down? We can't expect the US to continue trade tariff policies and funding/engaging in armed conflicts just to keep a company above foreign competition.

Edited to add: 

some of the comments have acknowledged the near-term risk, which is what I was getting at. I apologize for my question being poorly worded. I know that long term it is safe, but near term (next 1-3 years), am I making a better decision going with individual large cap tech stocks, and then once small and midsized caps start growing again selling and then re-investing in index funds, or spreading out my risk in an index funds now. I know this is all based on personal risk tolerance but I'm just looking to see how others are feeling 

*ATM= at the moment*

Second edit: I was corrected in that the SP500 is solely large cap. And that what I am really talking about is mega cap vs large cap. If I knew how to cross out text on mobile, I would correct it. But still my question remains, how can we include the performance statistics of stocks that are so far removed from the rest of the companies in the SP500? Are we putting too much emphasis on the growth of less than 10 companies when we are talking about the overall ""health of the economy"" ?(SP400 and SP600 are mid and small caps, respectively) 

Third edit: I was reminded that I should state my retirement timeline. At the earliest I'm saying 30 years conservatively (maybe 25 if im really lucky with investments and/or never have children) and 40 at the latest. I would also like to thank everyone for their advice on this as I have realized that I am letting past negative events cloud my judgement too much and that I am probably being impatient and I should just make continual investments in the market every month. And with looking at 20/30yr trends the market has always gone up so even if I had the absolute worst timing if I just keep investing in solid companies/funds by the time I reach retirement I will be set."
2024-02-13 07:09:52,waterlimes,What stocks do you think you'll be kicking yourself for not buying in 5 years time?,"So of course the market has been on a tear recently with the usual tech suspects like nvda powering the index. But what are some 'unloved names' now that aren't getting hype?

Usually the hype only starts after they've had a big run up. But to make real money you ideally get in before that. 

Personally, I think SE is compelling long term at these levels.

2024-02-14 17:14:14,Puginator,"Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company","Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. It’s the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker’s stock soaring.

Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google’s $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.

The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.

Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.

Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques — such as transformer architecture — used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.

Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a “code red” situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.

Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

2024-05-23 10:24:55,BigBrainGeometry,Made no money because I listened to my dad,"This is my dad: [https://imgur.com/a/YsNBJRM](https://imgur.com/a/YsNBJRM)

I began investing in 2017. I wanted to buy Apple and Microsoft, but he told me they were too high, and I should wait for a crash. And he wouldn't shut up about the coming crash. I guess I internalized what he was saying and ended up focusing on ""cheap"" stocks and ""value investing.""

7 years later, my portfolio is -5%.

I didn't have enough money to buy the dip in 2020 because all of my money was tied up in stuff like $WBA, $SPG, and $SJM. Lol.

Only these past two years, I started to shift strategies and buy good businesses with actual prospects. That's why I'm down only -5% rather than -35%.

I'm just ranting. I can't believe I wasted so much time researching ""undervalued"" companies and couldn't even beat cash interest. I'm only 29 at least, so hopefully I can still grow my portfolio. But I missed out on some of the best years of the S&P...

Oh yeah, I'm holding some NVDA and yesterday my dad was screaming at me to sell, and how it's too high, and ""it can't go up forever."" I was really annoyed, so I created the image above and sent it to him.

Oh, he also lost hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past 30 years. I grew up watching my parents fight over money all the time. Don't know why I ever listened to him.

I did make plenty of my own mistakes, of course. And it's ultimately my fault for following his advice. I think I've learned a lot so I don't feel as much of a need to rely on other people anymore. I guess I'm just really annoyed that he's still saying the same thing as he did back then.

OK, thanks for listening to my venting. "

It also just so happens that Tesla’s FSD is powered by Nvdia’s chips. TSLA shares angled lower Thursday.

""Tesla is far ahead in self-driving cars but every single car someday will have to have autonomous capability,"" Huang told Yahoo Finance Wednesday night. 

""One of the things that's really revolutionary about version 12 of Tesla's full self-driving is that it's an end-to-end generative model,"" Huang added. ""It learns from watching videos — surround video — and it learns about how to drive end-to-end, and using generative AI, predict the path and how to understand and how to steer the car. So the technology is really revolutionary and the work that [Tesla’s] doing is incredible.""

2024-05-25 06:17:13,PartyNightAway,How did people find out about NVDA?,i’m kind of new to investing and I’ve been browsing other subreddits. The stock NVDA keeps popping up pretty frequently. I saw a post where several people said they bought the stock for $150 or $250 and now it is well over 1K. My question is how did people find out about this stock and why did they think it was going to do so great? Can someone fill me in.
2024-05-26 11:41:26,nams0,"Realistically, how high can NVDA actually go at this point?","Currently Nvidia has a market cap of 2.62T, making it the 3rd largest market cap company in US. This follows Microsoft at 3.19T and Apple at 2.91T. If Nvidia were to become #1 in market cap, which looks like that's going to happen soon, that would be about 22% increase in its stock price. But beyond that, how realistic is it for this company to keep growing up to 4T market cap and beyond? Are the prospects seriously that good? To hit 4T, Nvidia stock would need to rise by another 50%. I just can't see how that is going to happen. How can Nvidia, which really is just a company that makes GPUs and drives, end up being more valuable than Microsoft, Apple, and Google in the long term? Nvidia has a fantastic business model and ridiculous profit margins, but it still seems unrealistic to me for it's share price to keep growing and growing to a record high market cap at this point.

My gut feels like there is far too much hype surrounding Nvidia's prospects and price should drop a fair bit. I think it's too risky to buy in now and that after the stock split we will start seeing a correction. Thoughts?

edit: Lol what's with the downvotes? Are we not allowed to have open discussions?"

Salesforce called for adjusted earnings per share in the current quarter of $2.34 to $2.36 on $9.2 billion to $9.25 billion in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected $2.40 in adjusted earnings per share on $9.37 billion in revenue.

Revenue in the fiscal first quarter, which ended April 30, increased 11% from $8.25 billion a year earlier, Salesforce said in a statement. Net income jumped to $1.53 billion, or $1.56 per share, from $199 million, or 20 cents per share a year ago.

2024-06-09 08:11:21,Think_Ad8198,Bear Case: Why I believe Alphabet will do everything right and still lose,"Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors, but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue.

With the ""Attention is all you need"" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch.

But even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift.

Much of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo.

Ultimately, Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive, but without a massive moat in a crucial industry, it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META, MSFT, and NVDA."

2024-06-17 10:15:52,StatQuants,"Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund","KEY POINTS

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)’s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday’s close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia’s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

“Understanding how they might be weighted, where they’re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what’s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,” Bartolini said.

The fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.

The free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.

“Its free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,” Bartolini said.

The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.

On Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.

Agencies and staff reporter

Nvidia said it was on track to ramp up production of its most advanced artificial intelligence chip, following reports of a delay in its launch due to design flaws.

Tech journal The Information had reported that design flaws on its new Blackwell chip could cause a delay of three months or more and the setback could affect customers such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft, which have collectively ordered tens of billions of US dollars' worth of chips.

The chip giant's Blackwell series succeeds its earlier flagship AI chip, the Grace Hopper Superchip.

In response, a Nvidia spokesman said ""Hopper demand is very strong, broad Blackwell sampling has started, and production is on track to ramp in the second half."""

2024-08-13 14:03:15,Fidler_2K,Bloomberg: US Considers a Rare Antitrust Move: Breaking Up Google,"A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.’s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.

The move would be Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.

Regardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google’s web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said.

The Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta’s Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government’s proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request.

Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses.

A Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment.

The US plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s.

Justice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google’s practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company’s search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google’s AI products in order to appear in search results.

**Breakup**

Divesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that’s been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store.

Those agreements also require that Google’s search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can’t be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found.

Mehta’s decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn’t yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn’t be allowed “to reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.”

Google paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc.

Mehta’s ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google’s total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year’s trial.

If the Justice Department doesn’t call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said.

**Data Access**

Another option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft’s Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta’s ruling found that Google’s contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data – 16 times as much as its next closest competitor — but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively.

Europe’s recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds.

Requiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department’s first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents.

In the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other.

**AI Products**

For years, websites have allowed Google’s web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company’s search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI.

Last fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn’t apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with “AI Overviews,” narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web.

Google doesn’t allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a “feature” of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews.

While AI Overviews only appear on a fraction of searches, the feature’s roll-out has been rocky after some excerpts offered embarrassing suggestions, like advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza.

1. It doesn't matter for long term investors (wouldn't it be better to keep your number as it is than to have it drop a few %?)
2. The past is not an indicator of the future (even though that does seem to be a strong trend?)
3. You may miss out on a possible positive return (I think this relates to the issue of ""trying to time the market"" which I would find valid for long term investors.)

2024-09-14 07:58:14,foo-bar-nlogn-100,NVDA Bear Case | AI Bubble Collapse | Falsifying the Scalability Hypothesis | Thematics,"# Background

 The AI scaling hypothesis is a key concept in artificial intelligence research that suggests improvements in AI capabilities can be achieved primarily by increasing the size and computational resources of AI models. We can understand several aspects of this hypothesis:

Key Points of the AI Scaling Hypothesis

1. **Emergence of Capabilities**: As AI models grow larger and are trained on more data, they tend to develop new capabilities that were not explicitly programmed. This emergence of novel abilities is a central tenet of the scaling hypothesis.
2. **Generalization**: Larger models demonstrate improved ability to generalize across different tasks and domains, often showing surprising competence in areas they were not specifically trained for.
3. **Efficiency in Learning**: Scaled-up models can learn more efficiently from limited data, sometimes matching or surpassing the performance of smaller, task-specific models with just a few examples.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: The hypothesis suggests that continuing to scale up models will lead to further improvements in AI performance and capabilities, potentially approaching or even surpassing human-level abilities in various domains.

# Hyperscalers and First Mover Advantage

The scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind many recent advancements in AI, including large language models and multimodal AI systems. However, it's important to note that while scaling has proven effective, it also comes with challenges such as increased computational requirements and potential biases in large datasets.

Hyperscalers are racing to scale their AI capabilities and be ***the first to discover emergent properties for several compelling reasons at any cost. This is the main driver in the billions of capital expenditures over the last 18 months.*** At the forefront is the significant competitive advantage that comes with pioneering new AI capabilities in the fast-evolving tech landscape. Being first allows these companies to establish market dominance, attract and retain customers seeking cutting-edge AI solutions, and gain valuable insights from early deployments. This advantage is not merely about prestige; it translates directly into substantial economic benefits.

The economic incentives driving this race are staggering. Industry projections suggest that AI technology in data centers alone could drive spending of up to $2 trillion over the next five years. Additionally, the AI silicon market is expected to reach $400 billion by 2027. These figures underscore the massive financial opportunity that awaits those who lead in AI capabilities. Hyperscalers are positioning themselves to capitalize on the growing demand for custom AI silicon and infrastructure, potentially securing a significant share of this burgeoning market.

The rush to scale is also fueled by the promise of technological breakthroughs. ***The AI scaling hypothesis suggests that continued increases in model size and computational resources will lead to the emergence of novel capabilities not explicitly programmed, improved generalization across different tasks and domains, and more efficient learning from limited data***\*.\* This potential for transformative advancements keeps hyperscalers intensely focused on pushing the boundaries of AI scale.

Hyperscalers are uniquely positioned in this race due to their existing infrastructure advantages. They possess the necessary computational resources, data centers, and cloud infrastructure that can be leveraged for AI training and deployment. This allows them to offer scalable AI services to a wide range of customers, from individuals to large enterprises, further cementing their market position.

Strategically, leading in AI capabilities allows hyperscalers to shape the future direction of AI development and applications, influence industry standards, and attract top AI talent and research partnerships. The potential for breakthrough discoveries, including the possibility of approaching or surpassing human-level abilities in various domains or even developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), adds another layer of motivation to their efforts.

# Falsifying the Scalability Hypothesis

The AI scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind many recent advancements in artificial intelligence, but there are compelling arguments for how it could potentially be falsified

One primary method would be ***to demonstrate diminishing returns as models are scaled up in size and computational resources.*** ***If performance gains plateau or even decline rather than continuing to improve linearly or superlinearly, it would suggest fundamental limits to scaling***. This could be coupled with identifying qualitative gaps – cognitive abilities or tasks that larger models consistently fail at, even as they improve on other benchmarks. Such findings would indicate that some fundamental capabilities are missing and cannot be addressed by pure scaling alone.

# Simple Bench

Simple bench is the only reasoning benchmark written in natural language at which English-speaking humans (and yes, even 'smart highschoolers') can score 90%+, while frontier LLMs get less than 50%. It is an encapsulation of the reasoning deficit found in AI like ChatGPT.

 What the benchmark does is take a standard kind of logic puzzle that people ask LLM's, then spikes it with a ""surprise twist"" that requires what we would think of as common sense.  Thus an AI has more difficulty in predicting the next tokens because of the twist.  But humans can still reason out an answer.

These questions are fully private, preventing contamination, and have been vetted by PhDs from multiple domains, as well as the author - Philip, from AI Explained - who first exposed the numerous errors in the MMLU (Aug 2023). \[https://simple-bench.com/about.html\]

***These large AI companies don’t disclose training parameter sizes because we can graph training size vs benchmark score to falsify the scalability hypothesis.***

The AI scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind significant advancements in artificial intelligence, propelling the development of increasingly powerful models and fueling a race among hyperscalers to achieve breakthrough capabilities. This hypothesis has led to remarkable improvements in AI performance across various domains, from natural language processing to computer vision and beyond.

However, as we delve deeper into the realm of large-scale AI models, we are beginning to encounter signs that suggest the scaling hypothesis may have limitations. The emergence of benchmarks like Simple Bench, which reveal persistent reasoning deficits in even the most advanced language models, indicates that simply increasing model size and computational resources may not be sufficient to achieve human-level reasoning capabilities.

The reluctance of major AI companies to disclose training parameter sizes for their latest models adds another layer of intrigue to this discussion. ***This lack of transparency makes it challenging for the broader scientific community to accurately assess the relationship between model scale and performance, potentially hindering efforts to validate or falsify the scaling hypothesis.***

Moreover, the increasing costs associated with training and deploying ever-larger models, coupled with concerns about data scarcity and computational limitations, raise questions about the long-term sustainability of the scaling approach. As we approach these practical and theoretical limits, it becomes clear that the future of AI advancement may require more than just scaling up existing architectures.

Looking ahead, the field of AI research may need to pivot towards more innovative approaches that focus on qualitative improvements in model architecture, training methodologies, and data utilization. The development of more sophisticated benchmarks, like Simple Bench, that can effectively measure complex reasoning abilities will be crucial in guiding these efforts.

Ultimately, while the scaling hypothesis has undoubtedly driven remarkable progress in AI, its limitations are becoming increasingly apparent. The next frontier in AI research may lie not in building ever-larger models, but in developing more efficient, adaptable, and truly intelligent systems that can match or exceed human-level reasoning across a wide range of tasks. This shift could lead to a new paradigm in AI development, one that combines the insights gained from scaling with novel approaches to create more capable and robust artificial intelligence.

# AI Bubble Collapse and Trillions in Misallocated Capital

 The AI scaling hypothesis has been the cornerstone of recent advancements in artificial intelligence, driving unprecedented investments and fueling a race among tech giants to build ever-larger models. However, as we stand on the precipice of a potential paradigm shift, the falsification of this hypothesis could trigger a seismic disruption in the AI industry, potentially leading to the collapse of what many now recognize as an AI bubble.

The signs of this impending crisis are becoming increasingly apparent. Benchmarks like Simple Bench are exposing critical reasoning deficits in even the most advanced language models, defying the expectation that larger models inherently lead to more intelligent systems. The reluctance of major AI companies to disclose training parameter sizes for their latest models further fuels suspicion that the relationship between scale and performance may not be as straightforward as once believed.

 As the evidence mounts against the scaling hypothesis, we must confront the sobering reality of the potential misallocation of trillions of dollars in capital. Hyperscalers and investors have poured vast resources into the development of massive data centers, custom AI chips, and enormous models, all predicated on the belief that bigger is inherently better. If this foundational assumption proves false, the repercussions will be far-reaching and profound.

The collapse of the AI bubble, triggered by the falsification of the scaling hypothesis, could lead to:

1.  A dramatic reassessment of the valuations of AI-focused companies, potentially wiping out billions in market capitalization.

2.  A crisis of confidence in the AI industry, leading to a sharp decline in investment and a potential ""AI winter.""

**This potential collapse serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of putting too much faith in a single hypothesis**, no matter how compelling it may seem. It underscores the critical importance of diverse approaches in AI research and the need for rigorous, independent verification of claims made by industry leaders.

2024-09-20 08:12:40,foo-bar-nlogn-100,NVDA Bear Case | AI Bubble Collapse | Financial Round Tripping | Thematics,"# Background

It's crucial to understand the concept of financial round-tripping and its implications for the market. Round-tripping is a deceptive practice that has gained notoriety in recent years due to its potential to mislead investors and manipulate financial statements. This fraudulent technique involves creating artificial transactions between two or more entities to inflate revenues, evade taxes, or present a false picture of financial health.

Typically, round-tripping occurs when a company sells an asset to another entity while simultaneously agreeing to buy back the same or a similar asset at approximately the same price. This creates the illusion of bustling business activity and growth, which can be particularly attractive to speculative investors. However, these transactions lack genuine economic substance and violate the fundamental accounting principle of substance over form. Round-tripping has been implicated in several high-profile financial scandals, including those involving energy traders like Enron and CMS Energy, as well as financial service providers such as Wirecard. As an investment advisor, it's essential to be vigilant and look for red flags that might indicate round-tripping, such as unusually high revenue growth without corresponding increases in cash flow or profit margins.

**The practice of major tech companies providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting growth in datacenter and AI usage can indeed be viewed as a form of financial round-tripping**. This strategy raises significant concerns about the authenticity of reported revenue growth, as it creates a cycle where investments return as revenue, inflating metrics without genuine market expansion.

# History of Financial Round Tripping in Tech

 Over the past 20 years, several high-profile cases of round-tripping have emerged in the technology sector, highlighting the prevalence of this deceptive practice. Here are some notable examples:

# Enron Scandal (2001)

While not strictly a tech company, Enron's collapse involved significant round-tripping in energy trading. The company engaged in numerous sham transactions with special purpose entities to inflate revenues and hide debt. These transactions involved selling assets to these entities and then buying them back at similar prices, creating the illusion of bustling business activity.

# Global Crossing (2002)

This telecommunications company was accused of swapping network capacity with other carriers to artificially boost revenue. Global Crossing would sell capacity on its network to another carrier while simultaneously buying an equal amount of capacity from that carrier, with no money changing hands. This practice inflated reported revenues without generating actual cash flow.

# Qwest Communications (2002-2004)

The telecom giant was found to have engaged in round-trip transactions involving the swapping of fiber-optic capacity with other companies. These deals were structured to appear as legitimate sales and purchases, but in reality, they were designed to inflate revenues artificially.

# Computer Associates (2004)

The software company was involved in a $2.2 billion accounting fraud that included round-tripping. They used a practice called the ""35-day month,"" where they kept their books open for an extra few days to record additional revenue from the next quarter, creating a perpetual cycle of inflated earnings.

# Nortel Networks (2007)

The Canadian telecommunications equipment manufacturer was found to have engaged in various accounting irregularities, including round-tripping. They manipulated revenue recognition by recording sales to distributors as final sales, even when the products were likely to be returned.

# Wirecard (2020)

While not exclusively a tech company, Wirecard was a major player in digital payment processing. The company was found to have engaged in massive fraud, including round-tripping transactions. They created fake customer accounts and used a network of partner companies to simulate legitimate business activities, inflating their reported revenues and cash balances.

These examples demonstrate that round-tripping has been a persistent issue in the tech sector, often used to artificially inflate revenues, manipulate stock prices, and deceive investors. The complex nature of technology businesses and their often intangible assets can make it easier to engage in such deceptive practices. However, increased regulatory scrutiny and improved auditing practices have made it more challenging for companies to engage in round-tripping without detection. 

# AI Labs Round Tripping

 

The practice of major tech companies providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting growth in datacenter and AI usage can indeed be viewed as a form of financial round-tripping. This strategy raises significant concerns about the authenticity of reported revenue growth, as it creates a cycle where investments return as revenue, inflating metrics without genuine market expansion.

# Artificial Inflation of Revenue

When tech giants invest in AI startups or provide them with datacenter credits, they essentially create a loop where their initial financial outlay returns to them as revenue. This cycle artificially inflates their cloud and AI service usage metrics, presenting an illusion of robust growth. For example, companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) have invested billions in AI firms like Anthropic, which then become major consumers of AWS's cloud services. This arrangement leads to an inflated perception of demand for these services, despite the fact that the growth is internally generated rather than stemming from new market participants.

# Lack of Economic Substance

These transactions often lack real economic substance because the AI labs are primarily spending money provided by the tech companies themselves. This means that instead of attracting new, independent customers or generating fresh revenue streams, the tech companies are simply cycling their own funds back into their revenue reports. Such practices can mislead stakeholders into believing that there is a substantial increase in market demand when, in reality, the growth is not driven by external factors.

# Misleading Market Perception

# Inflated Growth Figures

By reporting increased usage of their cloud and AI services due to these internal transactions, tech companies create a misleading picture of sector growth. This self-generated growth does not reflect broader market demand but rather a strategic manipulation to enhance financial statements. As highlighted by industry analysts, this practice can give an impression of thriving business activity that may not exist.

# Skewed Competition Metrics

This practice also distorts the competitive landscape by making it appear that certain companies are outperforming others in attracting AI business. In reality, these companies are subsidizing usage through investments and credits, which can skew competition metrics and obscure true market dynamics.

# Financial Interdependence

The symbiotic relationship created between tech giants and AI labs through these arrangements can lead to reduced innovation. AI labs may become overly reliant on specific cloud providers for resources, limiting their ability to explore diverse technological solutions. Additionally, this interdependence can result in conflicts of interest in the development and deployment of AI technologies, as the success of the startups becomes closely tied to the continued support from their benefactor companies.

# Regulatory and Accounting Concerns

# Revenue Recognition Issues

Questions arise regarding how these transactions should be accounted for. If a company invests in an AI startup and subsequently recognizes revenue from that startup's usage of its services, it creates a complex accounting situation that may not accurately reflect the company's true financial position. This ambiguity opens up potential for manipulation, as companies could use these arrangements to meet growth targets or analyst expectations.

# Potential for Manipulation

The practice opens the door for potential manipulation of financial statements. Companies might engage in these arrangements to artificially boost reported revenues, thereby meeting or exceeding market expectations without actual underlying business growth.

# Market Distortion

This practice can lead to a distorted view of the AI and cloud computing markets. By overestimating market size and growth rates based on inflated projections from round-tripping deals, resources may be misallocated. This could potentially create an AI bubble driven by circular investments rather than genuine demand. 

# Conclusion

In conclusion, while providing resources to AI labs can drive innovation, the current practice of offering datacenter credits and reporting resulting usage as growth shares similarities with financial round-tripping. It raises significant concerns about transparency, authenticity in corporate reporting, and potential distortions in market perceptions within the AI and cloud computing sectors.

# TLDR;

The practice of tech giants providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting the resulting usage as growth is essentially a modern form of financial round-tripping. This deceptive cycle artificially inflates revenue and usage metrics, creating a false perception of market demand. It distorts the competitive landscape, potentially stifles innovation, and raises serious regulatory concerns. Most alarmingly, it could be fueling an AI bubble based on circular investments rather than genuine market growth. Investors and regulators should be wary of this practice, as it may be masking the true state of the AI and cloud computing markets, potentially leading to misallocation of resources and inflated valuations in the tech sector."

""Blackwell is in full production,"" Huang said Wednesday during an interview with CNBC. ""Blackwell is as planned, and the demand for Blackwell is insane. Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.""


The Blackwell GPUs are already being released to data centers and industrial customers for artificial intelligence applications. They will be available for consumers in 2025.


""The thing that we have done with Blackwell, and what we have announced, is there is new Al infrastructure generation every year,"" Huang said. ""So, we're updating our platform every single year. If we can increase the performance, like we've done for Hopper and Blackwell ... we're effectively increasing the revenue or throughput for our customers on these infrastructures by a couple to three times each year.""


Hyperscalers are expected to spend about $160B in 2024 on Al infrastructure. Every frontier large language model requires many times more compute power than the one prior.


""At a time when technology is moving so fast, it gives us an opportunity to triple down and to really drive the innovation cycle so that we can increase capabilities, increase our throughput, decrease our costs, decrease our energy consumption,"" Huang added."

Current P/E, P/S and most metrics point to stellar growth expectations. If that's the case, why is $200 Call for June 2026 priced 'just' at $15. $240 Call (double of current price) is trading at $10.

[NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Options Chain - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/options/?date=1781740800) 

It's an almost certainty that NVDA should double in next 18 months, or even sooner. So why wouldn't someone just get this option for $10, and free up his $110 capital for something else?

I know, the option can become worthless if price stays below $240. But if I am getting into something as volatile as NVDA, I'm looking to 2X my capital; and not 'normal' 20-30% gains. So, isn't it better to just ""throw"" $10 at NVDA option, if the end-result is basically the same as investing $120 in it?"

TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales. If TSMC reports strong earnings, it could indicate robust demand for semiconductors, which is crucial since NVIDIA relies heavily on TSMC for manufacturing its GPUs. Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA.

Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may *revise* their ratings or ***price targets*** for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a **spike** in NVDA’s stock price. 

Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors. Reports indicate that TSMC is now able to ship more chips than ever before.

Do you believe TSMC’s earnings will positively impact NVIDIA? Are you planning to make any moves based on this news? Let’s discuss!

*On October 24, 2024, Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) sent the members of the Audit Committee a letter of resignation as the Company’s registered public accounting firm (the “Resignation Letter”).*  
  
*The Chair of the Audit Committee discussed with EY the reasons for EY’s resignation. The Company has begun the process of identifying a successor independent registered public accounting firm. The Company will authorize EY to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor independent registered public accounting firm, once selected. The Company does not currently expect that resolution of any of the matters raised by EY, or under consideration by the Special Committee, as noted below, will result in any restatements of its quarterly reports for the fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, or for prior fiscal years.*  
  
*EY was engaged on March 15, 2023 to perform an audit for the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, and has not issued any report on the Company’s financial statements or the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. EY resigned while conducting the audit for the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, EY’s first audit on the Company’s behalf.*  
  
*In late July 2024, EY communicated to the Audit Committee concerns about several matters relating to governance, transparency and completeness of communications to EY, and other matters pertaining to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and that the timely filing of the Company’s annual report was at significant risk. In response, the Board appointed an independent special committee of the Board (the “Special Committee”) to review the matters and certain of the Company’s internal controls and certain governance procedures (the “Review”). The Special Committee engaged Cooley LLP, and forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors, LLC to perform an investigation on behalf of and at the direction of the Special Committee. EY and the Board received updates with preliminary information relating to the Review. As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Review remains ongoing and final findings and recommendations have not yet been communicated to EY or the Board.*  
  
*After receiving additional information through the Review process, EY informed the Special Committee that the additional information EY received raised questions, including about whether the Company demonstrates a commitment to integrity and ethical values consistent with Principle 1 of the COSO Framework, about the ability and willingness of the Audit Committee and overall Board to demonstrate and act as an oversight body that is independent of the CEO and other members of management in accordance with Principle 2 of the COSO Framework, and whether EY could rely on representations from certain members of management and from the Audit Committee. In the Resignation Letter, EY stated, in part: “we are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.”*  
  
*Although the Company recognizes EY’s decision is final, it disagrees with EY’s decision to resign as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm – the Special Committee has not yet obtained all information relevant for the Review and has not concluded the Review. Nevertheless, the Company has taken the concerns expressed by EY seriously, and will carefully consider the findings of the Special Committee and any remedial or other actions recommended by the Special Committee following conclusion of the Review.*  
  
*Other than as described above, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the subsequent interim period preceding EY’s resignation, (1) there were no “disagreements,” as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, with EY on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which if not resolved to EY’s satisfaction to our knowledge would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter thereof in connection with its report, and (2) there were no “reportable events” as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.*  
  
*The Company has provided EY with a copy of the disclosures required by Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K contained in Item 4.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and has requested that EY furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the Company’s statements made in response to those requirements and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of EY’s letter, dated October 29, 2024, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.*"

2024-10-31 17:44:41,Puginator,Amazon CEO pledges AI investments will pay off as capital expenditures surge 81%,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is trying to reassure investors who may be worried about the future payoff of the company’s massive investments in generative artificial intelligence.

On a conference call with analysts following the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Thursday, Jassy pointed to the success of Amazon’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, which has become a crucial profit engine despite the extreme costs associated with building data centers.

“I think we’ve proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business,” Jassy said. “We expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI.”

Amazon spent $22.6 billion on property and equipment during the quarter, up 81% from the year before. Jassy said Amazon plans to spend $75 billion on capex in 2024 and expects an even higher number in 2025.

The jump in spending is primarily being driven by generative AI investments, Jassy said. The company is rushing to invest in data centers, networking gear and hardware to meet vast demand for the technology, which has exploded in popularity since OpenAI released its ChatGPT assistant almost two years ago.

“It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity,” Jassy said. “And I think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long term that we’re aggressively pursuing it.”

AI spending was a big topic on tech earnings calls this week. Meta on Wednesday raised its capital expenditures guidance, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was “quite happy” with the team’s execution. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI weighed on its fiscal first-quarter earnings released on Wednesday, and the company said capital spending would continue to rise. A day earlier, Alphabet CFO Anat Ashkenazi warned the company expects capital spending to grow in 2025.

Amazon has said its cloud unit has picked up more business from companies that need infrastructure to deploy generative AI models. It’s also launched several AI products for enterprises, third-party sellers on its marketplace and advertisers in recent months. The company is expected to announce a souped-up version of its Alexa voice assistant that incorporates generative AI, something Jassy said will arrive “in the near future.”

Amazon hasn’t disclosed its revenue from generative AI, but Jassy said Thursday it’s become a “multi-billion-dollar revenue run rate” business within AWS that “continues to grow at a triple-digit year-over-year percentage.”

“It’s growing more than three times faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew, and we felt like AWS grew pretty quickly,” he added.

1. Beijing has previously expressed desire to urgently switch away from NVDA chips and invest locally. Obviously that's easier said than done, but with China being such a huge market for NVDA, increased tensions over tariffs could push this mandate further. The amount of revenue NVDA gets from China has already decreased, but this further deceleration could be negative. [https://archive.is/v40zX](https://archive.is/v40zX)

*″*As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,” an AMD representative said in a statement. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.”

AMD had 26,000 employees at the end of last year, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

AMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

AMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers, including the MI300X, which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

AMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD’s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.

GPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD’s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

AMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research.

I understand Palantir has a lot of positive momentum from AI hype, expected defense spending under Trump, and general recovery of growth stocks as interest rates fall from their highs. These are all valid reasons to expect continued success from Palantir, but are investors irrationally exuberant?

Do you see a pullback on the horizon?"
