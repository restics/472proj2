NVDA - strong sustained performance. New architecture could lift them even more. However..it went up so much..im not sure if they will explode more.

ARMH - good future. smartphones are here to stay. i owned ARMH when they were 20$.. sold.. ..oh well

AMD - they can't stay at these levels. even though they compete with both nvda and intc..i believe that they should go up. they have some interesting architectures coming up (Zen and the 32 core chip for next year)

INTC - slowed down a bit..especially since they can;t really make a huge play in mobile ..however still a good value stock right ?

I (stupidly) bought two shares of $NVDA on Monday at $62.72 because I thought it would continue rising as it did on the Friday prior (this was the first stock I ever bought so I definitely learned from this mistake).

It now appears to be dropping more and more every day and my question is this: do you guys think I should hold it for the long term, OR should I sell it now, accept the ~$3 loss, and then buy in again when it drop to the mid $50s and then hold?

UPDATE: I probably should have mentioned that I'm a college student with a part time job and I'm trying to learn more about the stock market. This is why I only bought two shares. That is all."
2016-09-18 18:08:51,erichisalurker,NVDA DD feel free to critique,"Nvidia’s foundational revenue stream is in its gaming-oriented PC GPU products.  Despite diversification into other market segments, this product division remains the largest revenue-generator for Nvidia. Over the last six quarters, gaming-related products have accounted for more than 50% of sales revenue for the company. However, this relative share of revenue has declined as Nvidia has expanded into other product areas. Since their Q1 2016 report (4-26-2015), revenue streams from Datacenter and Automotive products have increased by 71.6% and 54.55% respectively. Nvidia also generates a significant portion of its revenues from Professional Visualization and OEM & IP products as well. Combined, these segments represent roughly 25% of Nvidia’s revenue. It is worth noting that over the last six quarters the revenue generated from OEM & IP products has declined 25.22% while the revenue from Professional Visualization products has increased by 18.2%


Regionally, Nvidia still derives most of its revenue from the Asia Pacific markets. In Q2 2017 (7-31-2016), revenue in the Asia Pacific region accounted for 66.67% of overall revenue. This is compared to 14.42% from the US, 11.69% from Europe, and 7.21% from Other Americas. There has been stable revenue growth from every region over the last six quarters, keeping in line with the growth in overall revenue. The largest regional growth can be seen in the Asia Pacific and United States regions, indicating improving consumer demand in both of these areas.


Having recognized the declines in relative revenue generation from video game segments, Nvidia has shifted their focus moving forward to larger-scale, more innovative market segments. At Nvidia’s GTC China 2017 presentation, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang highlighted the massive impact that deep learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will have on the world in the coming years. Nvidia seeks to push the boundaries of AI and deep learning technologies, and their first step is with their new GPU architecture, Pascal. Nvidia’s latest line of GPUs for both consumer and commercial use have been hailed as the best performing processors on the market. Furthermore, during the Q2 2017 earnings call, Huang reiterated his belief that deep learning is going to be the company’s most significant growth driver moving forward. Nvidia has very recently procured a contract with Chinese web company Baidu to develop AI platforms for their self-driving cars, adding their name to a client list which already includes industry leaders such as Tesla and BMW. A recent Bank of America forecast suggested that the deep learning and AI market could reach $153 billion by 2020, and Nvidia already has a strong position in the industry. 
	

Nvidia has very strong fundamentals currently. Over the last seven years, Nvidia has reported positive revenue and net income. Both of these metrics have seen substantial growth as costs have been reduced and profit margins have improved. Since 2010 both the total assets and total capital available have nearly doubled to $7370 million and $4580 million respectively. Nvidia has also seen substantial improvements in its ROA, ROC, and ROE. As of FY2016 reporting, ROA is 10.59%, ROC is 17.04%, and ROE is 17.46%. It is estimated that in FY2017, Nvidia will see revenue of $6098 million (12.12% increase from FY2016), net income of $1381.4 million (41.8% increase), and an EPS of $2.30 (67.9% increase). 
	

Nvidia’s TTM P/E ratio is currently sitting at 38.28 compared to an industry average of 15.2 and has a P/BV ratio of 7.51 compared to an industry average of 2.7. Normally these may indicate that the stock is overvalued, however Nvidia is seemingly at the forefront of a huge growth phase in an emerging industry and it appears that the market has priced this future growth in. In the coming months we should see a reduction in the P/E ratio due to higher EPS levels. As of their latest reporting, Nvidia has a current ratio of 2.56. This shows a lot fundamental strength for Nvidia to meet and short-term liabilities. Nvidia’s FY2016 profit margin was 15.58%, and impressive number alongside an equally impressive ROE of 17.46%. 
	

Given current fundamentals, Nvidia will be able to see a growth rate of 11.1%. This number is based on an equally-weighted average between the company’s Long-Run Growth Rate (10.90%) as shown on the company’s Bloomberg Terminal page and the Sustainable Growth Rate (11.28%) derived from the following formula: (ROE*b)/[1-(ROE*b)] where ROE is the company’s return on equity for the previous fiscal year and b is the retention ratio for the company. Nvidia’s current WACC is 12.5%, which is used as a benchmark for required return. Based on these two values and Nvidia’s returns over the last six years, Nvidia has an implied value of $46,827.67 million when using an earnings power valuation model. With 535 million shares outstanding, this implies a stock price of $87.52 per share. At the closing price of $62.84 on Sept. 16, there is a margin of safety of 28%. 
	

In spite of the huge returns Nvidia has already seen this year, I believe that it still has huge upside potential and would be a fantastic long-term buy. Nvidia’s upcoming product lines and revenue streams have positioned them positioned the company to be at the forefront of a growing deep learning and AI industry. Automation and self-learning software are becoming a larger part of our lives every day and Nvidia is creating the tools necessary to meet these new computational demands."

So right now, NVDA is at 86 and I feel like although I'm very proud of the amazing gain, I lost the chance to increase profits by  1.5x and perhaps more by EOD today. 

Now unfortunately I'm not experienced at all so I didn't look at anything like how big tech is improving today, I didn't look at trends or anything. 

What do you suggest I can do in the future to get a better return? Or is this too risky to worry about? "

# Description

At their core they are *just* another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves:

> NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing.

And what does that mean?

> a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve.

i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars.

In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions

* GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters
* Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry

You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc.  

And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division!

## Recent financials 

The last 5 years started off tough with sales only getting going in the last 3 years...

|Jan period end|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $5.0bn | $4.7bn | $4.1bn | $4.3bn | $4.0bn|
|EPS | $1.08 | $1.12 | $0.74 | $0.90 | $0.94|

But the ""breakout"" really came this year with the forecast, for year ending Jan 2017, of $6.8bn in sales and an adjusted EPS of $2.41. Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line.

Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off?

## Competition

Nvidia divides it's competition into 

> Our current competitors include:

> * suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;
> * suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and
> * licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.

So looking at margins and returns, they are clearly in the same zone as Intel, Qualcomm and Mobileye... though are far from best in class. Perhaps that indicates there's room for further margin expansion?

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
NVIDIA Corporation | $6,138M | 27% | 25%
Ambarella Inc | $283M | 18% | 13%
Apple Inc. | $215,639M | 33% | 37%
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. | $4,124M | -8% | -ve
Intel Corporation | $57,927M | 39% | 17%
Marvell Technology Group Ltd. | $2,458M | 4% | -1%
Mobileye NV | $301M | 35% | 18%
QUALCOMM, Inc. | $23,554M | 35% | 18%
STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) | $6,781M | 13% | 1%
Texas Instruments Incorporated | $13,145M | 44% | 32%

## Cash / Debt?

NVIDIA has $3,626M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 8% of the market value. Far from atypical in Tech to run cash positions, so nothing to worry about here.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $83.60 for NVIDIA Corporation and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies a downside of 5% to their target. Weird eh? A *Buy* but the target price is lower! 

Is this a case of Wall Street brokers being behind the curve? 3 months ago the consensus price target was $64 when the stock was at $63. *fail, Wall Street*!

# Valuation

The only business that's pricier is Mobileye. Surprise eh? 

And when I look at it's market value on $47bn versus Qualcomm on $99bn, it feels odd. Okay the growth is amazing, but what's so bad about Qualcomm (and Intel) for that matter. Even if they are ex-growth...

...oh the shame of being late to this story :(. 

# Dividends

NVIDIA Corporation is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.48 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.35 per share. That is a 37% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.48 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.41.

On top of dividends, the company's a fan of repurchasing stock. Just seems like they've not found any acquisition targets for their cash pile / cash machine. Either they are very disciplined, are the bees-knees at R&D and can build it all themselves... or management doesn't see a tangential business to expand into. Regardless, it's not a reason to complain. Keep the cash coming, boys!

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 40% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 32%. On a 1 year view the stocks up 200% v earnings forecasts up 130%. Clearly there's some ""valuation"" inflation coming thro'.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, the CEO / founder was asked to explain what was driving the growth. It's rather a lot of techno-babble but it's worth thinking thro'

> * First of all, GPU computing...we've essentially taken very compute-intensive, very graphics-intensive applications, virtualizing it and putting it into the datacenter.
> * the thing that really made it possible was really the transformation of our company from a graphics processor to a general purpose processor. And then, on top of that, probably the more important part of that, is transforming from a chip company to a platform company
> * And with GPU acceleration, the benefit is incredible. It's not 20%, it's not 50%, it's 20 times, 50 times.

So, Nvidia is making computing faster and more power efficient. It expands dramatically what you can do (gaming, autonomous cars, etc) and where you can do it (in smaller and smaller more mobile devices).

It's easy to see why this technology is important. But I feel like I missed the boat. The contrarian in me is worried by the number of requests for this stock and commentary on r/investing. 

# Napkin Math

But to go the extra mile, let's reach for the cafe napkin, trust in Wall Street's forecasts and look out into the distant future. Sure valuations of high fliers like NVDA come back to earth, but the growth is so strong, why'd you care.

|Companies|PE ratio|Growth|Divie|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
NVIDIA | 37x | 25% | 1%
Intel | 13x | 10% | 3%
Qualcomm | 14x | 11% | 3%

If NVDA going to see it's valuation return to a market rating in the long-term, then the 25% earnings from will turn into high-teens gains, as the PE compresses. In contrast, INTL and QCOM are trading below a market rating. But a re-rating aside, if they eek out low double digit growth in earnings and keep a high divie, their long-term gains is almost the same.

|Companies|Gain = |Change in Valuation + |Growth + |yield|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
NVIDIA | 18% = |-8% + | 25% + | 1%
Intel | 16% = | 3% + | 10% + | 3%
Qualcomm | 16% = | 2% + | 11% + | 3%

So, I can take the hot stock and hold it for 10 years or the old men and get to the same place. Assuming Wall Street's good at forecasting. An assumption that's proved unreliable in the past. ;)

Perhaps I should consider a tangential bet? e.g. [Citrix](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/ctxs.o) or [VMware](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/vmw) if the virtualization story is key. Any takers?

2016-12-23 00:08:40,SteamandDream,What to do with my NVDA stock?,"I'm new to investing and I had a good friend (and more experienced trader than I) tell me that he considers holding stock for anything less than a year to be gambling, so I bought a stock with the intention of listening to his advice. I bought NVDA at $60 in September and it closed today at $107, up 78%...When I bought it, I had planned to hold it for a year or so and then sell it. At that time though my thought process was ""I hope I'm not getting in too late because it has already grown a lot in the past year, but it's a good company in a good industry, so hopefully it'll be between $70 and $80 next year and I can save 10% of my gains by holding it for one year""...Obviously it has obliterated my expectations and now I'm conflicted as to whether or not I should stick to my original intention (hold for a year) or take the money and run. If I ran, it would be on Jan 2 (avoid counting it against 2016 taxes) or if the stock hit 100.00 or less next week...Am I doing this wrong?  Should I instead set goals of gains (5% and sell, 10% and sell, etc) without care for the length of holding? Should I instead be flexible (goals for holding period and gains) and play things by ear?  I read [this article](http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/12/22/2016/long-intc-or-nvda-heres-how-get-protection) today that says that ""short investors should stop loss at $93 and long investors should stop loss at $69"" but how short is ""short term"" and how long is ""long term"" in this article? I have no intention of holding it for 5 years.

I think it's funny that had I played the ""run"" card on Nov 11th I'd have missed out on $20/share of gain...up until today I had been firmly in the ""hold for a year or so"" camp which got me that extra $20/share, but this just seems too good to be true, like why would the stock price just keep soaring?  Soaring after an earnings report or huge deal announcement is one thing, but it seems to me that the company is soaring based on high expectations, which (as an amateur investor) says to me that if it only ""meets expectations"" (0.83 EPS) on it's earnings report that it's value will plummet. I feel like I might be behaving like a naive fool for clinging to this ""hold for a year"" mentality, but, then again, listening to it a month ago has resulted in me getting 33% more gains; devil on one shoulder, angel on the other, and no past experiences (or knowledge) to indicate whom is wiser. Any advice is welcome.


Background that may help with advice: at this point in my life (24 and single) I have no intention of building a long-term portfolio and instead intend to play with a little of my money to get a feel for how it all works before my money matters (i.e. family and whatnot). My reason for getting into stocks was to simply make sure my saved money keeps up with inflation (as opposed to rotting away in a savings account), therefore most of my money (my ""long term"" money) is in an S&P ETF where it is accomplishing this goal.

Thanks for the help!"

2017-01-10 12:41:00,Charuru,My thoughts on competition to NVDA in GPUs,"If you're interested in investing in NVDA check out my new subreddit /r/NVDA_Stock. It's shamelessly inspired by /r/AMD_Stock You can read and discuss this article here: https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/5n6ohq/nvidias_gpu_revenue_is_secure_for_the_next_year


**Nvidia's GPU revenue is secure for the next year, there is still no competition.**

There are many bears that are concerned about competition from AMD's Vega in both gaming and deep learning. I took the time to learn about Vega and study the state of the competition seriously. My conclusion is that competition is **non-existent**.



**Gaming**

Polaris failed to make an impact as we saw last quarter with NVIDIA's record revenues and AMD's very weak revenues. Coming a full year later after the launch of Pascal, Vega is expected to hit around GP104 performance. This level of performance is probably too low. GP104 was top tier in 2016 but will be merely mid-tier in 2017. The 1080ti will replace the 1080 as the gaming flagship for NVIDIA and Vega will only work as mid-tier competition. NVIDIA should also launch their Pascal refresh or Volta cards by fall of this year. If that's the case, then GP104 will fall to mid-low tier, not mid tier, and Vega will only compete on the budget level. As a result NVIDIA will once again face no competition in most of the market for gamers. 



**Deep learning**

In deep learning competition is again non-existent. Many people have pointed to Google also offering AMD cards in their cloud as a sign of validation for AMD as a deep learning competitor. But this is untrue and a media scam, or worse yet, some kind of scheme to fool investors.

https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/11/announcing-GPUs-for-Google-Cloud-Platform.html

Read the google cloud announcement directly instead of reading an ignorant regurgitation from financial news outlets.

> Google Cloud will offer AMD FirePro S9300 x2 that supports powerful, GPU-based remote workstations. We'll also offer NVIDIA® Tesla® P100 and K80 GPUs for deep learning, AI and HPC applications that require powerful computation and analysis. GPUs are offered in passthrough mode to provide bare metal performance. Up to 8 GPU dies can be attached per VM instance including custom machine types.

As we can see, only NVIDIA cards are being offered for deep learning. AMD cards are only used for remote workstations, an old and uninteresting usecase. AMD has no competition for deep learning as of yet. The FirePro cards are offered at extreme discounts to the NVIDIA equivalents, we're talking about prices that are only 1/2 to 1/4 as much. Yet Quadro and Tesla dominate the market vs FirePro. In any case, NVIDIA is not interested in engaging in a race to the bottom with AMD and the customer base for those products are generally not so price sensitive.

AMD also announced a Vega based ""Instinct"" deep learning platform. Though 5 years late, AMD is hoping to start the catch up with the launch of Vega. There are 2 questions to think about with Instinct in respect to whether or not it'll be successful in deep learning.

Question 1 is the hardware, is it competitive with P100? Question 2 is the software, can the CUDA moat of NVIDIA be breached?



**THE HARDWARE**

Reference article: http://www.anandtech.com/show/10905/amd-announces-radeon-instinct-deep-learning-2017

Hardware-wise, NVIDIA has a feature advantage. NVIDIA's cards are optimized for ""deep learning operations"" while AMD is not. But let's be clear here, ""deep learning operations"" is marketing for INT8. Most deep learning today is done on FP16. P100 is ""10x"" faster than Maxwell partly based on improvements to FP16 deep learning operations and is today far ahead of any competition.

In the future, AMD is advertising better support for FP16, bringing them up to parity with NVIDIA in that regard. But NVIDIA is moving ahead with support for INT8 operations, an even faster way of doing deep learning than FP16. INT8 is however useful only in some usecases.

> Deep learning research has found that trained deep neural networks can be applied to inference using reduced precision arithmetic, with minimal impact on accuracy. These instructions allow rapid computation on packed low-precision vectors. Tesla P4 is capable of a peak 21.8 INT8 TOP/s (Tera-Operations per second).

Investors should be careful to note that this is only NVIDIA marketing, INT8's usefulness in the real world has not yet been proven. In this case, hardware for INT8 did not exist prior to Pascal and it will be with the expansion of Pascal into the market that real applications for INT8 will be written. However if NVIDIA is correct (and I think they are), INT8 represents yet another generationally important hardware feature that NVIDIA has over AMD.

But let's ignore this for now and talk about competition in the more traditional FP16.

AMD is offering a Polaris, Fiji, and Vega based solution. 

Anandtech is politely saying that Polaris and Fiji are generally worse than the NVIDIA options.

> The MI6 and MI8 will be going up against NVIDIA’s P4 and P40 accelerators. AMD’s cards don’t directly line-up against the NVIDIA cards in power consumption or expected performance, so the competitive landscape is somewhat broad, but those are the cards AMD will need to dethrone in the inference landscape.

I'll be more realistic and say right away that simply means AMD is completely non competitive for the Polaris and Fiji products, especially considering the relative price inelasticity of deep learning customers and NVIDIA's lead in CUDA (which I'll get to in section 2).

More interesting is MI25, the upcoming Vega based product. It's got new architectural improvements of uncertain value. We simply don't know how it will compete against P100.

> As AMD’s sole training card, the MI25 will be going up against NVIDIA’s flagship accelerator, the Tesla P100. And as opposed to the inference cards, this has the potential to be a much closer fight. AMD has parity on packed instructions, with performance that on paper would exceed the P100. AMD has yet to fully unveil what Vega can do – we have no idea what “NCU” stands for or what AMD’s “high bandwidth cache and controller” are all about – but on the surface there’s the potential for the kind of knock-down fight at the top that makes for an interesting spectacle. And for AMD the stakes are huge; even if they can’t necessarily win, being able to price the MI25 even remotely close to the P100 would give them huge margins. More practically speaking, it means they could afford to significantly undercut NVIDIA in this space to capture market share while still making a tidy profit.

Anandtech is full of optimism for the MI25. I look at it much more critically. Even if the MI25 is competitive on the hardware level it is probably too late. Like in the gaming market, it comes a full year after Pascal and Volta-based deep learning chips are probably going to be announced before their release. This year's GTC (GPU Technology Conference), the annual NVIDIA hosted conference should see the announcement of Volta based V100 for deep learning. Pascal was announced at last year's GTC.

Based on this release cadence, AMD looks at least a year behind in technology even ignoring INT8. 


**The Software, CUDA Moat.**

A lot of investors have heard of CUDA and how important it is in deep learning. But it doesn't seem like its importance is sufficiently stressed seeing as how many bears are still out there talking about competition. CUDA has already won, there is no war, the war is over. NVIDIA's proprietary platform is as dominant as windows is over Linux. CUDA is easier to use, have a vastly bigger community, resources, tooling, love and support from everyone. There is basically no alternative. The idea of OpenCL winning vs CUDA in 2017 is as farcical as the idea of Linux winning over Windows on the desktop in 2017. So long as people love CUDA they will stick with NVIDIA.

AMD is going to attempt to breach the CUDA moat with the Boltzmann Project. It's a project to poorly port CUDA code to AMD compatible OpenCL code. To me this sounds almost a bit delusional... but I'll talk about it anyway. Has any software platform ever won by creating an emulator / port layer for another platform's user apps? Doesn't such a thing just send the signal that the winning platform has, in fact, won?

The Boltzmann Project is of dubious quality technology wise. I read in many places that the output is garbage. But just humoring it, we have to raise the question why anyone would want to port from a popular and great environment like CUDA to a crappy one like OpenCL in the first place. The only answer is, they don't want NVIDIA to get a monopoly on deep learning (it's too late NVDA already has a monopoly) and want to support AMD to help it become a competitor.

The only problem is such logic is that computer scientists are not fanboys. People generally don't spend weeks of work time to help out a company for the purpose of charity. They want to get stuff done, make software, get their AIs to make recommendations, help translate languages, create machine music, make medical diagnosis, whatever it is that they're doing. 

Is it possible for AMD to make ground in the CUDA moat? I can't dismiss it out of hand, if AMD makes an unrealistic, absurd amount of investment in that effort, I can see them making progress. [It's just extremely unlikely, and everyone knows it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4m417z/amd_polaris/d3sholx/
)

In conclusion, there are no concerns about competition vis-a-vis AMD. But that doesn't mean there isn't a bear case for the NVDA stock. Stick around /r/NVDA_Stock and check out some other posts.

2017-04-15 12:16:20,abaabe10,(My first) DD on $NVDA,"Please give me feedback on my DD, and the formatting. I will try to implement ""fixes"" on this post.   
    
&nbsp;
     
General Information:   
*P/E Ratio 38.05   
*Div Yield 0.59   
*Market Cap 56.30B   
*Institutional Ownership 75%   
     
&nbsp;
     
P/E Ratio:   
A few interesting things to consider here are:   
Q1 2015 P/E Ratio ~18   
Q1 2017 P/E Ratio ~ 42    
Also note the fact that in Q1 2015 the stock cost only $20.    
     
In my opinion NVDA is not overvalued at all. Every single segment is more than likely going to grow (more on that later). When you compare NVDA to other tech growth stocks a P/E of 38 doesn't seem so high anymore.    
For example: ANET 52, SKY 61, and then there are players like TSLA that don't even have income. NVDA is the top growth stock for a reason.
    
&nbsp;
    
Institutional Ownership:   
An interesting thing to keep an eye on is that on March 31, 2016 institutional ownership was at a high of 90.72%. Which shows that quite a bit of institutions jumped ship, but the shares were picked up by non-institutional owners. However, 75% is still a quite high ownership when compared to AMD, INTC and others. **I am a bit worried that the drop we are seeing right now is a result of more institutions jumping ship.**    

&nbsp;
    

Now getting to the actual interesting part:   
My DD on Q1 2018 earnings:   
    
&nbsp;
    
This is an important [slide](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-1XAJD4/4285688894x0x927425/01843210-E2B4-4E1F-938E-17F33C305078/Rev_by_Mkt_Qtrly_Trend_Q417.pdf) to estimate future growth:   
One thing to note is that the gaming segment is historically very weak in the first quarter.    
    
&nbsp;
    
Gaming:  
[Sources](http://investorplace.com/2017/04/analysts-nvidia-corporation-nvda-stock/2/#.WPJs-ojyuUk) are saying that this quarters gpu sales are down 15%, which is 10% more than in the past. This sounds bad, but one has to remember that 15% down from a record $1,348M income is still a load of money. That results in an income of $1,146M, which is still in line with NVDA's estimated revenue for this quarter. On the other side of things, the 1080TI sales are estimated to be quite high. Additionally, it seems that NVDA has picked up quite a bit of market [share](http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey) from its competitors.
   
&nbsp;
    
Professional Virtualization:   
I don't have too much to say about this segment, but I am sure that it will bring in over $200M in revenue.   
    
&nbsp;  
    
Data center:   
This segment seems to be exploding. NVDA's revenue trippled year over year, and it doesn't seem to slow down. If you look at the rest of the market, you will come to the same conclusion. I would be surprised if revenue was below $300M.   
    
&nbsp;
    
Auto:   
Tesla recently broke out, because they finally got their production up. Additionally, their pre-orders are not stopping. This translates 1:1 into NVDA's revenue. NVDA currently has over 50 automated driving partners. I wouldn't be surprised to see a beat up to $175M, but since I like to be conservative I will say $140M.   
     
&nbsp;
    
Lastly we have OEM & IP, which seems to be the least interesting segment. It has been declining for some time now. Maybe I am missing something here, but I don't think so. We are still going to see a solid $150M of revenue in this segment.     
     
&nbsp;
     
Now one last thing are the switch sales. The sales were [reported](https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/14/superdata-nintendo-sells-2-4-million-switch-consoles-worldwide-in-first-month/) to be 2.4 Million units in its first month. That *could* translate into more than $100M in Q1 revenue assuming Nintendo had kept their inventory at JIT levels.  
Edit on this: Actually NVDA's Q1 ends on May 1, which means it is quite likely that Switch will reach 3 Million by that point. We might see more than $150M in revenue from the Switch.    
   
&nbsp;
    
**Finally, if we add up all the segment we are well above the estimated $1.9B in revenue.** I think that even if we ""only"" reach the estimated 1.9B we will go back up from the current $95 per share to at least $105. A beat might create a second Q3 2016 (maybe not that big haha).   "

I strongly believe Crypto/Machine Learning to be a massively profitable sector in upcoming years, but would like to diversify in case GPUs get phased out.  As there are different routes to the same destination, and some are better than others. 

Does anyone know a way to make a play on ASIC manufactures on US exchanges?  I am struggling to find a single company as there seems to be such a broad range of ASIC.

2018-03-05 12:28:44,Noqt,"Long $NVDA, involvement in AI will bring success for them long term","$NVDA is a gaming company. It has been since its inception. Most recently, Nvidia has been big into Artificial intelligence. Most headlines reference something to do with AI. I think this transition from gaming to AI is important for Nvidia's growth in the next decade. My price target for them is a 40% upside, $329. Is that even possible given how much it's grown this past year? I think so. 


I'm just going to go over some catalysts and some risks:


Catalysts


* New GeForce series using the new Volta architecture, Series 20. Announcement will be big, should be in March 2018. The already released GPUs with Volta have been successful, I expect that trend to continue.


* Cryptocurrency becoming more popular. Crypto isn't going away, so I'd assume it to be a catalyst. I don't like to pay attention to it. 


* Two years until we are seeing some of Nvidia's big autonmous vehicles come to life. Both the driving platform they are developing in china with ZF and Baidu, and the Volkswagen VW AI-infused Bus are expected to be actualized in 2020. If we see some success in the execution of these projects, I'd consider it a catalyst. I'm confident their execution will be successful given the success they've already demonstrated in AI with their datacenter revenue.


* Gaming industry big news (PC). Every year there is more gamers, every year gamers get better jobs, every year there are more games. GPUs are an integral part to gaming, so these revenues will grow with the gaming market.


Risks:


* Semiconductor industry decline. The semiconductor industry is interesting because a decline in one can cause they others to underperform. This is an entire topic on its own.


* AMD/new GPU designer taking market share from Nvidia. Unlikely, but Nvidia's dominance in the GPU market is why I am so bullish. I want to invest in the leader of AI deep learning training hardware and graphics processing, not the second best.


* Jensen Huang, the CEO, losing his ability to lead the company. Nvidia has has successfully positioned themselves to be a part of the future of AI, which I think is accredited to Huang's execution. This is a positive, he's invested in the company. The downside to this is that he is very important and anything that hurts his ability to lead would hurt Nvidia.


* New GeForce 20 series being not much of an upgrade from series 10, possibility but I think unlikely. Unlikely because their Titan V uses 12nm technology.


Price Target:


* I used a DCF model to arrive at the price target of $329, using a 7% discount rate and 1% perpetual growth rate. In the model I assume 39% revenue growth in Nvidia's 2019 fiscal year, 32% in 2020, and 28% in 2021. I based this off their plans in autonomous driving, and their new GeForce series to be released with Volta architecture. 


What I think:


I think Nvidia successfully integrating its hardware into so many big company's is a huge success for their long term goals. Nvidia hardware is being utilized in Tesla's electic car's autopilot 2.0, and used by Google and Amazon Web Services datacenters. Nvidia is so dominant that no one can take these positions unless the company wants to build their own chips, which would be billions of dollars in R&D. Nvidia is supplying hardware for these big companies and there is no one to compete.


TLDR: NVIDIA is investing into AI. Nvidia's Drive PX 2 operates Tesla's autopilot 2.0 system, Nvidia's new Tesla GPUs have grown datacenter revenue by 133% this last year, and their focus on the narrow AI to bring autonomous vehicles on the road is proving to be worth it. $329, long equity. 


Why am I doing this?


Well I don't think I am perfect and I think I missed A LOT, so I want some critisism to get as close to perfection as I can. Read the paper and look at the model."

Cryptocurrency related sales were reported to be just under USD$300mm which made up roughly 9% of total revenue. OEM sales increased 115% and 148% Q/Q & Y/Y respectively. OEM sales for this quarter came in at 12% of total revenue vs historical averages under 10%. It is clear this quarter was an outlier, yet revenue is expected to be USD$3.1bn, a 39% increase Y/Y for 2Q2019, even with a 65% drop in cryptocurrency related sales. This would imply that other core businesses like its Datacenter & Automotive sector may continue accelerating. Additionally, Nvidia’s gaming and professional visualization, where it receives 60% of its revenues, growth will likely pick up to meet the company’s revenue target. Perhaps it makes sense to buy the weakness off the crypto related fears?

2018-09-19 09:47:00,Stealth2k,Initiate AAPL or increase NVDA X-post,"Lurker here and new investor in the big picture of things.

&#x200B;

Currently hold a position in NVDA with a cost basis of $198 with 2k in. Was considering initiating a position in AAPL with enough to purchase 10 shares. It would appear I won't go wrong either way for a long hold, but felt curious to know what sentiment is felt around here. Do I increase my position into NVDA by 2k, or throw that towards AAPL in a new position to further diversify.

&#x200B;

If any other details would be fair to share this is through my 401k brokeragelink through work ran by Fidelity. I have holdings in MSFT, V, CGC and FOCPX a tech mutual fund that has good performance over its lifetime.

&#x200B;

As I'm trying to diversify I'm having a tough time wanting to leave the tech space as I'm high on these companies like most people. These are holds I plan on having until retirement or longer as far as I'm concerned right now. Any other feedback or suggestions are welcomed!

This is by far the highest price target out of all analysts covering Nvidia, with most price targets currently around $300. I try not to pay too much attention to just price targets alone, but this seems just a bit bold.. Thoughts?"
2018-10-26 12:08:11,abeecrombie,"Understanding the SEMI cycle.MU, NVDA, AMD, TXN, $SOX","I though I would write a short post for some of the youngins here who have never experienced a real correction or know what a market cycle is. 

1) The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful

2) Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its  always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually  cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad. For months  there have been signs that the semi cycle is topping out. Suppliers like LAM and AMAT topped out a while ago as demand is slowing. And then you had KLAC at a conference a few weeks ago talking about order growth slowing and then TXN finally confirmed that we are in a semi slowdown. Why? Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler  data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS. They will keep spending but I would expect the market to be more prepared now.  

The good thing about the semi cycle nowadays is that there is a lot more demand than just PC's or smartphones. So eventually it will come back. And IMO we are probably half way through it already. Asian semi's and suppliers got the message a long time ago. Look to them for the first signs of a bottom. 

Happy trading

Currently trying to pick between these 2 and having done my own research wanted to throw it out to this sub to see what I’ve missed.

Coming at this pretty much purely from a cloud gaming view which will dominate gaming in the future.

AMD: Also in the CPU market and are making major in roads here, and will likely grow market share in years to come. Google and Microsoft (leaders in the future of cloud gaming) are both using AMD gpu’s to fuel their platforms. CEO seems to have done a brilliant job since joining and should continue to do so.

NVDA: Also in the AI/machine learning/full self driving space. Tesla make their own chips but if other car companies want to catch up, they go for the next best thing which is NVDA atm. NVDA has their own cloud gaming platform and it is the biggest atm but I think long term google and Microsoft will overtake them comfortably. Not sure what NVDA would then do in this space, especially since cloud gaming may dislodge their GPU sales in consumer devices.

Leaning towards AMD at the moment but would welcome any thoughts."

The market won‘t stop that covid-party anytime soon. So there will definitely be some harsh days coming up. 
They‘ve already gone down to 183 but I am wondering if they will fall back again. They for shure didn‘t even encounter supply chain issues jet so we might be in for a rough ride. Also their quarterly earnings might hurt, so there will be a few other selloffs. But I am wondering about the right time. Will it be after the next report?

2020-09-02 09:05:02,street-guru,$NVDA - Goldman raises target to $585 on Ampere Gaming launch,"""The generation to generation improvement in performance, coupled with flat generation to generation pricing trends, implies an increase in performance/$ that is larger on the Ampere generation of cards than the Turing generation. Recall that based on data provided at Nvidia's various Investor Days, 98% of Nvidia's installed base was on Pascal (introduced in 2016) or older generation cards entering 2019. Based on past trends, we believe that around \~3/4 of the installed base was on Pascal or older generation cards entering 2020. We believe this is important as a) it implies that 3/4 of Nvidia's installed base is on cards that are \~4 years old, b) our view is that the typical GPU refresh cycle is around 4 years, and c) ultimately, we believe the larger performance/$ increase relative to prior generations could accelerate the installed base refresh cycle. Importantly, we also believe that the improved generation to generation value proposition (as measured by performance/$) will contribute to positive mix shift within the Gaming segment, and in turn, segment-level gross margins.""

""**AMD read-through.** We believe that the timing of Nvidia's Ampere introduction is in-line with investor expectations heading into the event and that this is unlikely to change sentiment on the relative competitiveness between Nvidia and AMD's Gaming GPU business, especially given our view that AMD is scheduled to release RDNA 2 GPUs in the 4Q20. While AMD has improved execution across its client CPU and server CPU businesses over the past several years, the company has seen less success in its Gaming GPU franchise with share flat to down since 2016. As a result, we expect competitive dynamics between the two companies' businesses to remain largely unchanged, with our estimates implying ongoing share loss for AMD in the near term."""
2020-09-04 08:29:53,daynightcase,"NVDA bull case, need advice","I personally love this company despite the high multiple and stock being overvalued because of how innovating they are year after year and amazing leadership. There is still lot of growth in cloud and autonomous sector and they have no real competition in my opinion beside TESLA. Just watch their GTC keynote if you haven't. Its crazy how much they are keep innovating. Image processing is going to be central for AI, scientific research, autonomous and you have to use their data centers since no personal computer can have that much GPU power. 

Can someone in the field share more knowledge on how crucial GPU will be in coming years and how easy it is for competition to catch up?"

2020-09-14 07:06:34,street-guru,$NVDA - street's initial take on $40b ARM acquisition from Softbank,"This confirms months of speculation...here are the initial thoughts from analysts.

**Needham** \- ""Will It Be Game Changing? We Shall See.""

""We believe the acquisition represents a big risk but with potential huge awards. From a financial perspective, this acquisition is the largest deal in NVIDIA's history. We are not concerned about the size of the deal because NVIDIA generated $4.3BN of free cash flow in FY20 and is on track to generate $5.2BN in FY21, and hence we expect it to make up the $12BN in cash fairly quickly, even without a contribution from Arm. Additionally, the dilution represents only 7% of total shares - not a major event, in our view.""

""Strategically, we believe there are several advantages: in the near-term, Arm IP is ubiquitous in the mobile phone and tablet markets with 95% share. NVDA can harvest that steady cash flow stream to finance growth. ARM has a cumulative number of licenses signed of 1,767 as of F4Q19 and 22.8 billion royalty units as reported by licensee. Longer-term, Arm is gaining inroads in the all the major secular growth drivers in technology including cloud and infrastructure equipment, edge IoT, robotics and self-driving vehicles. Arm technology is being used in advanced MCUs for IoT devices such as communication chips and sensors and broad range of networking equipment.""

""On the skeptical side of the equation, we wonder about the anti-trust factors as Arm is the ""Arms-dealer"" in the semiconductor industry with a long list of customers, which include competitors, such as TI, MRVL, AMD, IFX, QCOM, AAPL, Samsung, NXPI, AVGO and others. We also need to have a better understanding of the long-term revenue ramp and overall TAM. Arm's net sales have been lackluster for the past two fiscal years, growing 3% in FY19 and declining in FY18 due to deterioration in overall business conditions in the semiconductor industry.""

**Jefferies** \- ""NVDA + ARM = $50 EPS Power in 2025""

"" We view the deal as transformative, positioning NVDA not just to capture 80% of the ecosystem value in the data center, but also unify the compute ecosystem between the edge and data center. We think the merged company has a 5-yr EPS power of $50, and increase our price target to $680, and bull-case to $1,000.""

""We estimate the deal to be slightly accretive the first year after close.""

""Transformative Deal - Heterogeneous Data Center Scale Solution Provider: In previous computing eras, one ecosystem typically controlled 80% of the profits of the ecosystem – in PCs it was Wintel, in Smartphones it is Apple. Due to the ecosystem it has created in Acceleration (processor, interconnect (MLNX), software stack including CUDA and vertical market software), we’ve argued that Nvidia was best positioned to capture 80% of the profits of the Parallel Processing Era. However, with ARM, we think Nvidia is poised to also offer general purpose, heterogeneous data center scale solutions and ultimately capture up to 80% of the value of the serial processing part of the data center ecosystem as well. We also think that ARM gives it a larger moat in the data center.""

""Transformative Deal - Unifying the Edge with the Data Center: the Cell Phone / Server Computing Era was the first where compute bifurcated, and two separate ecosystems operated in parallel (Apple’s ecosystem in the Smartphone, and Wintel in the data center). Should Nvidia successfully acquire ARM, then the compute ecosystem will be unified from edge to data center, and we would expect Nvidia to offer more highly integrated compute solutions across the entire compute ecosystem, and realize the lion’s share of the profits in this 4th Tectonic Shift in Computing.""

""Five-year EPS Power of $50. We believe this is a differentiated interpretation of NVidia's earnings potential which stems from our view that Nvidia is supplying an ecosystem in the data center, much like Apple supplies to the smart phone market, or Intel and Microsoft did in PCs. In contrast to other traditional semiconductor competitors, Nvidia's ecosystem extends beyond processors, to high speed interconnect (MLNX) and a software stack. During the PC Era, Microsoft's PC operating profit was similar to Intel's, and we think Nvidia's earnings potential framework should be modeled more like Wintel, with half of its earnings power coming from the ecosystem that it created. We model Nvidia Data Center processor revenues of $34bn in 2025, and Data Center Ecosystem (software) of an additional $34bn.""

**RBC -** ""We continue to believe the same three major points: 1) biggest hurdle in our view is approval/official closing of transaction; 2) if the transaction closes, we think this would be a notable negative for Intel and a notable positive for Nvidia; and 3) with Apple, Amazon, and now Nvidia, a robust software ecosystem is ready to support an ARM-based server environment over the long term.""

"" What do Apple and Nvidia have in common? Access to successful software ecosystems. Since x86 has been the dominant player in the server market, Nvidia could argue that the transaction would create more competition against the x86 market. Currently, the market is largely Intel \~85–90% (x86) and AMD 8–10% (x86) and a few points “Other” depending on how one defines the total market. If Nvidia puts research and development dollars behind the transaction, an ecosystem to compete against x86 would be possible, in our view, given Nvidia’s success with CUDA. Finally, AWS has a new Graviton product based on ARM architecture. It is arguably a stable/solid alternative given its lower power consumption. We’ve seen this story twice in the past in the Flops/Watt (GPU>CPU) and TCO (AMD>INTC""

**Raymond James** \- "" As we had suspected earlier, much of the justification for the deal in the presentation centers on the datacenter market. Based on our initial read of the presentation, we view this as an assault on Intel’s server CPU business. The intention would seem to be to become able to offer server customers a broader roadmap that covers both CPU, GPU and server. It’s yet unclear however about how a NVDA datacenter business that would offer server CPUs benefit from NVDA owning ARM as opposed to simply being a licensee. Nonetheless, we do view this as a move on NVDA’s part to compete more fully with both INTC and AMD in the server pace. MRVL is also an ARM licensee for server CPUs, but since MRVL has already announced that they would only pursue custom server CPU engagements going forward, we don’t expect much impact to MRVL. Undoubtedly, the combination of ARM’s leading processor IP with NVDA’s GPU and AI IP will create a powerful combination. But it’s not immediately clear how NVDA intends to leverage having ARM under their own ownership, and will expect that vision to be part of the company’s presentation.

""The presentation notes that NVDA intends to continue ARM’s open licensing model and NVDA IP would also be added to ARM’s licensing business. That could certainly become additive to the revenue for the total licensing business, but more details will need to be provided to understand the potential revenue synergies.""

""The transaction requires regulatory approval the U.K., China, the European Union and the United States. China approval will naturally be viewed as a risk given US/China trade tensions. Since ARM IP is the foundation of nearly all handsets and IOT devices, we would expect the deal to be highly scrutinized, and we would expect that NVDA would need to provide assurances that it will continue an open licensing model. NVDA is an ARM licensee, but ARM processors is a small part of NVDA’s business, limited to the automotive business (3% of revenue) and the Nintendo Switch custom processor (4% of revenue, by our estimates). Therefore, since there is a very small part of revenue in which NVDA competes with ARM licensees, we don’t expect that to raise significant regulatory concerns."""

Which causes an additional 10% gain on the NVDA stock price.","I’m not sure if any of this is legal, but Soft Bank seems to know how to squeeze every juice drop from the orange. They know how to make money on all angles of the deal. If this doesn’t make you long on Soft Bank, I don’t know what will. They are true hustlers."
2020-09-26 14:42:38,DogtorPepper,AMZN vs AAPL and AMD vs NVDA,"AMZN vs AAPL

And

AMD vs NVDA

To me all of these are solid stocks, but if you personally had to pick only one from each group which ones do you believe have higher growth potential over the next 5 to 10 years?

I already have a stake in all of these companies, but I’m looking to figure how to allocate new investing money other than a simple equal division

Thoughts?"
2020-10-24 22:53:39,Okmanl,"Aside from companies like Tesla, Square, Amazon and Microsoft what other companies do you think are currently the most innovative today?","Topic. I like Catherine Wood’s thesis of the market not being able to properly price in innovative companies. 

For example amazon coming up with AWS and 6Xing in value since then. Or Tesla announcing batteries with significantly higher life span. Or square announcing opening physical banks. What other companies do you think are just as innovative today? Why?"
2020-11-09 14:18:03,qwerty5151,Why did NVDA drop today?,"NVDA was down 37 points today, which I wasn't expecting

I couldn't find any nVidia news, and it looks like their earnings aren't until next week. Is this just a correction for the recent surge?

I'm hoping I made the right decision by buying at the end of the day, but it seemed like it still had some downward momentum."
2020-11-10 12:58:33,Bcarvea97,NVDA triple top?,"I’m looking to do a earnings play with nvidia. Their stock seems to be hitting 570-580 before diving off a cliff to low 500’s which pretty much happened today. At these prices it’s looking real juicy but looking at the chart it seems to have hit a triple top in my opinion which usually isn’t a good sign. My question is what are your expectations for the stock in the next week or so, and should I buy at these levels? Thanks"
2020-11-13 13:37:27,korbman,NVDA: Impact of Amazon moving away from nVidia chips to custom ASICs?,"In a [blog post for Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/majority-of-alexa-now-running-on-faster-more-cost-effective-amazon-ec2-inf1-instances/) yesterday, it seems Amazon has been developing their own ASICs (AWS Inferentia) to better power Alexa and their AI infrastructure, and the results seem pretty great - "" resulted in 25% lower end-to-end latency, and 30% lower cost compared to GPU-based instances for Alexa’s text-to-speech workloads.""

Since they're currently using NVIDIA GPUs to power this part of their business, what do you think the long term impact would be for NVIDIA? 

I suspect since Amazon's Alexa / AI side of the business will continue to grow, cutting NVIDIA out of the picture would be a significant blow to them, and a boon for Amazon. But maybe this could have also been one of the reasons NVIDIA sought to buy Arm a couple months ago?"
2020-12-08 18:36:48,NY10,NVDA vs AAPL,"
As title indicates, which one is better long term investment? The growth rates for both are 18% vs 11% respectively for 12 months period. AAPL pays slightly more dividends than NVDA but not whole lot considering both pay less than 1% yield. I like NVDA more but the current price is a bit too high. Anyway, let me know what’s your thought on these two tickers."
2021-01-14 13:33:12,Okmanl,Anyone here buy and hold the most hyped stocks on Reddit from 3-5 years ago? How has that turned out?,"So far I'm going with Jeff Bezos' investing philosophy he outlined in one of his interviews. To just pick a bunch of high risk, high reward long term opportunities, and invest in all of them. If any one or multiple of them pan out, then it'll easily make up for the losers.

So far I've decided to just completely ignored index funds. Instead I'm just DCAing into whatever I find has huge long term potential based off of what reddit, youtube, motley fool or ARK has hyped up. 80% of my portfolio is in BTC, ETH, TSLA, SQ, LMND, DKNG, uranium stocks, and ARK ETFs.  I'm planning on adding solar and marijuana ETFs.

I've also decided not to sell a single stock no matter what happens, until I have enough to just put everything on VT/VTI and live off of that.

Has anyone else pursued this strategy for the past 4-5 years? If so how did it pan out? When I look at old posts from 2-3 years ago it seems that AMD, MSFT and NVDA were the ones that were hyped up. But I can't really tell because I'm only looking at what was most upvoted and using search terms like ""what are your top picks for the long term""."
2021-01-19 04:19:07,alles_long,AMD: Undervalued at $90,"AMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th. As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $90. I’ve made a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kwfxp7/amd_still_undervalued_at_95/) about this but there was some news last week which I incorporated in here is well.

&#x200B;

**Intel struggles**

Last week Intel has announced that they will replace Bob Swan with Pat Gelsinger as their CEO. This has led to Intel stock going up 13% and AMD dropping 5-6%. Intel is trading above(!) above the stock price they were when they announced the delays in 7nm/5nm. I think this reaction is severely overdone. Note that Pat used to be CTO at Intel for many years and is not the fresh blood they need to turn this colossal company around. Also in the time he was CEO of VMware (since 2012) the stock only rose 60% which is not a great performance comparing it to competitors. Intel has already announced their Q4 ER will beat estimates but that was a given. The only thing that is relevant is their outlook, which is still going to be meager since a CEO impact the company over years time (see AMD themselves) . AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could see something similar if Intel gives a weak guidance for the coming year(s)

&#x200B;

**AMD Q4 and FY**

EPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.

&#x200B;

**2021&2022 Outlook**

But the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC’s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU’s that can go head to head with NVDA’s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger goes trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned tailwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply P/E’s off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML’s for example (50). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.

&#x200B;

**Booming Market**

Finally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion.

2021-01-21 01:57:07,titus65,Expected effect on NVDA of ARM acquisition approval?,"I believe we might have a sleeper here in NVIDIA. The stock has moved sideways for a while since the ARM acquisition is on standby pending antitrust reviews in several countries and the outlook is rather negative on the subject because of complications with ARM China.

This vaguely reminds me of Tesla initially being denied inclusion in the S&P 500, the stock went flat and down for a few months and the market was ""surprised"" when S&P eventually included them, which they could have done at any time.

Also I think they are poised to capture a good chunk of self driving with a system similar to Tesla based on vision (no lidar) and machine learning (not geofenced), which doesn't seem priced in.

So yeah, this is just a hunch, not serious DD obviously but do you think NVDA is due for a good pop once the ARM buyout closes?

2021-02-09 05:23:19,Kme2,Second Quarter Results: 6 months into the /r/investing underrated stock survey and the average return was 72% (37% as a portfolio),"Building on a previous post ([http://redd.it/i2thge/](http://redd.it/i2thge/)) asking the community to pick underrated stocks, there was interest in seeing the quarterly performance of everyone's picks

The first quarter can be seen here: [http://redd.it/jti14m/](http://redd.it/jti14m/)

For this quarter, the key takeaways are as follows:

* Overall average return of 72.2% (driven by the GME pick)
* If you invested equally in each stock, returns would have been 41.9%, or if you bought one of each stock, returns would have been 37.5%
* 86% of the 254 picks have shown a positive return, with 80% greater than 10% return and 20% greater than 100% return
* Highest returning pick: Gamestock (GME) at 1342% flagged by  /u/EmployerOfTheMonth, to which they stated *""If it goes up, people will think I'm some sort genius for going against the crowd, if it goes down, people will just mindly brush me off as a moron for actually thinking this was underrated""*
* If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks (NET, CRSP, STNE, NVDA, NOK), you would have seen an average return of 62%
* If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks (TSLA, WD, AMD, LMND, UBER), you would have seen a return of 93%
* If you had invested equally in the stocks with greater than 10% return in the first 30 days, your total return would be 53.1%

In graphical format, you can also see the results here: [https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png](https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png)

For those also interested, there was a stock picking survey back in October of 2018.  That overall portfolio is up 58% with an average return of 138% (driven by the triple digit gains in Enpahse and Tesla).  You can see the original picks in my history; happy to provide an update on that one if there is interest."
2021-02-22 08:57:58,norcalnatv,NVDA ER and ARK Invest point to more upside for NVIDIA,"Nvidia  reports earnings for FY21 Wednesday the 24th.  Analysts are expecting  revenue of $4.8B and EPS of $2.80.   My expectation is closer to  $5.1-$5.2B and EPS and $3+ for the Quarter.  Nvidia has topped revenue  estimates 10 of the last 12 quarters and beat profit estimates in 11 of  the last 12.   Demand remains high and the company has indicated their  gaming segment is already sold out through Q1.

The  blog below has an interesting take on the overlap of these two  companies.    It describes how NVIDIA’s technology covers every single  point in ARK Invest’s 2021 “Big Ideas” presentation.   I really doubt  there is another “disruptively innovating” company making such an impact  against their ""big ideas.""   Certainly ARK’s #1 holding TSLA, isn’t  anywhere near significant to their future as NVDA, let alone the others  rounding out their top 5: Square, Teledoc, Roku or Baidu.

The  mysterious part is NVDA is one of ARK’s smaller holdings.   All NVDA  shares in the three ARK funds they’re held in make up only 0.5% of all  assets in ARK’s actively managed funds.   Counter intuitive.

ARK  has started buying NVDA more prominently in late Dec.   With positive  earnings and a big fund acquiring looks like there could be plenty of  upside in NVDA.

2021-03-24 00:48:19,SnooObjections2665,Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolution,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)
* Semi-conductors
* Biotechnology / Healthcare
* IoT manufacturing
* Renewable energy
* Manufacturing / Mining
* Crypto (I have no experience in this besides some small positions in BTC and ETH, feel free to drop any DD and knowledge)

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.
   * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce
      * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data.
      * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity.
      * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But Amazon and Microsoft are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.
   * **Amazon - $AMZN**
   * **Microsoft - $MSFT**
   * **Cloudflare - $NET - See DD in previous category**
   * **Fastly - $FSLY - Need DD**
   * **Digital Ocean - $DOCN - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Ai**
   * **Google - $GOOGL - Need DD**
   * **C3Ai - $AI - Need DD**
   * **Nvidia - NVDA - Need DD**
   * **Intel - INTC - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Advanced Robotics / automation**
   * **Teradyne - $TER**
      * Focusses on industrial automation, semiconductor testing, wireless testing and storage testing. Customers are Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. **Some of their business units are:**
      * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives
      * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics.
      * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts
      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.
      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries.
   * **Cyberdyne - $CYBQY - Need DD**
   * **ABB - $ABB - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.
   * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.
   * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

This resource provides the essential metallic and magnetic raw materials used in most modern technology from Electric Vehicles to windmills and robotic arms. Yeah. That’s HUGE. There is obviously a massive need for these resources going forward and MP is the only chance the US has of competing with China in this demand. Of course, China operates in a market condition where they can exploit working conditions and the workforce in ways that American companies cannot, and MP claims to engage in their mining activity sustainably. Noting that MP (Mountian Pass) Mine is in California, we can assume they are doing their best to remain in compliance with a green energy future. MP NET INCOME Q4 2019: 1M MP NET INCOME Q4 2020: 24M

“NVIDIA today announced its first data center CPU, an Arm-based processor that will deliver 10x the performance of today’s fastest servers on the most complex AI and high performance computing workloads.

The result of more than 10,000 engineering years of work, the NVIDIA Grace™ CPU is designed to address the computing requirements for the world’s most advanced applications — including natural language processing, recommender systems and AI supercomputing — that analyze enormous datasets requiring both ultra-fast compute performance and massive memory. It combines energy-efficient Arm CPU cores with an innovative low-power memory subsystem to deliver high performance with great efficiency.

“Leading-edge AI and data science are pushing today’s computer architecture beyond its limits – processing unthinkable amounts of data,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Using licensed Arm IP, NVIDIA has designed Grace as a CPU specifically for giant-scale AI and HPC. Coupled with the GPU and DPU, Grace gives us the third foundational technology for computing, and the ability to re-architect the data center to advance AI. NVIDIA is now a three-chip company.”

Everything Apple has been doing lately has me thinking it's likely to fall soon due to their upcoming security changes. I'm have a relatively small position 10 shares at 127.96. So I won't be making a huge profit but I do think Apple might be a buy in the future when its cheap again. I like Apple products but their security update is seriously having many people globally hesitant to the stance the brand is taking. Is it time to take profits? Thoughts?

edit: Based on all the comments I decided to hold and will buy more during the next dip as I have no real need for the cash. For those mentioning taxes here in Canada my AAPL stocks are in a TFSA (Tax free savings account) which means gains and withdrawal are non taxable.

2021-08-23 07:08:42,Cygopat,As I'm writing this NVDA has overtaken TSM as the world's most valuable semiconductor company,"NVDA market cap:  $535,91B

TSM market cap:  $517,93B

ASML market cap: $333,46B

INTC market cap: $213,92B

I fully realize that the term ""semiconductor"" is no more perfectly accurate for NVDA as it has been expanding heavily on the software side, yet that software is based on them selling chips so I still think its the correct category of industries for NVDA and a very interesting observation of what the market thinks the future of these companies holds."
2021-08-25 15:41:55,r2002,Department of Energy will buy an Nvidia-AMD powered supercomputer because Intel is months late on delivery,"[Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-near-deal-nvidia-supercomputer-190754396.html?.tsrc=rss):

>The U.S. Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from Intel Corp that has been delayed for months, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

>The Nvidia and AMD machine, to be called Polaris, will not be a replacement for the Intel-based Aurora machine slated for the Argonne National Lab near Chicago, which was poised to be the nation's fastest computer when announced in 2019.

>Instead, Polaris, which will come online this year, will be a test machine for Argonne to start readying its software for the Intel machine, the people familiar with the matter said.

A more technical breakdown can be found from the [DOE's lab's website](https://www.anl.gov/article/us-department-of-energys-argonne-national-laboratory-and-hewlett-packard-enterprise-prepare-for).

To be clear, the Intel deal is merely delayed, but not canceled. How does this change the narrative of Nvda/AMD versus Intel in the high-end server and super computer space? Are these kind of delays very common? I.E It's not a big deal.

Or did Intel just messed up a very visible and prestigious deal that will accelerate nvda/amd's surge to capture Intel market share?

*edited to add* [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-amd-polaris-supercomputer-department-of-energy) also interpreted the DOE's purchase of the Nvidia-AMD machine as being caused by Intel's delay."

2021-12-04 07:43:00,ESComments,Why is valuation for semiconductors so poor?,"Even after the surge this year, most of them are still trading at valuations far below other tech companies. Historically, it's a cyclical business right. However that is based on decades' worth of trends which have less relevance in today's economy. Semiconductors these days can turn profits rain or shine and the worst they encounter is a slowdown in growth. Not a surprise given the explosion of connected cars and IOT. Meanwhile software companies lose money for years at nosebleed valuations and no one bats an eye. Where is the logic. And why does an Nvidia get such a high premium over a Micron (GPUs yes, but the gulf in valuation is too extreme).

Edit: Thank you for the detailed responses all. There is a lot I don't agree with still on valuation but the technical color has been very interesting to read."

Imagine you have a punchcard and it has 20 spots.  These 20 spots represent the only 20 companies that you are allowed to buy for your entire lifetime.

I think about the punchcard a lot and love the concept, as it makes me think deeply about whether or not I would use 1 of my 20 “punches” on a given company that I am analyzing.

On this topic, what is the #1 company that you would feel confident “punching” on your card and holding for the rest of your life?

2022-04-08 19:39:42,iminfornow,ASML: CEO and CTO will depart within 2 years while NVDA seeks to double authorized shares,"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery. Recruitement is looking outside the organisation for board members.

I found this after reading that Nvidia seeks approval to double authorized shares to 8 billion. The longer I think about this the weirder it feels. They just did a split and they currently have 2.5B shares outstanding, so there should be more than enough room to do basically whatever, everything but a split.

I also thought the announcement they'd be interested in working together with Intel IDM was pretty weird; on the day Intels CEO spoke to congress. Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification. Nvidia recently announced they'd be adopting the standard as well, while at the same time announcing they'll open up NVLink-C2C to other suppliers.

Is it just a coincidence all these events are happening at the same time?

2023-05-17 21:52:24,eichenes,Infamous letter from Sun Microsystems CEO to shareholders after DotCom burst,"Sun peaked at a $200bn market cap in 2000, then crashed and was finally sold for $7bn to Oracle a decade later. Their Price to Revenue ratio at the peak was only 10!

They had actual decent revolutionary products too: 
From Java programming language to SPARC processors, StarOffice, MySQL, Solaris OS, VirtualBox & ZFS!
They were involved in all important areas of tech.

This is what the CEO wrote to bagholders:

“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?” 

Little he knew... NVDA with Price to Revenue of 28 & 53% earnings shrunk YoY is considered cheap!"
2023-05-18 21:08:15,ST530,Is there potential to short NVDA?,"I was taking a look at the general semiconductor industry and was surprised by the metrics of NVDA. The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. 

I also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.

I do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.

Seems that going short through ITM or ATM long dated puts seems legitimate. What do you guys think?"
2023-05-24 19:13:21,cookingboy,Nvidia shares spike 26% on huge forecast beat driven by A.I. chip demand,"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2024.html

Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings for its fiscal 2024 on Wednesday, with a stronger-than-expected forecast that drove shares up 26% in extended trading.

Here's how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates for the quarter ended in April:

EPS: $1.09, adjusted, versus 92 cents expected
Revenue: $7.19 billion, versus $6.52 billion expected
Nvidia said it expected sales of about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the current quarter, more than 50% higher than Wall Street estimates of $7.15 billion.

Prior to the after-hours move, Nvidia stock was up 109% so far in 2023, mostly driven by optimism stemming from the company's leading position in the market for artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was seeing ""surging demand"" for its data center products.

Nvidia's data center group reported $4.28 billion in sales, versus expectations of $3.9 billion, a 14% annual increase. Nvidia said that performance was driven by demand for its GPU chips from cloud vendors as well as large consumer internet companies, which use Nvidia chips to train and deploy generative AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Nvidia's strong performance in data center shows that AI chips are becoming increasingly important for cloud providers and other companies that run large numbers of servers.

However, Nvidia's gaming division, which includes the company's graphics cards for PC sales, reported a 38% drop in revenue to $2.24 billion in sales versus expectations of $1.98 billion. Nvidia blamed the decline on a slower macroeconomic environment as well as the ramp up of the company's latest GPUs for gaming.

Nvidia's automotive division, including chips and software to develop self-driving cars, grew 114% year over year, but remains small at under $300 million in sales for the quarter.

Net income for the quarter was $2.04 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $1.62 billion, or 64 cents, during the year-earlier period. Nvidia's overall sales fell 13% from $8.29 billion a year ago.

*Personal take*: I don’t even know what to say, this is simply astonishing. The AFH price puts NVDA at 20% above its previous ATH. This jump would have been insane even for 2021, let alone the tech market of 2023.

AI will be the main focus and the main buzzword for the entire tech industry for the next few years, and I expect many companies to pivot toward that one way or another (even if it’s just paying PR lip service) in order to catch the wind in the sail."

2023-06-03 17:14:39,gameforge,At what point will index fund investing stop working?,"The money in an index fund is used to purchase shares of all the equities in the index. The underlying intrinsic value and performance of those equities will never be considered by the shareholders.

As many are quick to point out, most big cap stocks are currently heavily overpriced. For example, [Pepsi](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP?p=PEP) currently costs $38.67 per $1 of profit today. Who would pay that price for a company that only [grows](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP/analysis?p=PEP) ~8% per year at best? Its top three [shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP/holders?p=PEP) are Vanguard, State Street and Black Rock.

How much of the blame for overpricing goes to passive investors who shovel money into everything regardless of its value or performance? I'm perfectly guilty of this myself of course.

Passive investors dream of cashing out on that compounded 9.1%/year growth of the S&P 500 over time, and we can all backtest and see that past performance. But we can't really backtest the ever-increasing observer effect that index investing must have over time.

To get to the point, at what point does the S&P 500 simply track the performance of index funds and render the stock market a meaningless Ponzi scheme? Or have I simply gone bonkers to think about this, and if so, what am I missing?

Charlie Munger has often [pointed out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tojx4J2HYD4) that index investing doesn't work if everyone does it. Are any economists studying the notion that index investing itself is poisoning the market averages that seem harder and harder for stock pickers to beat every decade?"

2024-01-11 01:39:35,cookingboy,Nvidia reminds me of Cisco during dotcom.,"**Note**: This post is *descriptive* of my personal observations and is for discussion purposes only. It is neither *predictive* in what will happen next nor is it *prescriptive* in suggesting any course of investment actions. 

I've only done [3 predictive posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/s/pAtSiWhCXo) on this sub and this won't be one of them.

For those who are too young to remember that time:  There was this new thing called ""the Internet"", and it was going to forever change the world (it eventually did), and every company that hypes up some sort of ""internet tech"" (could be simple landing page that sells stuff, i.e Pets.com) received sky high valuation. 

And there was one company behind it that made it all possible: Cisco, the company that sells industrial routers and switches to telecom providers that power the backbone of the entire internet infrastructure, was *obviously* a company that was ""selling shovels during a gold rush"" and would take over the whole world. 

Its share price went up 236% from Jan.1999 to March 2000, reached a valuation of $500B+ (record high for a company back then), P/E went through the roof but it didn't matter because the *Internet Revolution^TM* was *just beginning* (and it was), so naturally Cisco's share price could only go higher.

The cherry on the top was that back then the **top two** companies were *Microsoft* and *Cisco*, one would provide the software (**Internet Explorer baby!**) and the other would sell the hardware. Together they would rule the world!

Now if you replace ""Internet"" with ""AI"", and ""Cisco"" with ""Nvidia"", keep Microsoft as it is (but replace ""IE"" with ChatGPT""), and we have quite a mirror version of what's happening today.

Then we all know what happened. Cisco obviously survived the bubble burst and remains profitable and is still doing fine today, but $CSCO *never* recovered back to its dotcom bubble peak after crashing 80% during the dotcom bust, 23 years later.

Now will the same thing happen with $NVDA? Like I said I don't know and I'm not making any predictions. All I can say is that I see a lot of parallels *so far*.

**Edit**: For people replying to me arguing how you can't mine Bitcoins using network switches or how Cisco didn't do AI, *no kidding*, at no point did I claim the two companies are identical and sell the same things, that would be idiotic.

All I am saying is the *hype*, *expectation*, and *position* of these two companies in their respective backdrop, are *similar* to each other."

I'm in a bit of a conundrum with my NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) investment and could really use some advice.

Currently, I own 50 shares of NVDA valued at around $30,000, purchased back in 2017 at $34 per share, with a cost basis of $1,700. This stock has seen unbelievable growth since then of over 1600% and now constitutes 45% of my non-taxable investment account and roughly 20% of all my investment accounts, excluding my home.

Last year, I sold about $5000 worth of NVDA to diversify, but I'm torn about what to do next. On one hand, the stock has been on a tear, and their future looks extremely promising with AI advancements and the huge demand for chips going forward. However, I'm aware of the need to diversify, as well as the risk of the stock taking a massive downturn and significantly hurting my net worth. There are also tax considerations if I sell, since I'll be on the hook for some significant capital gains tax. 

For some context, I'm a married man with two kids, a house with $200k in equity and a $200k mortgage. I have around $80k in IRA accounts and $65k in taxable brokerage accounts amd some cash on hand for emergency fund etc. Little debt otherwise. 

Any advice on whether to sell and diversify, ways to mitigate risks, or hedging strategies would be greatly appreciated. How should I navigate this situation, considering the potential tax bill, its outsized share of my portfolio and the promising future for NVDA? Thanks in advance for your insights!"

2024-02-08 21:38:56,anjo__13,…Is everyone really maxing out all their retirement accounts before allocating to their taxable brokerage?,"Hello everyone,
Imma be honest, i dont know a lot about investing/finance so idek if the question makes sense to most.

But basically, i see it encouraged everywhere to always max out tax advantaged accounts (if applicable) first before contributing to a taxable brokerage, is everyone really doing that?

I get that the salaries of ppl here are probably way bigger than mine, but i ask this question because I see individual stocks like aapl, nvda, tsla, etc. and i think ‘oh it would be interesting/fun to invest in stuff like that’ but ..i know I should like max out my 401k first yknow. So like …wow everyone really has leftover money to just fck around huh ?"
2024-02-09 13:36:01,fhltnt,What stock have you lost the most money on (realized or unrealized or both),I’ll go first. For me it’s Tesla. I always seem to buy right before a 30% drop and sell right before it goes on a run. I’m not as confident in TSLA long term as say NVDA or MSFT. This leads me to jump in and out more than I normally would. TSLA has never been a huge percentage of my portfolio so the loses haven’t been crazy but that’s definitely my biggest turd.

I'm not comfortable with options but want to take insurance ahead of earnings.

2024-02-12 20:29:12,Lkaynlee,Should I invest the money I'm saving for a down payment until I'm ready to buy?,"A little more context: My wife and I are saving up for a down payment for a house, and we're hoping to buy sometime in the next 2.5 - 4 years. And until we're ready to buy we also want our money to be making money for us over while we wait. 

Our first thoughts were to keep our future down payment savings in one or two HYSAs earning about 4.5% APY since they're at a 15-year high. However, I know once the fed funds rate starts coming down, probably in the second half of this year, so will the rates for HYSAs. Another option we've considered is putting our down payment savings into CDs which will lock in a better rate (\~5.4%) for a year even if the fed funds rate goes down. 

I've also considered putting some of our savings into a brokerage account and using it to invest in the S&P 500 (likely FXAIX) and letting it grow over the next 2+ years. This could have greater returns. But of course we then run the risk of losing some of that money if the market drops. 

Any thoughts and opinions are welcome."
2024-02-13 18:26:55,fhltnt,Is NVDA really over valued long term?,"Title says it. If you’re looking to hold for 10-40 years is NVDA really overvalued? Let’s take Apple for example. On September 28, 2018, AAPL hit an all time high of $56.44. It was followed by a steep fall to high $30s in late 2018. Almost a 30% decline. I’m sure it hurt investors at the time. And I’m sure a lot of people were kicking themselves saying “I shouldn’t have bought at all time highs when it’s so overvalued.” However, if they held for about 5 years until today they’re probably thrilled to have bought for $56.44. I’d personally load the boat with AAPL these days. Sure their return isn’t as high as it could have been but timing the market is all but impossible. My point is, if you’re bullish on a company for strong reasons. The risk of overvaluation/draw down should not keep you sitting on the side lines. Time in the market beats timing the market. If you’re not bullish on NVDA please explain why?"
2024-02-13 20:04:36,anonoman010101,I think the owner of the company I work for is stuck in a ponzi scheme. How to proceed?,"Anonymous one time post. I handle the financials for a guy and his multiple companies. The owner of the company I work for has an investment broker, he's been around for a handful of few years. Almost every month (more in recent months than previously) the broker tells him he can get him a 30% return, the minimum he can buy in for every month is a million - which he takes in towards the end of every month. The owner has invested many millions and gets an interest check at the beginning of every month. I talk with both the owner and the broker fairly regularly. I was told that an extra million invested increases the monthly interest by about $23k - so annually that's about 28%. The broker has made comments such as, ""I have up to $10M available for this investment this month"". I don't know what it's actually invested in - although he does get a statement, I just haven't looked close enough at what it's invested in (although if it truly is a ponzi scheme, the statement very well could be fake). The owner has mentioned this to many other professionals he works with and many of them have reached out to me about how it's very fishy. I met the investment broker once, as did one of these other professionals, and we both had the same reaction - the broker is very arrogant, super questionable, and just comes off as a complete scum bag.

The broker is listed on the website for a major investment bank. He's listed on Advisor Check and Broker Check and has what looks like a clean record - over a dozen years experience with multiple firms, multiple exams passed, licensed in 30+ states. 

Am I thinking wrong here? I just can't believe the return, it's completely unrealistic. It's also odd that the minimum is $1m and the guy is trying to sell more investments at the end of every month, then paying out interest at the beginning of every month - seems a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul. I've thought about making an anonymous tip to the SEC, but I feel like I'm risking a lot by doing so. I don't even know how to approach this. In my mind there's no chance this is legit, but at the same time, the interest checks have been coming in without issue. And what about the Broker Check stuff and doing everything under a major investment bank? I don't know enough about those things."

2024-02-20 14:12:32,MitraMan-Backup,Im dumping my 2050 Fidelity TDF for FXAIX S&P500,"Man I’m kinda pissed.   I have a TDF for  2050 (26 years away) so I haven’t checked on it in a while.   It’s supposed to be “aggressive” at this stage and since the S&P 500 is up 25% in the last year, that’s what I expected to see when I just looked.  Nope, 11% growth.   Turns out this fund is in the bottom 22% percentile of its morning star category.  

I don’t understand why TDF’s are being so risk averse when the date is 26 years away.  I know US stocks have not ALWAYS outperformed international stocks but aren’t we paying a fee for them to keep their finger on the pulse and adjust accordingly?   They couldn’t maybe read the room and see we’re in a major bull market and maybe put a little more into US stocks?

I’m going all in on S&P 500 and *maybe* in 10 years all start to diversify to make it more conservative.   

I know TDF’s are popular here but I just don’t understand how it could underperform so badly.   This one year (13% in lost gains) probably set my retirement back 3-4 years. 

Edit:  just so you all don’t think I’m ONLY looking at the last 1 year:

My TDF annual return over the last 10 years is 8.5%

S&P is 12%

So that’s a difference of 3.5% annually over 10 years which realllly adds up.   Basically my retirement portfolio would be 40% higher than it is now.

2nd Edit:  since this TDF’s inception in 2007, its annual return has been 6%.   S&P 500 over this time is 9%.  So 1.5x the returns.   This time period obviously includes the 2008 recession and S&P 500 is still waaay better.  "

> Revenue came in at $22.1 billion, up from $6.05 billion a year before, while analysts had been modeling $20.4 billion.

> Data-center revenue at Nvidia NVDA rocketed more than 400% from a year before to hit $18.4 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for $17.06 billion.

> Nvidia forecasts continued strong growth for the ongoing quarter, well above expectations. The company is calling for $24.0 billion in revenue, up from $7.2 billion a year prior, while analysts were modeling $22.2 billion.

> Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,” Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a release. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.”

> Nvidia posted fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $12.3 billion, or $4.93 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $5.16 a share, while analysts were projecting $4.59 a share.

I own Nvidia, so I admit, I am biased. But I think anyway you slice those numbers, they’re pretty damn impressive. If it’s a bubble, it’s a bubble that people are buying into. And by people, I mean, giant, multinational companies. It’s amazing growth for a company so large. 

I’m hoping this brings some calm back to the markets. We’ve been pivoting between irrational exuberance and panic.

**EDIT**: it is the next day, and the results are in. My personal account earned 27.9% TODAY. That is from 2 NVDA options and 1 SMCI option. My larger retirement account made 11.2% today based on NVDA stock SMCI stock NVDA option and lots of ETFs. Probably no one will see this edit. But as a normal investor, the reason I’m in this space is because of these returns. The reason a lot of people are here are because of these returns. And you can choose to ignore them if they are outside your risk and comfort level. That makes perfect sense. But there are compelling reasons to be here as well."

I lived through .com era and it was vastly different. If you said you were an online mall, you could get $1 billion the next day. Because people understood malls and this Internet thing was going to raise all roofs. 

Pets.com? I know what a pet is..com makes it even better!

I remember the exact street I was driving on when the one trillionth radio advertisement for Amazon came on the radio. And I was like, what a stupid name for a bookstore. Amazon has nothing to do with books. And for years and years and years, Amazon, lost money. They only existed because that.com Bubble had lifted them so far they had Cash. Lotsa cash. But they were a joke for about a decade.

But the real big thing was almost none of those companies had a profit. They didn’t make any money whatsoever. None. No business. They were burning through cash with expensive offices, expensive staff, oh man, salaries for tech workers were astronomical.

The companies that did have a profit, we’re making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didn’t meet this criteria.

Cisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150.

If it’s a bubble, it’s nowhere near the size of the.com bubble. S&P 500 is P/E of 22. In 2000 it was 28.

> Nvidia’s margins stand out among those elsewhere in the chip sector. Intel Corp. INTC, reported a gross profit margin of 46% while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, reported a 40% margin in the fourth quarter

> Nvidia did note that its margins for the latest quarter and the current one could represent a peak due to favorable component costs in the supply chain in the past few months. But Nvidia had “visibility” into a mid-70% gross margin for the balance of this fiscal year, which would take margins back to where they were before this latest high-water mark.

I know most of them sell some annually just for cash and whatnot but it does not seem like the norm that is happening right now. I can not find out if or what they are buying into. I also saw Soros and Buffet sold all of their bank stocks completely. I think that might be due to the gov. ending funding on March 11th for the banks but I am not sure.

Some of this info may be outdated but the articles I read were between Oct. 23- Feb. 18th 24. So if I am misunderstanding something please let me know.

TLDR: If the billionaires sold so much then what are they buying?

Edit: Some of you seem confused about the post. As you can see I mention some people that are not known for their stock portfolios. I was not asking this question so I could go spend my small amount on whatever they are ""investing"" into. I was looking for interesting things that I did not see or understand. For example, the Zuckergburg farm and all the conspiracy around it have been hilarious and very enjoyable reads. Also learning about some of the technical ways Buffet moves money that I did not know about has also been interesting.

Basically, I am just asking so I can learn and have something enjoyable to read on subjects I don't fully understand. I am clearly not some financial guru.

2024-04-14 09:52:25,SwellsInMoisture,"10 years ago, we discussed how we select stocks. Here's the 2024 version.","Hi /r/investing, roughly 10 years ago there was a great discussion about [how we select our stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ecl4v/how_do_you_search_and_find_good_stocks/).  I discussed my method - Trending Value - and that led to me sharing my results with many of you via a program I had written.  Well, that program broke and remained dormant for years... until now.

So what is Trending Value?  It's a method published by James O'Shaughnessey in his ""What Works on Wall Street"" book. During decades of backtesting, it generated over 21% annual returns with equal standard deviation to the total market.  It generated a lot of discussion and lead to [this follow-up thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1eyx3r/how_do_you_select_stocks_contd_trending_value_see/). In my mind, this method resonates the truest... far truer than those who advocate watching the check-out lines at your grocery store to see which products are being purchased. The method, summarizing is the following:

When you run a screen for stocks with good P/E or P/B, what do you look for? You find a stock with a P/E multiple of 12. Is this good? Is this bad? Neither and both, without a frame of reference. O'Shaughnessey's method rates 6 key financial metrics for every stock against the whole market to come up with a cumulative VALUE BASED score. Those metrics are: P/E, P/B, P/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, and Shareholder Yield, which is dividend yield + stock buyback yield (i.e. equity returned to the shareholder in some way).

All 6 metrics are ranked 0-100, where 100 is the ""best"" ratio in the stock universe, and 0 is the worst. The top 10% of stocks will typically have scores in the 420+ range. They are undervalued relative to the rest of the market.

However, just because a stock is undervalued DOES NOT mean that it's a good buy. It could be facing legal action, failing drug trials, having a CEO that just went to jail, or other event that can't be reflected in these numbers. That's where momentum comes into play.

We take the top decile of stocks and reorder them by 6-month price momentum. Invest equally in the top 25, hold for a year, liquidate, repeat. The companies you buy are undervalued and the market is rallying behind them. Back testing, while not a prediction of future results, yielded a 21.2% average ROI with this method.

Of course, there's no screener that does this, nor is there a way to even view ""Shareholder Yield"" in one location.

When I started this 10 years back, [I used MatLab to solve this problem](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46816-oshaughnessey_v5-m).  Yes, MatLab.  Wrong tool for the job.  Thankfully, ChatGPT has turned even amateur hobbyist coders into useful contributors, and a python version has been born.

I'll post the results of today's run below.  Feel free to ask for a specific stock and I'll post the results of that ticker.  Keep in mind, it is filtered to Market Cap > $200M and the name of the method is Trending VALUE - your growth stocks (NVDA, TSLA, etc) are going to be viewed very poorly.

Edit: You'll occasionally see a value like ""10000"" for P/E or another field.  That means the value was either missing or negative.  This is to artificially just kill that field for that ticker."
2024-04-16 07:26:20,reignmade1,Is it Time to Bail on Apple?,"Was wondering what the sub thinks about holding AAPL at this point. I've had it since November, 2017 and it's up about 270% from when I bought it. At it's highest my gain was about 300%. It's down ~11% this year.

It just seems a bit saturated. iPhone is getting shellacked in China. They've got a great ecosystem of products and loyal customer base with one of the strongest brands in the world, but it feels like growth is limited.

Just wanted to see what everyone thinks. I know it's never a bad thing to sell and claim profits, but I know I'd kick myself if it did well later on. 

Also not sure where is a better place to park that money. I was thinking Netflix, it's been gangbusters recently, but the streaming market seems very iffy. I've got GOOG, NVDA, AMD, MA, V, MSFT, and META and not sure if I want to increase my exposure to any of those as well as they've done.

Can anybody elaborate on what Chamath meant by this? 

Why is Nvidia bad at inference? 

Is this about the idea that most of the value accrual will be on the AI application layer as opposed to the AI infrastructure layer? 

But then again - why does he believe NVidia won't succeed with its application layer (e.g., robotics platform, ...)?

2024-05-03 07:20:24,MapleByzantine,Do valuations even matter anymore for US stocks?,"More money is now in passive funds than active funds. Passive money doesn't care about valuations, it just blindly flows into the stock market based on existing company market caps.

Every two weeks, billions of dollars in retirement contributions flows into passive index funds. There's an ever greater supply of money flowing into passive instruments year by year and it doesn't care one bit about, say, NVDA being overvalued, it's going to buy NVDA based on it's current market cap relative to the rest of the market.

Moreover, the stock market is essentially a federally protected asset. Most Americans are relying on their portfolios to fund their retirement and so there's a case to be made that the federal government would always step in to avert a catastrophic crash. We could see future 50% crashes but at that point the government would step in and support the market somehow.

In such an environment, are metrics like CAPE ratios and P/E ratios still useful?"
2024-05-10 20:41:38,fireduckieman41,"If you had $500k-1M, what would you do to turn it into multi-millions? Medium to high risk answers only","Of course, there is no get rich quick scheme or else everyone would do it. But there is calculated high risks that could be taken to try and get multiples on your money in a relatively short amount of time (1-5 years). With $500k-$1M you could make pretty risky investments with potential huge returns. Assume your only goal is to become rich - as in you are not happy transitioning into a safer investment approach until you are at $5-10M (10x). Also assume you have a good job that is flexible enough to allow you to focus on your new endeavor and you have comfortable housing and basic needs covered where you don’t have to worry about ending up behind Wendy’s if you lost it all. It would suck losing all the investment money, but you are taking the risk in hopes to turn it in to life changing money. 

A few investment thoughts I had: 
- angel investment in start ups. You’d have to pick a winner which is hard of course, but definitely a way to 2-10x your initial investment if you get lucky. 
- invest in large real estate development. These aren’t usually just accessible to anyone, but if you happen to come across a development deal where it’s buying raw land to develop into a suburban neighborhood or building multi family/commercial, this would also be a way to 2x-10x your money depending on the deal. These funds work similarly to angel investments. There is either some syndication group that makes a fund to raise capital to buy land to develop into something and your investment gets you equity in the deal and this group would have a clear exit plan for how to return investors money. I think these deals are safer than angel investing, but harder to come across. 
- full time focus on trading. Stock market, crypto, whatever. With the stock market in particular you could have a (I know options is very high risk) a safer lower risk, longer expiration option trading strategy on large blue chip companies with very expensive contracts trading at a level that the average person just simply can’t trade on. For example, a $900 NVDA 3/25 call trading for a whopping $18k per contract. 
- buy a small online or physical business with the plan of investing significant capital in expanding the business heavily through marketing and acquiring assets to make it grow

Little background on me:
My wife and I bought a house every year since we were married. We had 3 by the time the Covid boom happened, all of them doubled in value. Sold one, bought 2 more that needed work and rehabbed them heavily and turned them into airbnbs - still early covid boom. We are relatively young (31 and 30), but lately we have been thinking, if it’s worth selling some property and trying alternative riskier investment strategies. Realistically, our homes are not doubling again in the next 5 years. We already received the “life changing” money benefit from making relatively smart real estate investments. The initial plan wasn’t to make a killing this quickly, but since we did maybe we should take some off the table and try our hand at something else. I get it, houses are a good long term buy and hold, especially since we have them at low interest rates. Yes, I also know we could do cash outs, but interest rates are higher now. We are young and could take ourselves to the next level with the proper risk and we are willing to consider it. Anyways, what kind of riskier investments would y’all look into?

EDIT and TLDR: if you had $500k-$1M what medium to high risk investment would you do? 

EDIT: I do not have that money, but I could if I sold some of my houses and I am curious what others would do if they had that money in cash. I know what the smart safe investments are already, that is not my interest. I am interested in serious discourse about calculated medium to high risk investments that I haven’t mentioned in my post.

[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) briefly passed [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) in market cap on Wednesday during intraday trading as the chipmaker emerges as the primary beneficiary of the [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. If it holds until the close, it will be the second most valuable U.S. company.

Nvidia hit a [$3 trillion market cap](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-briefly-passes-3-trillion-market-cap-on-back-of-ai-boom.html) milestone during intraday trading. Nvidia had a market value of $3.007 trillion at one point, versus Apple’s, which stood at $3.005 trillion.

Nvidia shares have risen over 24% since the company [reported first-quarter earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2025-.html) in May and have been on a tear since last year. The company has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, on which big tech companies spend billions.

Investors are also becoming more comfortable that Nvidia’s huge growth in sales to a handful of cloud companies can persist. For the most recent quarter, its data center business, which includes its GPU sales, rose 427% in a year to $22.6 billion in sales, about 86% of the company’s overall revenue.

Meanwhile, Apple shares are only about 5% this year, as Apple’s sales growth has stalled in recent months. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Apple said overall sales dropped 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% from the year-ago period. Apple faces strategic questions and issues about demand in China, manufacturing, and mixed reactions to its new virtual reality headset, Vision Pro.

Apple was the first company to reach $1 trillion and $2 trillion market caps. It has frequently been the most valuable U.S. company over the past few years but was again [passed by Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-01-11/) earlier this year. Microsoft has benefitted from the same investor demand for AI as Nvidia.

Nvidia’s stock has been more volatile than Apple. Founded in 1991, it was primarily a gaming company, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently it has sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services.

Nvidia shares have gone parabolic as its AI business has developed, rising over 3,290% in the past five years. It announced a [10-1 stock split in May](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-announces-10-for-1-stock-split.html)."

2024-06-17 13:06:24,LateApostate,"NVDA will see a near term pullback, even though it doesn't deserve it ","NVDA will pullback in the near term, even though it's a great company that has consistently delivered for its shareholders. Why must it come down? Well, I'm a firm believer that narratives drive market sentiment, way more than fundamentals or valuations. Narratives, especially when repeated, permeate. And for the past 5 days, the narrative builders have been relentless in giving a negative short term assessment of NVDA stock. By narrative builders, I mean the financial industry people on TV asked to comment.

I will give you an example. On Friday, Jim Cramer alluded to NVDA being overbought and how Larry Williams' model was predicting a pull back of the stock until end of July.

This morning, Fairlead's Katie Stockton was also on Squawk Box, saying that even though she firmly believes in the bull market, NASDAQ 100 will see some pain as soon as people see that NVDA is a bit overstretched.

Just 30 minutes ago, Jeff Kilburg of KKM Financial called that it's time to trim, take profits given that the stock added 1 trillion dollars in valuation.

There are countless others from different sources. I really believe that once you start to hear so many ""experts"" and street people talk like this, it is reasonable to expect that a stock will come down. Not because they are right in their assessment but because others listen to it and start to wonder about trimming their positions in a self-fulfilling prophecy. This happens even if only in the very short term, before correcting to the upside and pushing higher to new highs.

I actually think we are seeing the very pullback already: today, on a day when the Nasdaq is rising by 1.2%, Nvidia has found resistance around 0.3% increase and seems to be headed lower. Recently, NVDA has been the one pushing Nasdaq to new highs, so just this inversion is noteworthy.

I am not a bear. At least not in that sense. And I do hope NVDA pulls back 10-20% because I intend to buy more. Cheers.

2024-06-17 18:13:47,AfraidScheme433,NVDA after stock split won’t be like TSLA,"
Whether NVDA is overvalued or not is up for debate, I have been hearing on Youtube that NVDA will drop after stock split just like TSLA did.  Let’s look into some figures for comparison:

regarding NVDA, the current market capitalization as of June 2024 is around $3T. This valuation makes NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world by market cap, even higher than the peak valuation of over $1 trillion for TSLA.

In October 2021, TSLA PE ratio was quite high, reflecting its growth expectations and market enthusiasm. The PE ratio was around 250.96 at the end of September 20211, and it likely remained in a similar range throughout October. The forward PE ratio, which is based on projected earnings, was also elevated, indicative of the optimism about the company's future performance.

As for NVIDIA, as of today, the current PE ratio is approximately 77.182. The forward PE ratio, which considers expected future earnings, is around 46.823 (TSLA at its peak:67.57). These values suggest that investors are expecting strong growth from NVIDIA as well."

2024-06-18 18:01:44,phaskellhall,Selling NVDA with $1m gains,"I’ve decided I’m going to sell a portion of my Nvidia stock once I hit $1million profit. As of close today, I need an additional 22% increase to hit this threshold so it will likely happen before the end of the month or by the end of summer if things slow down/correct.    

A little back story, I bought my first shares in Feb  2017 for $2.77 and again in October for $4.86.  I’ve continued to buy big chunks of it over the last 7 years because I thought GPUs would be needed for self driving cars.  Little did I know the Ai boom and to a smaller extent crypto would help Nvidia catapult to now the largest company in the world.  

My total cost basis is $34k and I’m sitting right around $850k.  Gains are around 2600% which is insane.  

I still have more conviction that Ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so I’m a bit torn on actually selling any of it.  If I sold all the other years people told me Nvidia had mooned, well I wouldn’t be sitting on the gains I have today.  My gut is telling me to only sell 1/3 of my holding but I have no idea where else to rotate this into.  I’m also in a unique tax situation where all my gains on this trade are locked into 0% which makes it tempting to let it ride for another year or two for a true FATfire setup.  As with any compounding interest, once the snowball gets to this point, smaller 2-5% moves really move the needle (in both directions).  

Anyways, just want to share this with someone since I can’t really mention this to most of my friends without it affecting our relationship.  It’s anyone’s real guess what will happen with Nvidia in the future so I can’t imagine anyone can persuade me one way or another on this trade.  I’ve experienced similar gains on Tesla but failed to sell at the top and now only have a portion of my gains on that stock so I know when a bubble feels like a bubble and this is definitely in that territory now.

2024-06-29 15:23:03,Apprehensive_Two1528,Using nvda shares to Pay off mortgages. good or bad ideas? ,"My mortgage is an ARM that resets the rate to 7.885% in september.

I have roughly the same worth amount of nvda shares plus a few other stocks and index funds. The nvda shares alone can pay off the mortgage balance

If you were me, would you pay off your 7.89mortgages using proceeds from nvda shares?

If not selling nvda, would you pay it off with cash. i also have about same amount of cash at sideline.

I do have 12 month emergency funds in t bills, so not in a big urgent need for that cash

06 29 Edit:

Thanks every one who replied. This post gave me great insights.

Based on every remarkable reply in this post, here is the adjusted decision.. ( i was proning to completely pay off using sideline cash).

Here is the adjusted decision

I will pay 1/2 to 2/3 outstanding mortgage balance with cash on hands.

I will leave the rest 1/2 to 1/3 to reset to the higher 7.885% rate.

Reason being: 1) Last 30 year s&p average return is 10% ish a year. I have a good opportunity for the 2% opportunity gain in next a few years which I belive we are still in a cyclical bull market and has more than 50% chance to gain double digit next years.

2) the 7.885% reset would stay 12month only. i believe FED will cut rate soon, so the 7.885% would reset to a 7% apr in 2025 September and even further down in 2026. Then the opportunity gain for Not payinb off will be greater in 2025.

3) My NVDA shares would have tax implications and it’s really not worth selling at this level.

4) I need a small mortgage to prevent real estate fraud. A mortgaged house usually won’t get scammed since banks have crazy checks on documents..

I won’t pay off that loan until 2050… lol"
2024-06-30 15:50:31,XShadowSlayerX3,Dad has made 2% annual yield from his financial advisor. What advice do I give him? ,"Edit: Please see my newest post!!! I’ve updated with figures and portfolio. 

Hello all,

My dad, 3 years ago, gave a financial advisor who he hired through his bank about $300k of capital to invest with. 

Since then the total yield has been about 6% on that money, about a 2% annual yield. Which my dad’s friends have told him is ridiculously low. 

I asked to take a look at my dad’s portfolio and a lot of the company’s are no names and the portfolio is many pages long, I can add pictures of the portfolio in the comments if that’s any help.

This is not to mention that the 401k he has given said financial advisor about $800,000 in over the course of 10 years, which has him at about a total of 1.2 million right now. I would imagine is also a very low yield. His friend has told him that the total PROFIT he should have made off of that amount should have been 1.8/1.9 mil. 

He has absolutely 0 knowledge on anything investing, but has decided to have a talk with his financial advisor on what he’s paying him for exactly. What should he tell his financial advisor? Fire him? I hate that he might be getting taken advantage of, and I would much appreciate if anyone had any advice on what he should do with his money at this time. My father is 57, I am 19.

2024-08-30 20:12:11,dukerustfield,Nvidia’s massive stock buyback,"From MarketWatch. 

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-stock-buyback-plan-is-one-of-the-biggest-of-2024-is-that-a-good-thing-9beba5c5?mod=djem_mwnafterbell

> The semiconductor company announced alongside its earnings on Wednesday that it has boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion. That’s double the size of the $25 billion share-repurchase program announced a year ago

> Looking beyond the year, Nvidia’s announcement is tied for the 12th-largest [stock buyback] on record. The company is one of only seven in the U.S. to have announced a buyback program of $50 billion or more. The buyback authorization is 1.7% the size of Nvidia’s market capitalization, which is about $2.91 trillion.

I tend to like stock buybacks. I like them more than dividends. The company has enough faith in itself that it wants to secure more of its own profits.  If you’re spiraling down in the dumpster, there’s really no need to buy back— especially if you believe this is the High Point and it’s only going down from here.

Nvidia has a number of problems. One is that it has a gigantic amount of cash. It was estimated that within three years it might be able to turn out 270 billion in free cash flow

But as the big player in the market, both its own specific market and the broader market, it’s gonna have a real tough time making big deals. Meaning deals significant enough to affect the bottom line.

It’s in the old-school Microsoft phase where everything it does is gonna be examined for antitrust. Can you imagine if they tried to buy AMD or something like that? It’s never gonna happen even if it made sense and didn’t destroy competition. 

So they’ve got infinite money and kind of very finite things to do with it. their purchases of other companies has been around 300 *million* this year. Which is entirely insignificant.

However, I worry that the stock is insanely expensive. It’s noted that this gives them the option to pull the trigger whenever they want. So if there is a downturn, that’s good news for them because they’ll be able to spend triple digit billions buying themselves back.

So in one sense, you can look at this as potentially bad news. Meaning they expect enough volatility, including down swings, to make it possible and profitable to have the 12th largest buyback in history.  

OR they feel they aren’t gonna drop and this is just a low point of a forever-climbing stock price.

Either way it’s good for Nvidia, but it makes it tough for investors to predict. If this was anyone else, I think it would be a little bit easier, but there’s so much money and the scale is so vast that it’s hard to wrap my head around. 

If they had been able to buy the dip a month or so ago, it’s astounding how much money they would’ve made. Not to mention securing more of their future profits.

Obviously, companies of this size don’t move that fast and they aren’t playing a shell game. So it’s merely just a thought experiment to see how much money they would’ve created out of a blip.

Lots of companies do buybacks, and lots of high-tech companies do buybacks. And the timing of it can generally illuminate a lot of things. But in this instance, I’m having a tough time seeing through it. 

In the past, they haven’t been a really savvy financial company. They’re not doing all kinds of tricks and schemes and mergers and things to burn short sellers and whatever. They’ve just been “boring” R&D and managed to get ahead of at least three or four massive shifts in technology in the world economy. 

The stock split. I had kind of considered it surprising. It just didn’t fit who they’ve been up to this point. Why does it matter if they’re 3000 or 100? I suppose it’s nice that more of the unwashed can get in on the purchase. But it seems to be a small distinction. Like how many people could afford a few hundred bucks but not a few thousand bucks? AND are buy and hold stock investors. I said at the time it wasn’t gonna move the needle whatsoever. But beyond that, I just don’t really see the point.

As I’ve said, there’s a lot of reasons to do a stock buyback. But this magnitude and at this price have left me guessing.

I like to think it’s optimism of their future. And that two years from now the stock is going to be much higher. In which case it made perfect sense to buy now.

That’s my hope anyways.

TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales. If TSMC reports strong earnings, it could indicate robust demand for semiconductors, which is crucial since NVIDIA relies heavily on TSMC for manufacturing its GPUs. Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA.

Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may *revise* their ratings or ***price targets*** for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a **spike** in NVDA’s stock price.

Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors. Reports indicate that TSMC is now able to ship more chips than ever before.

Obviouly, NVDA is the largest in the AI space, but I see it as more of a stable growth play due to its already dominant position in the AI market.
