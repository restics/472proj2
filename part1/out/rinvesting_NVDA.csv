2024-01-06 04:46:49,apooroldinvestor,Is it a mistake to go mostly cash now? Don't feel like much upside from here.,"I'm really getting close to going about 70% cash. Presently sitting at about 30%.

All my positions are mostly long and I pay 0% on my long capital gains.

Also, I have 10 years worth of contributions in my roth that I can sell with no tax.

I seriously don't feel like much upside from here 

Yeah, maybe I could make a few thousand before another major pullback in February and March, but what's the point?

I realize a lot don't sell due to taxes, but like I said, I don't have that worry so why should I hold and see my gains evaporate and then have no more significant cash to buy if we get some serious sales in February or March like I think we will?



I've been watching Mad Money and Cramer has been saying ""you should take some gains cause the big money won't start buying mag 7 till they sell off more""

I think that's true.

I.made really good gains in nvda. I bought in at $144 a year and a half ago and I'm up to $490 a share, but it's been topping at $495 or so and then staying in range.

I've also been heavy msft aapl googl asml and lrcx and have very significant gains.

Don't see any reason that any stocks are going to go higher in the next few months till at least April if that.

Sure, maybe oil and utilities and industrials will go slightly higher but I think big money is waiting for the mag 7s to fall.

Anyone else going heavy cash right now?

Yes I'm an investor, but you have to be smart and to me sitting in the market at a top is not really smart, especially if you can sell with no tax consequences. 

Good luck all. We're in this together"
2024-01-11 01:39:35,cookingboy,Nvidia reminds me of Cisco during dotcom.,"**Note**: This post is *descriptive* of my personal observations and is for discussion purposes only. It is neither *predictive* in what will happen next nor is it *prescriptive* in suggesting any course of investment actions. 

I've only done [3 predictive posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/s/pAtSiWhCXo) on this sub and this won't be one of them.

For those who are too young to remember that time:  There was this new thing called ""the Internet"", and it was going to forever change the world (it eventually did), and every company that hypes up some sort of ""internet tech"" (could be simple landing page that sells stuff, i.e Pets.com) received sky high valuation. 

And there was one company behind it that made it all possible: Cisco, the company that sells industrial routers and switches to telecom providers that power the backbone of the entire internet infrastructure, was *obviously* a company that was ""selling shovels during a gold rush"" and would take over the whole world. 

Its share price went up 236% from Jan.1999 to March 2000, reached a valuation of $500B+ (record high for a company back then), P/E went through the roof but it didn't matter because the *Internet Revolution^TM* was *just beginning* (and it was), so naturally Cisco's share price could only go higher.

The cherry on the top was that back then the **top two** companies were *Microsoft* and *Cisco*, one would provide the software (**Internet Explorer baby!**) and the other would sell the hardware. Together they would rule the world!

Now if you replace ""Internet"" with ""AI"", and ""Cisco"" with ""Nvidia"", keep Microsoft as it is (but replace ""IE"" with ChatGPT""), and we have quite a mirror version of what's happening today.

Then we all know what happened. Cisco obviously survived the bubble burst and remains profitable and is still doing fine today, but $CSCO *never* recovered back to its dotcom bubble peak after crashing 80% during the dotcom bust, 23 years later.

Now will the same thing happen with $NVDA? Like I said I don't know and I'm not making any predictions. All I can say is that I see a lot of parallels *so far*.

**Edit**: For people replying to me arguing how you can't mine Bitcoins using network switches or how Cisco didn't do AI, *no kidding*, at no point did I claim the two companies are identical and sell the same things, that would be idiotic.

All I am saying is the *hype*, *expectation*, and *position* of these two companies in their respective backdrop, are *similar* to each other."

2024-01-25 23:40:27,RandomDude4548,"Seeking Advice on NVDA Investment Dilemma - Diversify, hedge or ride the wave?","


I'm in a bit of a conundrum with my NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) investment and could really use some advice.

Currently, I own 50 shares of NVDA valued at around $30,000, purchased back in 2017 at $34 per share, with a cost basis of $1,700. This stock has seen unbelievable growth since then of over 1600% and now constitutes 45% of my non-taxable investment account and roughly 20% of all my investment accounts, excluding my home.

Last year, I sold about $5000 worth of NVDA to diversify, but I'm torn about what to do next. On one hand, the stock has been on a tear, and their future looks extremely promising with AI advancements and the huge demand for chips going forward. However, I'm aware of the need to diversify, as well as the risk of the stock taking a massive downturn and significantly hurting my net worth. There are also tax considerations if I sell, since I'll be on the hook for some significant capital gains tax. 

For some context, I'm a married man with two kids, a house with $200k in equity and a $200k mortgage. I have around $80k in IRA accounts and $65k in taxable brokerage accounts amd some cash on hand for emergency fund etc. Little debt otherwise. 

Any advice on whether to sell and diversify, ways to mitigate risks, or hedging strategies would be greatly appreciated. How should I navigate this situation, considering the potential tax bill, its outsized share of my portfolio and the promising future for NVDA? Thanks in advance for your insights!"

But basically, i see it encouraged everywhere to always max out tax advantaged accounts (if applicable) first before contributing to a taxable brokerage, is everyone really doing that?

I get that the salaries of ppl here are probably way bigger than mine, but i ask this question because I see individual stocks like aapl, nvda, tsla, etc. and i think ‚Äòoh it would be interesting/fun to invest in stuff like that‚Äô but ..i know I should like max out my 401k first yknow.

And until we're ready to buy we also want our money to be making money for us over while we wait. 

Our first thoughts were to keep our future down payment savings in one or two HYSAs earning about 4.5% APY since they're at a 15-year high. However, I know once the fed funds rate starts coming down, probably in the second half of this year, so will the rates for HYSAs. Another option we've considered is putting our down payment savings into CDs which will lock in a better rate (\~5.4%) for a year even if the fed funds rate goes down. 

I've also considered putting some of our savings into a brokerage account and using it to invest in the S&P 500 (likely FXAIX) and letting it grow over the next 2+ years. This could have greater returns. But of course we then run the risk of losing some of that money if the market drops. 

Any thoughts and opinions are welcome."
2024-02-13 18:26:55,fhltnt,Is NVDA really over valued long term?,"Title says it. If you‚Äôre looking to hold for 10-40 years is NVDA really overvalued? Let‚Äôs take Apple for example. On September 28, 2018, AAPL hit an all time high of $56.44. It was followed by a steep fall to high $30s in late 2018. Almost a 30% decline. I‚Äôm sure it hurt investors at the time. And I‚Äôm sure a lot of people were kicking themselves saying ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have bought at all time highs when it‚Äôs so overvalued.‚Äù However, if they held for about 5 years until today they‚Äôre probably thrilled to have bought for $56.44. I‚Äôd personally load the boat with AAPL these days. Sure their return isn‚Äôt as high as it could have been but timing the market is all but impossible. My point is, if you‚Äôre bullish on a company for strong reasons. The risk of overvaluation/draw down should not keep you sitting on the side lines. Time in the market beats timing the market. If you‚Äôre not bullish on NVDA please explain why?"
2024-02-13 20:04:36,anonoman010101,I think the owner of the company I work for is stuck in a ponzi scheme. How to proceed?,"Anonymous one time post. I handle the financials for a guy and his multiple companies. The owner of the company I work for has an investment broker, he's been around for a handful of few years. Almost every month (more in recent months than previously) the broker tells him he can get him a 30% return, the minimum he can buy in for every month is a million - which he takes in towards the end of every month. The owner has invested many millions and gets an interest check at the beginning of every month. I talk with both the owner and the broker fairly regularly. I was told that an extra million invested increases the monthly interest by about $23k - so annually that's about 28%. The broker has made comments such as, ""I have up to $10M available for this investment this month"". I don't know what it's actually invested in - although he does get a statement, I just haven't looked close enough at what it's invested in (although if it truly is a ponzi scheme, the statement very well could be fake). The owner has mentioned this to many other professionals he works with and many of them have reached out to me about how it's very fishy. I met the investment broker once, as did one of these other professionals, and we both had the same reaction - the broker is very arrogant, super questionable, and just comes off as a complete scum bag.

The broker is listed on the website for a major investment bank. He's listed on Advisor Check and Broker Check and has what looks like a clean record - over a dozen years experience with multiple firms, multiple exams passed, licensed in 30+ states. 

Am I thinking wrong here? I just can't believe the return, it's completely unrealistic. It's also odd that the minimum is $1m and the guy is trying to sell more investments at the end of every month, then paying out interest at the beginning of every month - seems a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul. I've thought about making an anonymous tip to the SEC, but I feel like I'm risking a lot by doing so. I don't even know how to approach this. In my mind there's no chance this is legit, but at the same time, the interest checks have been coming in without issue. And what about the Broker Check stuff and doing everything under a major investment bank? I don't know enough about those things."

2024-02-20 14:12:32,MitraMan-Backup,Im dumping my 2050 Fidelity TDF for FXAIX S&P500,"Man I‚Äôm kinda pissed.   I have a TDF for  2050 (26 years away) so I haven‚Äôt checked on it in a while.   It‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù at this stage and since the S&P 500 is up 25% in the last year, that‚Äôs what I expected to see when I just looked.  Nope, 11% growth.   Turns out this fund is in the bottom 22% percentile of its morning star category.  

I don‚Äôt understand why TDF‚Äôs are being so risk averse when the date is 26 years away.  I know US stocks have not ALWAYS outperformed international stocks but aren‚Äôt we paying a fee for them to keep their finger on the pulse and adjust accordingly?   They couldn‚Äôt maybe read the room and see we‚Äôre in a major bull market and maybe put a little more into US stocks?

I‚Äôm going all in on S&P 500 and *maybe* in 10 years all start to diversify to make it more conservative.   

I know TDF‚Äôs are popular here but I just don‚Äôt understand how it could underperform so badly.   This one year (13% in lost gains) probably set my retirement back 3-4 years. 

Edit:  just so you all don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ONLY looking at the last 1 year:

My TDF annual return over the last 10 years is 8.5%

S&P is 12%

So that‚Äôs a difference of 3.5% annually over 10 years which realllly adds up.   Basically my retirement portfolio would be 40% higher than it is now.

2nd Edit:  since this TDF‚Äôs inception in 2007, its annual return has been 6%.   S&P 500 over this time is 9%.  So 1.5x the returns.   This time period obviously includes the 2008 recession and S&P 500 is still waaay better.  "

I own Nvidia, so I admit, I am biased. But I think anyway you slice those numbers, they‚Äôre pretty damn impressive. If it‚Äôs a bubble, it‚Äôs a bubble that people are buying into. And by people, I mean, giant, multinational companies. It‚Äôs amazing growth for a company so large. 

I‚Äôm hoping this brings some calm back to the markets. We‚Äôve been pivoting between irrational exuberance and panic.

My larger retirement account made 11.2% today based on NVDA stock SMCI stock NVDA option and lots of ETFs. Probably no one will see this edit.

Pets.com? I know what a pet is..com makes it even better!

I remember the exact street I was driving on when the one trillionth radio advertisement for Amazon came on the radio. And I was like, what a stupid name for a bookstore. Amazon has nothing to do with books. And for years and years and years, Amazon, lost money. They only existed because that.com Bubble had lifted them so far they had Cash. Lotsa cash. But they were a joke for about a decade.

But the real big thing was almost none of those companies had a profit. They didn‚Äôt make any money whatsoever. None. No business. They were burning through cash with expensive offices, expensive staff, oh man, salaries for tech workers were astronomical.

The companies that did have a profit, we‚Äôre making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didn‚Äôt meet this criteria.

Cisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150.

If it‚Äôs a bubble, it‚Äôs nowhere near the size of the.com bubble. S&P 500 is P/E of 22. In 2000 it was 28.

As such, they make up a huge composition of market-weighted indices like the S&P and NASDAQ 100. Yesterday NVDA was up. Yesterday many other stocks were up.

Is there a causal relationship here?

It is clear that buying a stock within an index affects the index. It also clear that buying a fund that tracks the index also affects the stocks within the index. Every stock has a beta, which is the movement that can be explained via correlation to the overall market, and alpha, which is movement that is not explained via correlation to the overall market.

What I'm trying to understand is the nature of the relationship between NVDA vs indices ex-NVDA. Which of these is more true:

1) NDVA goes up -> causes indices to go up -> STOP. Movement in other stocks can be explained by other factors other than NVDA alone.

2) NVDA goes up -> causes indices to go up -> causes all stocks in the index to go up. A stock benefits simply by being tracked in the same index as NVDA,

Because this leads to an unintuitive conclusion in my head: given two stocks A and B that have zero alpha and high beta in unrelated sectors. News that affects the price of stock A causes an effect on the price stock B simply because of their beta values."

And we only have to look at the earnings call and how it snapped a sinking market back forward again adding more money to its cap in a day than any stock in history. 

Okay. Rah rah. But what about the competition? That much money and someone(s) are gonna try and steal a piece and poach your employees. 

So this one is for the nays and even the yays like me who want perspective. 

From MarketWatch opinion piece:

> The Nvidia bandwagon is packed and everyone is jumping on it. It‚Äôs fun to be right and more fun to be right in good company. But what if everyone is wrong? Isn‚Äôt it this type of mania and exuberance that should give the market pause? 

> Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition. This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%.

> over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia‚Äôs margins and the company‚Äôs ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate. 

> the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia‚Äôs largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.‚Äôs AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house. 

> not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk

> In short, competition is real and it is coming to Nvidia in a meaningful way. More competition pressures Nvidia‚Äôs pricing, margins and market share, as well as its rates of revenue and EPS growth. "
2024-02-26 19:48:12,Pablo-de-Engineer,Where are these billions going?,"So for the past 2 or so weeks, I have been reading about how Tuberville, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Musk, Dwayne Jhonson, Oprah, and many others have been dumping billions since December from the stock market.

I know most of them sell some annually just for cash and whatnot but it does not seem like the norm that is happening right now. I can not find out if or what they are buying into. I also saw Soros and Buffet sold all of their bank stocks completely. I think that might be due to the gov. ending funding on March 11th for the banks but I am not sure.

Some of this info may be outdated but the articles I read were between Oct. 23- Feb. 18th 24. So if I am misunderstanding something please let me know.

TLDR: If the billionaires sold so much then what are they buying?

Edit: Some of you seem confused about the post. As you can see I mention some people that are not known for their stock portfolios. I was not asking this question so I could go spend my small amount on whatever they are ""investing"" into. I was looking for interesting things that I did not see or understand. For example, the Zuckergburg farm and all the conspiracy around it have been hilarious and very enjoyable reads. Also learning about some of the technical ways Buffet moves money that I did not know about has also been interesting.

Basically, I am just asking so I can learn and have something enjoyable to read on subjects I don't fully understand. I am clearly not some financial guru. Just someone wanting a discussion on this topic of where all this cash is going. No reason to get all hot and bothered and belittle others on here who want to share their unique ideas or things they have read.

2024-03-05 09:58:27,bitkogan,"Why is gold at an all-time high, while gold miners' stocks are at the bottom?","The answer is simple - costs are rising faster than revenue. Let's look at Barrick Gold Corp.:

2016: All-in Sustaining Costs ($/oz) ‚Äì 674, Realized Price ($/oz) ‚Äì 1248. 2023: All-in Sustaining Costs ($/oz) ‚Äì 1335 (approx. x2), Realized Price ($/oz) ‚Äì 1948 (approx. x1.5).

As a result, gold prices increase, but miners' EPS doesn't see the same rise.

However, in the next year or two, the rise in gold prices could accelerate. It's already happening, even though rates have yet to be cut.

We might see a repeat of the 2020-21 story - gold reaching new levels with a sharp increase in free cash flow and EPS for miners.

I don't even know if that's how it works to be honest...

2024-04-14 09:52:25,SwellsInMoisture,"10 years ago, we discussed how we select stocks. Here's the 2024 version.","Hi /r/investing, roughly 10 years ago there was a great discussion about [how we select our stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ecl4v/how_do_you_search_and_find_good_stocks/).  I discussed my method - Trending Value - and that led to me sharing my results with many of you via a program I had written.  Well, that program broke and remained dormant for years... until now.

So what is Trending Value?  It's a method published by James O'Shaughnessey in his ""What Works on Wall Street"" book. During decades of backtesting, it generated over 21% annual returns with equal standard deviation to the total market.  It generated a lot of discussion and lead to [this follow-up thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1eyx3r/how_do_you_select_stocks_contd_trending_value_see/). In my mind, this method resonates the truest... far truer than those who advocate watching the check-out lines at your grocery store to see which products are being purchased. The method, summarizing is the following:

When you run a screen for stocks with good P/E or P/B, what do you look for? You find a stock with a P/E multiple of 12. Is this good? Is this bad? Neither and both, without a frame of reference. O'Shaughnessey's method rates 6 key financial metrics for every stock against the whole market to come up with a cumulative VALUE BASED score. Those metrics are: P/E, P/B, P/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, and Shareholder Yield, which is dividend yield + stock buyback yield (i.e. equity returned to the shareholder in some way).

All 6 metrics are ranked 0-100, where 100 is the ""best"" ratio in the stock universe, and 0 is the worst. The top 10% of stocks will typically have scores in the 420+ range. They are undervalued relative to the rest of the market.

However, just because a stock is undervalued DOES NOT mean that it's a good buy. It could be facing legal action, failing drug trials, having a CEO that just went to jail, or other event that can't be reflected in these numbers. That's where momentum comes into play.

We take the top decile of stocks and reorder them by 6-month price momentum. Invest equally in the top 25, hold for a year, liquidate, repeat. The companies you buy are undervalued and the market is rallying behind them. Back testing, while not a prediction of future results, yielded a 21.2% average ROI with this method.

Of course, there's no screener that does this, nor is there a way to even view ""Shareholder Yield"" in one location.

When I started this 10 years back, [I used MatLab to solve this problem](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46816-oshaughnessey_v5-m).  Yes, MatLab.  Wrong tool for the job.  Thankfully, ChatGPT has turned even amateur hobbyist coders into useful contributors, and a python version has been born.

I'll post the results of today's run below.  Feel free to ask for a specific stock and I'll post the results of that ticker.  Keep in mind, it is filtered to Market Cap > $200M and the name of the method is Trending VALUE - your growth stocks (NVDA, TSLA, etc) are going to be viewed very poorly.

Edit: You'll occasionally see a value like ""10000"" for P/E or another field.  That means the value was either missing or negative.  This is to artificially just kill that field for that ticker."
2024-04-16 07:26:20,reignmade1,Is it Time to Bail on Apple?,"Was wondering what the sub thinks about holding AAPL at this point. I've had it since November, 2017 and it's up about 270% from when I bought it. At it's highest my gain was about 300%. It's down ~11% this year.

It just seems a bit saturated. iPhone is getting shellacked in China. They've got a great ecosystem of products and loyal customer base with one of the strongest brands in the world, but it feels like growth is limited.

Just wanted to see what everyone thinks. I know it's never a bad thing to sell and claim profits, but I know I'd kick myself if it did well later on. 

Also not sure where is a better place to park that money. I was thinking Netflix, it's been gangbusters recently, but the streaming market seems very iffy. I've got GOOG, NVDA, AMD, MA, V, MSFT, and META and not sure if I want to increase my exposure to any of those as well as they've done.

2024-05-03 07:20:24,MapleByzantine,Do valuations even matter anymore for US stocks?,"More money is now in passive funds than active funds. Passive money doesn't care about valuations, it just blindly flows into the stock market based on existing company market caps.

Every two weeks, billions of dollars in retirement contributions flows into passive index funds. There's an ever greater supply of money flowing into passive instruments year by year and it doesn't care one bit about, say, NVDA being overvalued, it's going to buy NVDA based on it's current market cap relative to the rest of the market.

Moreover, the stock market is essentially a federally protected asset. Most Americans are relying on their portfolios to fund their retirement and so there's a case to be made that the federal government would always step in to avert a catastrophic crash.

2024-05-10 20:41:38,fireduckieman41,"If you had $500k-1M, what would you do to turn it into multi-millions? Medium to high risk answers only","Of course, there is no get rich quick scheme or else everyone would do it. But there is calculated high risks that could be taken to try and get multiples on your money in a relatively short amount of time (1-5 years). With $500k-$1M you could make pretty risky investments with potential huge returns. Assume your only goal is to become rich - as in you are not happy transitioning into a safer investment approach until you are at $5-10M (10x). Also assume you have a good job that is flexible enough to allow you to focus on your new endeavor and you have comfortable housing and basic needs covered where you don‚Äôt have to worry about ending up behind Wendy‚Äôs if you lost it all. It would suck losing all the investment money, but you are taking the risk in hopes to turn it in to life changing money. 

A few investment thoughts I had: 
- angel investment in start ups. You‚Äôd have to pick a winner which is hard of course, but definitely a way to 2-10x your initial investment if you get lucky. 
- invest in large real estate development. These aren‚Äôt usually just accessible to anyone, but if you happen to come across a development deal where it‚Äôs buying raw land to develop into a suburban neighborhood or building multi family/commercial, this would also be a way to 2x-10x your money depending on the deal. These funds work similarly to angel investments. There is either some syndication group that makes a fund to raise capital to buy land to develop into something and your investment gets you equity in the deal and this group would have a clear exit plan for how to return investors money. I think these deals are safer than angel investing, but harder to come across. 
- full time focus on trading. Stock market, crypto, whatever. With the stock market in particular you could have a (I know options is very high risk) a safer lower risk, longer expiration option trading strategy on large blue chip companies with very expensive contracts trading at a level that the average person just simply can‚Äôt trade on. For example, a $900 NVDA 3/25 call trading for a whopping $18k per contract. 
- buy a small online or physical business with the plan of investing significant capital in expanding the business heavily through marketing and acquiring assets to make it grow

Little background on me:
My wife and I bought a house every year since we were married. We had 3 by the time the Covid boom happened, all of them doubled in value. Sold one, bought 2 more that needed work and rehabbed them heavily and turned them into airbnbs - still early covid boom. We are relatively young (31 and 30), but lately we have been thinking, if it‚Äôs worth selling some property and trying alternative riskier investment strategies. Realistically, our homes are not doubling again in the next 5 years. We already received the ‚Äúlife changing‚Äù money benefit from making relatively smart real estate investments. The initial plan wasn‚Äôt to make a killing this quickly, but since we did maybe we should take some off the table and try our hand at something else. I get it, houses are a good long term buy and hold, especially since we have them at low interest rates. Yes, I also know we could do cash outs, but interest rates are higher now. We are young and could take ourselves to the next level with the proper risk and we are willing to consider it. Anyways, what kind of riskier investments would y‚Äôall look into?

EDIT and TLDR: if you had $500k-$1M what medium to high risk investment would you do? 

EDIT: I do not have that money, but I could if I sold some of my houses and I am curious what others would do if they had that money in cash. I know what the smart safe investments are already, that is not my interest. I am interested in serious discourse about calculated medium to high risk investments that I haven‚Äôt mentioned in my post. "
2024-05-25 02:43:19,carlinwasright,Still Obsessed with Chip Makers (Part 3),"This is my third quarterly post about chip makers. 6 months ago, SMH was around $160. 3 months ago, it was just under $200. Yesterday, it reached $244. I believe chips are still a great investment, even at this price, and I am continuing to buy more.

Along the way, many commenters have argued against chips, so this quarter I think I'd like to address the common themes I see in the comments, and explain why I think chips are still a great opportunity.

1: AI is a gimmick, or has very limited practical use, or is just a fancy auto-complete, and it won't drive growth in chips

This is probably the most common and upvoted argument I see. I have to guess that people making this argument either haven't experimented with AI themselves, or don't yet have a use for AI in their day to day lives.

For me, I use GitHub copilot every day. It is an incredible productivity boost. Developers that have used GitHub copilot understand how much value is there, and the rest of the world is just now catching up with things like Microsoft's recently announced Copilot+ (more on that in a minute). So if you want to argue that AI is a gimmick or fad, I'd ask that you also explain why you think millions of people will suddenly stop or decrease their use, rather than increase and expand their use of AI as it continues to get better.

2: We don't need more chips, soon there will be too much supply

Last time I saw this argument, I countered that even as data centers built up their AI capabilities, on-device demands were going to further strain supply. Since then, there have been several announcements about on-device chips, with Copilot+ (and the requirement of a chip that can do 40 TOPS) perhaps being the biggest and clearest example.

Very few devices today (laptops, phones, etc.) have enough processing power, or the right kind of processing power, to efficiently run a small LLM. Hence, the release of new chips like the M4 and the Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite, which were designed specifically to power small on-device LLMs. In my opinion, these chips are going to be a minimum system requirement going forward, and virtually every device will eventually be replaced with one that has one of these new chips.

3: It's a chip bubble, there's no fundamentals supporting the price

I'm a big believer in fundamental analysis, and if you look at chips through the lens of fundamental analysis, I see your point. NVDA is trading at over 60 P/E, and why would you buy that when there are other great companies trading at a much lower P/E.

The thing is, fundamental analysis is great for mature industries that are perhaps innovating on their operations, making them more efficient, but where there is not much actual product innovation. Fundamental analysis really breaks down when you have a rapidly evolving or completely novel product, a product so innovative it creates an all-new industry. For example, if you were thinking about investing in Amazon around 2010, fundamental analysis would have told you that the company is burning through cash, and their P/E ratio was in the high 60's, and that it wasn't a good value. Of course, the stock went on to grow by more than 20x since then. So much for fundamental analysis.

Fundamental analysis really falls short when it comes to new products that are so innovative they create their own industries. The companies creating these products tend to spend heavily on R&D, and the industry is not yet well-defined, so the company looks ""inefficient"" compared with mature companies operating in adjacent industries.

I think if it were say, three years ago, it would take a lot of imagination to see how AI is going to transform the chip industry. The tech wasn't there, and the value proposition wasn't clear.

2024-05-27 09:36:20,N9149U,Question about my LEAPS - NVDA & NFLX,"I bought a couple of LEAPS and am trying to understand the difference in their valuations.

NFLX 570 12-18-26 Call bought $169, current $218, 29% gain on LEAP.  Stock was $555 when LEAP was bought, current $647, gain if I bought stock 17%.

NVDA 800 12-19-25 Call bought $290, current $410, 41% gain on LEAP.  Stock was $762 when LEAP was bought, current $1065, gain if I bought stock 40%.

I understand the simpler straightforward aspects of options, but the greeks are greek to me.  

What accounts for the different relationships between these stocks and their options?  NFLX is +29% LEAP vs +17% Stock?  NVDA tracks much closer at +41% vs +40%.  Is it the difference in time - NFLX exp 12/**26** vs NVDA exp 12/**25**?

The previous 1 year update is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) Interestingly, the stock I lamented missing the run up on (Nvidia) is now by biggest holding and one of my best performers.

# Tracking progress

Below are the gains for this portfolio (opened in 2022) as of May 31, 2024.¬†

# Realized (sold)

**2023 Totals**

All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD).¬†

Peloton was a big loser and the only one I almost immediately regretted, but it was a relatively small investment that was more than offset by others.¬†

# Rate of return

The total rate of return since inception (June 2022 to May 2024) is¬†**77.90%**.¬†

# 3 ways my investing evolved

I‚Äôm still well within the ‚Äòmaybe I‚Äôm just lucky‚Äô phase since it‚Äôs only been a couple years, but I‚Äôve noticed I invest differently now than I have in the past:¬†

1. Insight¬†
2. Conviction¬†
3. Patience

**Insight**

I‚Äôve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views).¬†

Ben Graham‚Äôs quote rings true:¬†

>‚ÄúIn the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.‚Äù

Perhaps counterintuitively, I‚Äôve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.¬†

Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both.¬†

# Math

In 2023 I also started¬†practicing math daily¬†(243 days straight¬†as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I‚Äôd done any meaningful math.¬†

I‚Äôm not sure how much, but it¬†*feels*¬†like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not.¬†

**Conviction**

A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.¬†

However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.¬†

Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I‚Äôve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I‚Äôm not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I‚Äôm happy I did.¬†

A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial.¬†

This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise,¬†you must seize them.

**Patience**

As a result of my convictions, I‚Äôm much more patient in my investing these days and don‚Äôt react to the day-to-day.¬†

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I don‚Äôt make another trade for the rest of 2024.

**UPDATE:**

A commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:

I opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S&P return is \~28% (\~39% for Nasdaq). My cumulative return for that same period is around \~215%. The annual rate of return (per my Vanguard dashboard) is 77.9% as mentioned in the original post. I would expect my returns to revert to the mean over time."

2024-06-05 13:01:30,StatQuants,Nvidia briefly passes Apple as second most valuable public U.S. company,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-passes-apple-in-market-cap.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-passes-apple-in-market-cap.html)

[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)¬†briefly passed¬†[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/)¬†in market cap on Wednesday during intraday trading¬†as the chipmaker emerges as the primary beneficiary of the¬†[artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/)¬†boom. If it holds until the close, it will be the second most valuable U.S. company.

Nvidia hit a¬†[$3 trillion market cap](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-briefly-passes-3-trillion-market-cap-on-back-of-ai-boom.html)¬†milestone during intraday trading. Nvidia had a market value of $3.007 trillion at one point, versus Apple‚Äôs, which stood at $3.005 trillion.

Nvidia shares have risen over 24% since the company¬†[reported first-quarter earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2025-.html)¬†in May and have been on a tear since last year. The company has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, on which big tech companies spend billions.

Investors are also becoming more comfortable that Nvidia‚Äôs huge growth in sales to a handful of cloud companies can persist. For the most recent quarter, its data center business, which includes its GPU sales, rose 427% in a year to $22.6 billion in sales, about 86% of the company‚Äôs overall revenue.

Meanwhile, Apple shares are only about 5% this year, as Apple‚Äôs sales growth has stalled in recent months. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Apple said overall sales dropped 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% from the year-ago period. Apple faces strategic questions and issues about demand in China, manufacturing, and mixed reactions to its new virtual reality headset, Vision Pro.

Apple was the first company to reach $1 trillion and $2 trillion market caps. It has frequently been the most valuable U.S. company over the past few years but was again¬†[passed by Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-01-11/)¬†earlier this year. Microsoft has benefitted from the same investor demand for AI as Nvidia.

Nvidia‚Äôs stock has been more volatile than Apple. Founded in 1991, it was primarily a gaming company, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently it has sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services.

Nvidia shares have gone parabolic as its AI business has developed, rising over 3,290% in the past five years. It announced a¬†[10-1 stock split in May](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-announces-10-for-1-stock-split.html)."

But the real benefit will be companies who are highly inefficient and able to use this tech to cut waste/reduce costs and ramp up productivity.  Healthcare seems to be prime. 

  
Regardless, SSO or SPY not tech central might outperform.   IF AI is one of the final pieces to the puzzle, then clearly some tech plays will do well...but the net benefit is all the companies who can improve margins drastically and create a better customer experience.

2024-06-17 13:06:24,LateApostate,"NVDA will see a near term pullback, even though it doesn't deserve it ","NVDA will pullback in the near term, even though it's a great company that has consistently delivered for its shareholders. Why must it come down? Well, I'm a firm believer that narratives drive market sentiment, way more than fundamentals or valuations. Narratives, especially when repeated, permeate. And for the past 5 days, the narrative builders have been relentless in giving a negative short term assessment of NVDA stock. By narrative builders, I mean the financial industry people on TV asked to comment.

I will give you an example. On Friday, Jim Cramer alluded to NVDA being overbought and how Larry Williams' model was predicting a pull back of the stock until end of July.

This morning, Fairlead's Katie Stockton was also on Squawk Box, saying that even though she firmly believes in the bull market, NASDAQ 100 will see some pain as soon as people see that NVDA is a bit overstretched.

Just 30 minutes ago, Jeff Kilburg of KKM Financial called that it's time to trim, take profits given that the stock added 1 trillion dollars in valuation.

There are countless others from different sources. I really believe that once you start to hear so many ""experts"" and street people talk like this, it is reasonable to expect that a stock will come down. Not because they are right in their assessment but because others listen to it and start to wonder about trimming their positions in a self-fulfilling prophecy. This happens even if only in the very short term, before correcting to the upside and pushing higher to new highs.

I actually think we are seeing the very pullback already: today, on a day when the Nasdaq is rising by 1.2%, Nvidia has found resistance around 0.3% increase and seems to be headed lower. Recently, NVDA has been the one pushing Nasdaq to new highs, so just this inversion is noteworthy.

I am not a bear. At least not in that sense. And I do hope NVDA pulls back 10-20% because I intend to buy more. Cheers.

2024-06-17 18:13:47,AfraidScheme433,NVDA after stock split won‚Äôt be like TSLA,"
Whether NVDA is overvalued or not is up for debate, I have been hearing on Youtube that NVDA will drop after stock split just like TSLA did.  Let‚Äôs look into some figures for comparison:

regarding NVDA, the current market capitalization as of June 2024 is around $3T. This valuation makes NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world by market cap, even higher than the peak valuation of over $1 trillion for TSLA.

In October 2021, TSLA PE ratio was quite high, reflecting its growth expectations and market enthusiasm. The PE ratio was around 250.96 at the end of September 20211, and it likely remained in a similar range throughout October. The forward PE ratio, which is based on projected earnings, was also elevated, indicative of the optimism about the company's future performance.

As for NVIDIA, as of today, the current PE ratio is approximately 77.182. The forward PE ratio, which considers expected future earnings, is around 46.823 (TSLA at its peak:67.57). These values suggest that investors are expecting strong growth from NVIDIA as well."
2024-06-18 11:23:48,National-Ad8416,Getting on the AI bandwagon,"Hello Everyone, I am already invested in the SP500 through Vanguard (of which AI giants like Nvidia and Google form a major part). I am wondering if it makes sense to buy individual GOOG and NVDA stocks at this point in time (when valuations and prices are high). Alternately, I am also thinking about buying more affordable but promising AI companies (I wouldn't know which) using the philosophy that a rising tide lifts all boats. Or maybe an AI-based sector ETF?

I have never invested in individual stocks before (other than what was granted to me through RSUs) and am not even sure if a play like this makes sense.

Is what I am contemplating prudent? Any feedback (critical or otherwise) is welcome.

EDIT: Thanks for the very spirited discussion and the comments. I am not the type of person to take a plunge into individual stocks all that easily as staying invested in the SP500 has netted me great returns over the years. But there's this itch I feel like scratching hence considering this."
2024-06-18 18:01:44,phaskellhall,Selling NVDA with $1m gains,"I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm going to sell a portion of my Nvidia stock once I hit $1million profit. As of close today, I need an additional 22% increase to hit this threshold so it will likely happen before the end of the month or by the end of summer if things slow down/correct.    

A little back story, I bought my first shares in Feb  2017 for $2.77 and again in October for $4.86.  I‚Äôve continued to buy big chunks of it over the last 7 years because I thought GPUs would be needed for self driving cars.  Little did I know the Ai boom and to a smaller extent crypto would help Nvidia catapult to now the largest company in the world.  

My total cost basis is $34k and I‚Äôm sitting right around $850k.  Gains are around 2600% which is insane.  

I still have more conviction that Ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so I‚Äôm a bit torn on actually selling any of it.  If I sold all the other years people told me Nvidia had mooned, well I wouldn‚Äôt be sitting on the gains I have today.  My gut is telling me to only sell 1/3 of my holding but I have no idea where else to rotate this into.  I‚Äôm also in a unique tax situation where all my gains on this trade are locked into 0% which makes it tempting to let it ride for another year or two for a true FATfire setup.  As with any compounding interest, once the snowball gets to this point, smaller 2-5% moves really move the needle (in both directions).  

Anyways, just want to share this with someone since I can‚Äôt really mention this to most of my friends without it affecting our relationship.  It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs real guess what will happen with Nvidia in the future so I can‚Äôt imagine anyone can persuade me one way or another on this trade.  I‚Äôve experienced similar gains on Tesla but failed to sell at the top and now only have a portion of my gains on that stock so I know when a bubble feels like a bubble and this is definitely in that territory now.

Investing in upcoming stock splits - Chipotle, Broadcom, Sony.

I feel like this could be a good short-ish term play to try and capitalize on the splits. Open to thoughts on this. 

Other thoughts would be watching AMD as the stocks been hammered due to the alleged data breach, so keeping an eye on this and catching it during the dip could be good. I‚Äôm very interested in companies competing with Nvidia right now, such as AMD and intel which both have chips that claim to compete with Nvidias.

Then they both probably recover.  So if I diversify, I'd take a 1/3 haircut and then a 20-25% haircut in a worst case scenario vs. 50% haircut in my non-diversified position.  Same end result.  Am I missing something?  Best case, the mega-cap tech stock continues to do better or same as SPY.  I keep the position, and sell bit by bit later when my tax rate is lower, or I gift it to my kids."

2024-06-29 15:23:03,Apprehensive_Two1528,Using nvda shares to Pay off mortgages. good or bad ideas? ,"My mortgage is an ARM that resets the rate to 7.885% in september.

I have roughly the same worth amount of nvda shares plus a few other stocks and index funds. The nvda shares alone can pay off the mortgage balance

If you were me, would you pay off your 7.89mortgages using proceeds from nvda shares?

If not selling nvda, would you pay it off with cash. i also have about same amount of cash at sideline.

I do have 12 month emergency funds in t bills, so not in a big urgent need for that cash

06 29 Edit:

Thanks every one who replied. This post gave me great insights.

Based on every remarkable reply in this post, here is the adjusted decision.. ( i was proning to completely pay off using sideline cash).

Here is the adjusted decision

I will pay 1/2 to 2/3 outstanding mortgage balance with cash on hands.

I will leave the rest 1/2 to 1/3 to reset to the higher 7.885% rate.

Reason being: 1) Last 30 year s&p average return is 10% ish a year. I have a good opportunity for the 2% opportunity gain in next a few years which I belive we are still in a cyclical bull market and has more than 50% chance to gain double digit next years.

2) the 7.885% reset would stay 12month only. i believe FED will cut rate soon, so the 7.885% would reset to a 7% apr in 2025 September and even further down in 2026. Then the opportunity gain for Not payinb off will be greater in 2025.

3) My NVDA shares would have tax implications and it‚Äôs really not worth selling at this level.

4) I need a small mortgage to prevent real estate fraud. A mortgaged house usually won‚Äôt get scammed since banks have crazy checks on documents..

2024-06-30 15:50:31,XShadowSlayerX3,Dad has made 2% annual yield from his financial advisor. What advice do I give him? ,"Edit: Please see my newest post!!! I‚Äôve updated with figures and portfolio. 

Hello all,

My dad, 3 years ago, gave a financial advisor who he hired through his bank about $300k of capital to invest with. 

Since then the total yield has been about 6% on that money, about a 2% annual yield. Which my dad‚Äôs friends have told him is ridiculously low. 

I asked to take a look at my dad‚Äôs portfolio and a lot of the company‚Äôs are no names and the portfolio is many pages long, I can add pictures of the portfolio in the comments if that‚Äôs any help.

This is not to mention that the 401k he has given said financial advisor about $800,000 in over the course of 10 years, which has him at about a total of 1.2 million right now. I would imagine is also a very low yield. His friend has told him that the total PROFIT he should have made off of that amount should have been 1.8/1.9 mil. 

He has absolutely 0 knowledge on anything investing, but has decided to have a talk with his financial advisor on what he‚Äôs paying him for exactly. What should he tell his financial advisor? Fire him? I hate that he might be getting taken advantage of, and I would much appreciate if anyone had any advice on what he should do with his money at this time. My father is 57, I am 19.

2024-08-30 20:12:11,dukerustfield,Nvidia‚Äôs massive stock buyback,"From MarketWatch. 

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-stock-buyback-plan-is-one-of-the-biggest-of-2024-is-that-a-good-thing-9beba5c5?mod=djem_mwnafterbell

> The semiconductor company announced alongside its earnings on Wednesday that it has boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion. That‚Äôs double the size of the $25 billion share-repurchase program announced a year ago

> Looking beyond the year, Nvidia‚Äôs announcement is tied for the 12th-largest [stock buyback] on record. The company is one of only seven in the U.S. to have announced a buyback program of $50 billion or more. The buyback authorization is 1.7% the size of Nvidia‚Äôs market capitalization, which is about $2.91 trillion.

I tend to like stock buybacks. I like them more than dividends. The company has enough faith in itself that it wants to secure more of its own profits.  If you‚Äôre spiraling down in the dumpster, there‚Äôs really no need to buy back‚Äî especially if you believe this is the High Point and it‚Äôs only going down from here.

Nvidia has a number of problems. One is that it has a gigantic amount of cash. It was estimated that within three years it might be able to turn out 270 billion in free cash flow

But as the big player in the market, both its own specific market and the broader market, it‚Äôs gonna have a real tough time making big deals. Meaning deals significant enough to affect the bottom line.

It‚Äôs in the old-school Microsoft phase where everything it does is gonna be examined for antitrust. Can you imagine if they tried to buy AMD or something like that? It‚Äôs never gonna happen even if it made sense and didn‚Äôt destroy competition. 

So they‚Äôve got infinite money and kind of very finite things to do with it. their purchases of other companies has been around 300 *million* this year. Which is entirely insignificant.

However, I worry that the stock is insanely expensive. It‚Äôs noted that this gives them the option to pull the trigger whenever they want. So if there is a downturn, that‚Äôs good news for them because they‚Äôll be able to spend triple digit billions buying themselves back.

So in one sense, you can look at this as potentially bad news. Meaning they expect enough volatility, including down swings, to make it possible and profitable to have the 12th largest buyback in history.  

OR they feel they aren‚Äôt gonna drop and this is just a low point of a forever-climbing stock price.

Either way it‚Äôs good for Nvidia, but it makes it tough for investors to predict. If this was anyone else, I think it would be a little bit easier, but there‚Äôs so much money and the scale is so vast that it‚Äôs hard to wrap my head around. 

If they had been able to buy the dip a month or so ago, it‚Äôs astounding how much money they would‚Äôve made. Not to mention securing more of their future profits.

Obviously, companies of this size don‚Äôt move that fast and they aren‚Äôt playing a shell game. So it‚Äôs merely just a thought experiment to see how much money they would‚Äôve created out of a blip.

Lots of companies do buybacks, and lots of high-tech companies do buybacks. And the timing of it can generally illuminate a lot of things. But in this instance, I‚Äôm having a tough time seeing through it. 

In the past, they haven‚Äôt been a really savvy financial company. They‚Äôre not doing all kinds of tricks and schemes and mergers and things to burn short sellers and whatever. They‚Äôve just been ‚Äúboring‚Äù R&D and managed to get ahead of at least three or four massive shifts in technology in the world economy. 

The stock split. I had kind of considered it surprising. It just didn‚Äôt fit who they‚Äôve been up to this point. Why does it matter if they‚Äôre 3000 or 100? I suppose it‚Äôs nice that more of the unwashed can get in on the purchase. But it seems to be a small distinction. Like how many people could afford a few hundred bucks but not a few thousand bucks? AND are buy and hold stock investors. I said at the time it wasn‚Äôt gonna move the needle whatsoever. But beyond that, I just don‚Äôt really see the point.

As I‚Äôve said, there‚Äôs a lot of reasons to do a stock buyback. But this magnitude and at this price have left me guessing.

I like to think it‚Äôs optimism of their future. And that two years from now the stock is going to be much higher. In which case it made perfect sense to buy now.

That‚Äôs my hope anyways.

Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA‚Äôs prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks.

They essentially got to the point where they just added [dot.com](http://dot.com) to companies that never had a chance of profitability. Not only does NVDA have earnings but their main concern is just keeping up with demand. The only real concern I see about NVDA is whatever administration enters office within the start of the new year and how they deal with China and Taiwain especially because of Taiwains impact on the semi-condcutor industry with TSMC as the leading producer of semi-conductors especially because Intel cannot keep up and is being left behind.

Obviouly, NVDA is the largest in the AI space, but I see it as more of a stable growth play due to its already dominant position in the AI market.

2024-11-23 08:50:13,TheCuriousBread,Isn't rebalancing selling your winners and keeping your losers?,"I've been thinking about the philosophy of rebalancing. The purpose of rebalancing your portfolio (just buy all stocks bro, excluded) is to maintain a risk profile that's consistent with your goals. 

So say if NVDA went up by 300% and INTC got halved and now NVDA is 80% of your portfolio. The philosophy of rebalancing would demand you to sell a large portion of NVDA and invest in INTC. 

That strategy if we look at the chart, doesn't work so well for your wallet. 

So here's me wondering if rebalancing on the surface is ""buy low sell high"" when in reality it's just ""sell your winners and buy more losers"". 

On the converse with an outsized NVDA position you just increased your risk on one company big time so if NVDA gets hit by say an antitrust or Jensen's brain scan AI go Skynet, you're gonna get decimated. 

There's a lot of moving gears in this decision. "
