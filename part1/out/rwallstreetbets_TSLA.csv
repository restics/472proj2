2024-03-14 08:34:37,RobOReilly,It's time to buy $TSLA ($165). My bull case.,"Current Price: $165.  

I'm a value investor, but TSLA has finally reached a price today ($165) I consider a steal.  Everyone should have at least 1-5% of their portfolio in TSLA at these prices.   No doubt the stock has short term problems.  From slowing China sales, to Hertz dropping it, to slowdown in German production.  And that is already reflected in the price. In 6 months, it’s dropped almost in half from $299 to $165.  But there are some major long term points the market is missing:

Robotaxis.  

I believe there is at least a 50% probability that Tesla has an Nvidia-like moment w/in the next ten years when the first Tesla robotaxis hit the streets. Imagine Tesla makes a car for $20K.  That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself).  That car could easily generate $50K annually.  That’s a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.  

They made 1.85M cars in 2023.  Up 38% YOY.  If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years.  Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year.  That's $375M+ in revenue.  It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue.  That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. 

Other EV Pain is Tesla’s Gain.

Tesla dropped prices largely because they can, unlike the other EV makers. The legacy autos (ie Ford, GM) and even new rivals (ie Rivian) don’t have any margins on EVs yet.  They actually lose money by making them. So the competition is getting frustrated and giving up. That’s making people believe the whole industry is hurt.  But that pain is actually gain for Tesla, in the form of future market share. And it shows just how high a mountain they already climbed.  Nobody else can figure out how to make EVs profitably.  Tesla is one of the best run companies in the world and that’s how they accomplished it. They have some of the best engineers and maintain a very lean operation.  

Fair Value

If you believe that in the next ten years Tesla will be a trillion dollar company, you should buy at these prices.   If we discount at a 5.5% rate, 1,000,000,000 / 1.055^10 = $585M, which would correlate to a Tesla stock price of $184.19 (because there are 3.176M shares outstanding).  I personally believe that Tesla is going to be a $2T or even $3T company.  Discounting the previously mentioned $1.875T market cap would land at a current price of $345."

2024-03-22 04:27:53,PewPewDiie,The insane $TSLA bull case no analyst sees coming yet,"BUCKLE UP MFKERS, I GOT THE SCOOP FOR THE NEXT MOONING (AS BIG AS AI WAS)

**TLDR (cuz who here can actually read):** Idgaf about TSLA as a car company, soon noone else will too. Due to China and nerds making insane tech, humanoid robotics will be HUGE by late 2024. TSLA the company that will win this race. Market will realize in a cuppa months. Market for this is 20-100T USD with infinite growth potential. TSLA is quietly becoming the NVIDIA of humanoid robotics.

AI hype has hit the street, you know what that calls for: it's time to pivot to what the old f\*cks on the street is blind to (cuz they're so old).

Humanoid robotics. Any hedge fund manager would laugh, that's why it's genius.

1. Robotics has been around for a long time, but try programming a robot the same way you program a computer and ofc it will fail. It can't reason the way we reason. Since AI popped off, robotics has been reaping the rewards. While yall sleeping, terminator is being built. Check rate of progress from 2022 -> 2024, it's insane and show no signs of slowing.
   1. This is not the boring toyota drunk robots that can't do sh\*t. This is solid progress made at supersonic speeds on making robot workers for real. There is no limits to this actually working, it's an engineering problem at this point and a matter of time.
2. Ofc Xi Jing Ping is sharper than any of the dementia patients sitting in congress. China makes savvy decisions and guess what their plan is: **500 humanoid robot workers / 10 000 ppl by 2025. That is** **3.8 million humanoid robots.** They have put their money where their mouth is and gone b a l l s deep on investment into this. They are showing good results and making insane progress quickly.
   1. The implications here alone are huge: China US rivalry won't die anytime soon. This will force the hand of the US. A trump win would be huge as he can see stuff like this coming. He just needs to talk about it to legitimize the industry, and he surely will.
3. The market for humanoid robots is as big as the market for manual labour as long as the bots can perform the tasks efficiently. Analysts forecasts don't count towards the trajectory we are on. IE THE MARKET IS CURRENTLY 30% OF WORLD GDP WITH NEAR INFINITE GROWTH POTENTIAL.

Here is why TSLA will be a huge winner in this.

* Name of the game in AI is training data, talent and compute. Tesla has huge training data advantage as their vision models already are extremely good.
   * They have already chugged away at this problem for years and years as the chip needs to be inside the robot, and not in some huge gpu datacenter. Guess what they have in their cars: A lightweight, energy efficient chip for exactly this type of processing.
   * They have the human talent and is well regarded in the AI industry. Altough Grok so far has sucked, Elon realizes that it's immensily important to get this model smarter and is putting heavy focus on that. This is directly to augment their tesla bots with reasoning capabilities. Grok is specifically designed to solve reasoning unlike other AI models where the focus is more towards workplace efficiency.
   * They already have a multimodal model with language understanding inside their bots.
   * We should see actually useful humanoid bots working in their factory this year. They will 100% use them internally a lot before selling anything. After proper field tests and refinement the market will be GASPING for these bots. They don't even need to be anywhere as close to good as perfect, they just need to be as good as 70iq darren in minnesota doing the same repetitive task over and over again. We already have that intelligence in language models today.
* Lack of AI day: To quote deranged Elon: *"" Some of our competitors look at what we do on a frame by frame basis. The same happened with Battery Day. So we have to be a little cautious, but some kind of update would be good to do. Will discuss with the team, maybe something later this year. Our main goal with these AI Day things is recruiting and to change the perception of Tesla as a car company.""*
   * Essentially, AI day has not happened bcause they don't want to give up their competitive edge, not because of lack of progress. Once Investors realize TSLA are capable as an AI company, market will reflect that.
* Manufacturing. Idc if figure01 from figureAI is good as balls, they have ZERO experience in manufacturing. Manufacturing these bots will be the hard problem to solve. There is no better company set up for this than TSLA. (MSFT is bull case long term too btw)
   * TSLA CAN TEST THESE BOTS LIVE IN THEIR OWN FACTORIES WHILE DEVELOPING, THE ADVANTAGE IS ENOURMOUS. Having integrated development for exactly the type of customers they would sell to once it's mature.
   * TSLA has walked the road of going from startup to one of the leading EV manufacturers. They continually develop their manufacturing processes, taking insane risks to make it more efficient. THERE IS NO OTHER COMPANY BETTER SET UP TO GET MASS PRODUCTION OF THESE BOTS GOING ONCE THEY'VE REACHED A VIABLE PRODUCT
* Chinese competition: China might very well beat tsla to the punch in this, this is good. Why? Because US would NEVER rely on china to make them their robots. They will turn this into a case of national security faster than i can inseminate my 5'2 mewtoo build gf.

And I haven't even gotten to the best part yet: it doesn't matter if these robots can take over the world or not, ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT INVESTORS AT SOME POINT THINK THEY CAN. Riding the hype 'bubble' is irrelevant, only thing that matters is being ahead of the bubble.

As engineer, I see no reason that this will be a bubble, just a matter of time. What will be tricky is getting manufacturing up to scale, but from a moon case scenario - that doesn't fkn matter. All that matters is a belief that it will happen and tsla stock price will reflect it. There is NO DOUBT that they are the US company best set up to do this.

**MY POSITION:** Call options for TSLA 350 by dec 2025. (retrad bookie won't let me go higher)

**MY PREDICTION:** TSLA anywhere from 400 - Nvidia levels of valuation (750+) by late 2025. Short term we prolly won't see any gains on tsla due to this development hasn't gotten any hype yet but sometime this late summer / fall (Elon time accounted) we should see the hype about this getting started for real.

Why listen to me? **Don't,** you will jinx my positions."

BYD executives announced on Wednesday the automaker will begin selling its Dolphin Mini electric vehicle (EV) in Mexico at 358,800 pesos ($20,990). 

If Elon’s plan to compete with BYD is to ask the president to put 100% tariffs on BYD imports, that’s not a good working plan. As I understand, there’s a limit to tariffs and then it goes to WTO for arbitration. Another problem is China can retaliate with its own sanctions & tariffs!

I have been saying for a long time now, Tesla needs a CEO who can focus on the car, customers & shareholders instead of X, fighting with media and its main customers - the liberals who have almost completely abandoned Tesla. IMO, the way things are going Tesla may go down below $125 soon. Long term, I’m still optimistic on Tesla, unfortunately it has become one manchild dependent company with a spineless board.

2024-05-17 07:32:12,greenandycanehoused,What happens to TSLA earnings if 56 billion to Elon?,"There is a vote on June 13, regarding 56 billion dollar pay to Elon Musk, which was called into question by a judge in Delaware.  All over the news so let’s assume you already know and don’t need the link.  

Either:

 A) shareholders vote yes and board gives Elon musk 56 billion.  In this scenario, TSLA earnings go down by 56 billion.  Is this already priced in or does TSLA stock drop accordingly?  

Or, 

B) shareholders vote no and the board gives it to him anyway.  Or maybe the board sided with unhappy shareholders and face the wrath of an epic Elon musk tantrum? In this scenario, TSLA shareholders are unhappy and jump ship either way.  Is this already priced in or does TSLA stock crater to more realistic numbers?

I’m very interested to hear if there are alternative scenarios where the stock price isn’t impacted by this vote on June 13?  

It seems the June 13 vote (I think they need to report results within 4 days) will be more consequential than any earnings report, right?

2024-06-10 12:00:58,red1990corvette,Musk Pay Package is a lose/lose for TSLA,"I believe the upcoming TSLA shareholder's meeting could be a lose/lose for the company.  At issue: whether shareholders believe Musk should receive his $56B pay package (originally agreed in 2018 and struck down by a Delaware judge earlier this year).  Proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against approving the package, and many institutional investors have followed their lead.  Still, a majority (56%) of those [surveyed](https://www.teslarati.com/morgan-stanley-survey-tesla-investors-will-ratify-elon-musk-2018-comp-plan/) said they expect the proposal to be approved.

However, whichever way this vote goes, I expect a negative outcome for TSLA.  There's one of two outcomes:

**A) Musk Pay Approved**

* If the pay package is approved, it would bring Musk's ownership of the company close to 25% and dillute all other shareholders by 10%.
* For many shareholders I expect this to be the last straw for them.  Those who vote against the package will see this as musk trying to extract as much value as he can from a dying company.  Especially after this year's sales slowdown (Hertz is [selling](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/06/ev-sales-slump-hertz-dump-take-used-tesla-to-no-haggle-25000-price.html) off its Tesla fleet, admitting the move was a mistake) and axing of the entire supercharger team.  Not to mention Musk's continued shitposting [alienating](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/elon-musk-turned-democrats-off-tesla-when-he-needed-them-most-176023af) desperately needed democrat buyers.

**B) Musk Pay Denied**

* If the pay package is denied, I think it would indicate the beginning of the end for Tesla.  Musk has already said that he would shift his focus to his other companies if he doesn't get his $56B.
* He has threatened to develop AI at one of his other companies instead, and has already admitted to diverting Nvidia GPUs from Tesla to xAI and Twitter.
* Musk has been the primary driving force behind Tesla, and without his presence and constant hype I think his diehard supporters will begin to reevaluate their ownership of Tesla stock, leading to a major selloff.

This is after the price cuts, low interest rate offerings, and discounts. Demand just isn’t there and they do not have enough time to turn things around.


Margins keep getting tighter and tighter, falling to levels similar to other automotive companies. “But but FSD and robotaxi”. FSD hasn’t had the perceived success they thought it would have - people just like driving their cars and the extra value isn’t there for the normal person. Robotaxi won’t be ready this year, I’d be surprised if it’s ready next year - this is the most obvious sell the news out there, especially based on Tesla’s track record of over-promising and hyping things up. 


They currently have nothing in their financials but “hope” that signals a turnaround. Fundamentals clearly show TSLA is overpriced and I expect a tank in the near term. Oh and once the Delaware judge validates the attorney fees Tesla will have to pay those attorneys in billions worth of options which will almost assuredly be sold. Good luck to TSLA bulls but things aren’t looking good.

2024-07-23 11:27:10,GrowYourConscious,Why I'm playing TSLA puts today,"Guys, we have an insane earnings week and I just wanted to put in my two cents for TSLA today. 

Here’s what they're expecting:

* Earnings per share: 62 cents expected

* Revenue: $24.77 billion expected

Just for comparison:  A year ago, Tesla reported 91 cents of EPS and sales of $24.9 billion. First and formost, I'm getting a put spread. Not puts. IV is just way too high for just puts. Spreads reduce the IV and focuses more on the underlying. But why puts? The stock actually PUMPED hard last earnings. Well, let me explain. 

Lower sales volume and vehicle prices are behind the expected decline. Tesla delivered about 444,000 vehicles in the second quarter at an average realized price of $42,500. A year ago, the company shipped about 466,000 vehicles at an average price of about $44,000.

There's really no indicators telling me that they're doing better as a constant decline in sales will probably continue well into 2025. Just look at the headlines. Musk's cybertruck is a complete failure. The tesla semi is a dud. The tesla roaster isn't out and will never be out. And his other projects? Hyperloop, solar panel shingles? All busts. 

Yea I'm expecting a >10% drop today. TSLA 7/26 240p is just a bit too expensive for an earning play, so this is why I'm getting the spread. Buying the 240p while selling the 225p (same exp) seems like a smart choice to me. I can grab the spread for 477 bucks right now at the time of writing. Meaning, if TSLA drops as much as I expect today, this spread should profit over 3x. Good luck!"

2024-09-05 17:44:30,Minai808,LLY is beating out TSLA to become a Trillion Dollar company,"LLY is set to become the 1st trillion dollar health-care stock. Eli Lilly has been having major wins since their earnings. Their drugs are no longer in shortage, Zepound was found to have cardiovascular benefits, and their once a week insulin is showing equal results to daily insulin injections.

The cardiovascular benefits from zepound is huge because patient insurances are more likely to cover drugs like this, without patients having to try other medications since it’s an actual benefit that no other fat loss meds have and it help lower the risk of their patients being in the hospital, which will save insurance companies more money at the end.

The weekly insulin is HUGE. The biggest complaints patients have is the amount of times they have to inject themselves throughout the day. The benefit this will have, is that both type 1 and type 2 diabetics can use this and there is a smaller risk of hypoglycemia/lower blood sugar since there’s no defined peak with the insulin.

https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/lilly-weekly-insulin-efsitora-phase-3-data-lantus-tresiba/726155/

I’ve been a diabetic pharmacist for the last 10 years and I’ve been lucky to be making over 40k on LLY options.(see my previous posts)

I feel like this is the lowest LLY will get before it shoots up, tomorrow would be a perfect time to get in IMO with shares, not options (wait till Monday). Thank you for attending my TED talk. Thank me later. "
2024-09-08 13:09:31,Ok_Bodybuilder_2384,Calling the top on $TSLA. Change my mind,"1. Sales. Tesla sales are down, and I think they will keep falling. There’s no EV winter, Ford etc. are doing fine. People are buying EVs, just not Teslas.

2. Leadership. Musk has spread himself too thinly. Spends his days tweeting random conspiracies, aside from running idk how many side companies. Seems he has shiny object syndrome and clearly the attention isn’t on Tesla right now.

3. Competition. Chinese EVs are better. Cheaper. He said it himself. Americans will eventually catch on and shift to those. 

4. Regulations. Trump gets elected, he will favor fuel/hybrids. He could’ve made Biden-Harris his allies as they clearly care more about climate change, EV stuff - but he’s alienated them more than ever. 

He’s also alienated his core customer base (climate conscious left-wing folks, right wing folks mostly think EVs are gay)

5. His public (mis)behavior. Going on full jousts with the biggest western governments while cozying up with the dictatorships (Saudi, Turkey) won’t serve him. His lack of content moderation and refusal to cooperate with the world’s largest govs can cost him big. See Pavel Durov’s current situation. 

6. Stock price. Tesla is overbought. Has been for a while. Was fine when it was seen as the highest growth EV contender, but its subsiding with competition. He’s been pushing for it to be valued as an AI company but it’s not happening. The $56bn payout that was just approved shows he probably thought that money was more productive out the company versus reinvested.

7. X is bleeding cash. He’ll probably sell some $TSLA stock to reinject money into it since he’s not letting it go bankrupt and most likely won’t sell it either.

Based on the above. I call a top.
Thoughts?"
2024-09-23 17:37:13,bignoze,Who thinks TSLA is going to miss earnings because cars are stored everywhere. ,"TSLA is having an enormous problem. First off I live in Austin and I drive by the plant every once in a while. They have cars stacked 4 and 5 high, looks like almost a 1,000 if not more. Cybertrucks too. They have finally caught up to demand and now have way too much supply. The CyberTruck is a dud. I canceled my order, so did everyone else I know. The Model Y and 3 seem to sell well but I rarely see a new model X or Y. So the high end has stopped moving. Plus they have lowered the prices so much they have destroyed the high margins they were making. Plaid has gone from almost $140k to less than $100k. That’s a lot of profit gone. Tesla dealerships have them stored to the Moon. Same thing cars stacked 4 and 5 high and parked all over the place. At other Dealerships I am being told by friends who live in other parts of the Country that it’s worse. 

The entire car industry is having massive issues but Ford and GM are not valued at 60xs forward earnings. 

I think Elon is going to try to preempt the Earnings disaster with his “RoboTaxi” announcement on the 10th. 1 week before earnings on the 16th. Try to ride the “AI” hype. 

Power-walls don’t sell, Solar does not pencil out, and they are not building a robot anytime soon.

But they still can’t make my dam Roadster, been on order for 4 years plus. 

Me thinking of taking out a nice Put position for the 16th. Short term Puts will be cheap and stock has rallied back over $250. Perfect timing to knock $50 bucks off the stock. 

That’s what happened last time.

Thoughts WSB wizards?

TSLA Puts, out of the Money, for the Win? 

Or don’t bet against Elon. I am a huge fan but I can do math too and theirs just does not add up."

2024-10-05 10:51:32,2CommaNoob,Robotaxis will not be a trillion dollar business,"I fail to see the trillions business that Musk and all the analysts parroting for robotaxis.  It’s a stupid idea built on fantasies.  Here’s my argument:

1. Every single Tesla owner I know won’t lend out their cars. The lending out is the stupidest idea ever.  Every car owner I know won't lend out their car either.  Tesla will have to run their own fleet which will increase costs, maintenance etc.
2. Percentage of people willing to take a robotaxi daily are low; like Uber.  At best; it’s will be an Uber like service with limited use cases:  Traveling, airports, designated drivers etc.
3. Costs are astronomical when you add up all your small daily trips.  Two kids household in the US suburbs with limited public transportation.  I take approximately 8-10 roundtrips a day, sometimes more on the weekends.

For example: $7 per trip according to Musk: commute(2), kids school(2), kids activities(2-4), leisure or Starbucks or McDonald’s or family visits(2). $60-80 per day= $1500+ per month and that’s assuming every trip is $7.  Why not just own a car at    that price?

Edit: I forgot to add the emotional, pride and freedom of owning a car.  US consumers love their cars and trucks more so than guns.  A lot of people will die rather than give up their cars.

Edit: All the pro responses are parroting the same spiel that Musk, Woods and analysts are spewing.  No examples, no numbers, no market.  It's ""Believe me, it will happen"".  Same as the metaverse, Vision Pro, 3D printing, 3D TV which were all touted as the next big thing but ended being a limited market.

Their car and energy businesses will be fine but the trillions robotaxi business has always been a fantasy.   This ain’t about the stock price or where it’s going.  TsLA never traded on fundamentals anyway.  "

In 1 year, when it rolls off the production line, you will be able to hail a Robovan, configured to have a bedroom. It will pick you up in the city center, in the evening, and you will sleep in it, while it drives you outside of the city. It will find parking and drop you off at 8 AM in front of your workplace, with a hot coffee and breakfast, which will have been delivered into the Robovan while you slept. I believe this is 1-2 years away.

Imagine you can live in a robovan for $8 a day (or $1 per hour)...basically IN THE CENTER of New York. That's $2800 per year, or $140,000 in a lifetime. You wouldn't be able to buy a cardboard box in NY for that price.

2024-10-23 11:40:15,Deja_ve_,$TSLA: The DD of a lifetime. ,"Hello, everyone! As we all know, $TSLA is having their quarterly earnings, which is a big deal for some bears. But let’s crack down on the bear party just for a second and use *logical* reasoning for why TSLA might not end up in the gutter as many would think. 

1. Expectations are low, just like Q1 (will get back to this later).
2. Their shittiness is priced in already after Robotaxi event.
3. Elon Musk is a master stock manipulator. 

Keeping all of this in mind, this isn’t even the *real* part of this DD. The actual, most integral part is looking at Elon Musk’s Twitter, which I decided to keep a close look on the past couple of earnings reports. 

On the day of Tesla’s Q1, Elon Musk tweeted a total of 5 times, where the stock ended up going up 13% and then an additional 16% the next 2 weeks. 

On the day of Tesla Q2, Elon Musk didn’t tweet **anything**, and the stock ended up falling 14%. 

Seems like a pattern has been drawn up, huh? Elon tweets a bit when the Tesla stock is going to moon on earnings while he’s in a cocky mood, and is dead silent when Tesla is going to fall. 

Now guess how many times Elon Musk has tweeted *so far* today? 

*15 fucking times*. 

You heard that right, folks! 15 GODDAMN times. That’s triple the amount of tweets he had made on Q1, where the stock roared 13 - 15%! Meaning that Elon is much more confidence and cockier than he was in Q1! This man knows when his stock will fall and when it doesn’t, and he’s letting us know right below our own nose! 

All of this is a *clear* indicator that Tesla is going to the moon today and the next week to come, regardless of whether they beat estimates or not. I’m betting that Tesla WILL beat estimates simply because of Elon Musk’s tweets and the fact that everyone has low confidence in the stock as of late. 

This is your DD to buy calls. Whether you want free money or not is up to you. 

Positions: 15 minutes before market close, I’ll buy 3 217.5C exp. OCT. 25th. 

*note*: This is NOT financial advice. Any losses on $TSLA options deep OOTM is a result of your regardedness, not mine. "

2024-10-23 16:02:11,Specific_Concern649,It is very clear to me that WSB goes full regard when it comes to TSLA.,"Never go full regard. Stop letting your hate for musk cloud your already ill advised judgment. I’m mad because time and time again every time this dumb sub says to buy puts on TSLA, I do and I’ve finally learned my lesson.


These things are true:


1) Cybertruck is not a failure. Demand is still high.


2) FSD continues to improve and is postured better to scale than any of its competitors including wAyMo. FSD is transformational, a lot of you boneheads just refuse to admit it. FSD will be successful. But “muh LiDaR”. Shut up. You know nothing about sensors, inference, AI, etc.


3) Tesla will be the king of EVs for the foreseeable future. No competitor is even close.


4) Tesla continues to print money and hoard money. All this talk about “TSLA doesn’t trade on fundamentals only musk failed promises” is equally regarded. They’ve been successful at reinvesting in areas where they either created demand or already have demand. TSLA is a successful fucking company, deal with it, idiots.


5) “But musk is a liar who manipulates the stock”. Shut up. TSLA isn’t a conspiracy. This often referenced “cult” doesn’t have enough money combined to move the stock $1.


6) Robotaxi will turn out to be a success.


7) Optimus is also postured to scale for practical use better than any of its competitors. It will also be a success.


In other words. I’m done listening to you losers."

2024-10-25 09:28:46,jiaperligh,TSLA shares add billions to Elon Musk's net worth,"Elon Musk's net worth is estimated to have grown by tens of billions of dollars on Thursday, when Tesla ( TSLA ) shares hit their highest price ever. With Friday's trading volatility, his wealth is expected to increase even further.

On Thursday, Tesla reported mixed earnings, but the results were encouraging, with investors focusing on several factors including strong margins, earnings per share, net income, and the company's lowest-ever cost per item sold. This was Tesla's first earnings growth in seven quarters.

Much of this growth may also be attributed to Musk's new round of promises.

He predicted that Tesla will start offering carpooling in at least two states next year (California and Texas), where he plans to get approval from “fully unsupervised” Fully Self-Driving (FSD) regulators. Musk also revealed his “best guess” for 2025 deliveries, which he said will increase by 20 to 30 percent, as Tesla plans to start selling more affordable models in early 2024. Tesla plans to sell more than 1.81 million electric vehicles in 2024.

In an earnings call with analysts, Musk said, “I predict Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world, and probably by a long shot.”

Musk controls nearly 13 percent of Tesla's outstanding shares, but could buy more at a steep discount if his compensation plan is approved by the courts. He also owns a majority stake in SpaceX, which he leads, as well as artificial intelligence startup xAI and social media platform X (META) (formerly Twitter).

Tesla's gains on Thursday boosted Musk's net worth to about $270 billion, up $33.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The index is updated at the close of the New York market. The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires Index is expected to grow by $26 billion on Thursday to about $269 billion. Musk's net worth increased by another $3 billion to nearly $273 billion as of Friday, Forbes reported.

The second-richest person on the list is Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) founder and Musk ally Larry Ellison, with a net worth of $213.8 billion, according to Forbes. He was followed by Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with $207.7 billion and $200.5 billion, respectively.

Tesla shares were up more than 2 percent in regular trading Friday morning at about $266 a share, up 55 percent in the past six months. The stock is up just 6 percent so far this year."

As you can guess this strategy has not worked well this month and my YTD profit from my favorite EV company is now down to $40k (see second pic)

But please indulge my big brain boast about not completely fucking it up because in an alternate universe, I would have completely wiped my portfolio. Instead, I had the audacity to do something unheard of in this sub: RisK MiTigAtiOn.

Basically at the height of my profits I transferred most of my money out of my margin trading account and into another cash trading account (and into basic bitch ETFs). This saved my ass because I would definitely would have gone full regard and shorted TSLA with a position 3x larger than what I actually did = 3x larger loss.

So for you fellow degens who have mooned recently, congrats, fuck you, and consider implementing measures to curb your degeneracy. Lock your gains into ETFs, change your account from margin to cash, or transfer your assets to your wife or to her boyfriend since it’ll eventually go to him anyway.

2024-11-09 09:38:10,NEXEL33,TSLA Potential Bearish Next Week,"Next week look at potential bearish TSLA crash

Tesla’s recent price action suggest a possibility of a pullback, potentially to the $307 level, before moving up to the $335 range. Analysts have noted that Tesla’s RSI is over 80, placing it in an “overbought” category, which often leads to a temporary pullback as investors take profits. Additionally, technical indicators show that the stock may face resistance near $335, suggesting it may first need to “cool off” with a slight dip before any attempt at higher levels.

If Tesla does pull back to around $307, it could serve as a consolidation phase, allowing the stock to gather momentum for a push upward. However, this movement is contingent on overall market conditions and investor sentiment staying supportive. Some sources view this pullback as a healthy correction within Tesla’s ongoing uptrend, while others suggest that breaking below $307 could trigger further declines.

In summary, a pullback to around $307 is likely, but it should be monitored closely, as further decline would indicate potential support level testing around $288. 

While it’s difficult to predict Tesla’s exact movements over the next week, there is some consensus among analysts that the stock could face further volatility.

The price is currently above $320, with analysts having varying opinions about where it could go in the near future. Some predict a potential pullback to the $220–$250 range, particularly considering concerns about profitability and broader market conditions. Other more optimistic forecasts suggest that Tesla could eventually see a rebound, with some price targets as high as $350, but this would be contingent on Tesla maintaining strong market position and positive news, such as advancements in their self-driving tech.

Given these mixed views, while a pullback to around $230–$240 is possible, it is equally plausible that the stock might stabilize around the $300 mark or rise, depending on the broader market trends and company performance.

Market hype is dying down after this past week, people are taking out profits and we are looking at a big potential dip in the stock. Overvaluation and Tesla having a bad year so far if we talk sales and production; the uptrend is most likely over and if you haven’t already this could be a good time to sell. The risk is way too high for minimal profit margins.

(It all depends on how much Elon Musk will post on Twitter/X lol)

So, I wanted to bet on Tesla mooning as a result of Trump winning due to their new close relationship, and the deregulation that was coming for Tesla in the new administration. I'm not a political person, just trading off an idea!

So here's what I did:  
  
Bought $15,000 on 3:1 Kamala bets to win $30,000 to hedge my $50,000 in TSLA weekly calls. If she had won, I'd lose $10K-15K Max. If Trump won, this happens... Rolled my weekly calls to 29 Nov/ 20 Dec and held till today. Closed 95%."

Exited everything today for peace of mind and a good night's rest. Rolled the profits into Tesla shares targeting $400. It’s been a brutal yet humbling ride and now ready for the next chapter.

Here’s to those who hold the line for the moon 🚀💎🤲

2024-11-11 18:21:48,Unusual-Stress3401,This is the stupidest shit I’ve ever seen wtf.,Everyday I add to my short positions just to get rinsed thankfully started out small. You guys want me to lyk when I go long?
2024-11-12 22:47:20,Rigor_Morpheus,TSLA: GUH,This is actually a bug when you have positions and go check a watchlist option but still scared me when I checked today 🤣. 
2024-11-13 08:57:23,DoNotPassLine,I ded it agan,"Hello brother degens. Well essentially I got here by disregarding every basic financial/common sense safeguard and went all in daily/weekly n/otms on any slight daily sell off. I wouldn’t recommend it at all but honestly it’s none of my damn business what you do. Everyone around me is irritated that a guy making $20/hr two years ago just made a qm in 3 months and who can blame them. Stay the course. Worst thing you can do is work with some cool mf at your local Wendys plotting your next rise to glory.

Bought $RKLB calls each dip $3.50-$15 
40k $13.5 - $16 $RKLB weeklies for ER
$TSLA and $BITX flips on the side

Started with an all in at $3.5c and walked with my conviction and tuned out the noise. If you asked my honest opinion, $RKLB is just getting started. I’ve been around for $AMD $TSLA $NVDA and it’s showing promising signs and an exciting future. 

Closed ER play and bought $25c and will continue to pound options and shares as opportunities present themselves. 

Congratulations to the $RKLB bulls that just launched out of the deep dark trenches 🚀"
2024-11-14 17:49:00,twitgod69,Coping with Loss in the Time of 🥭 (TSLA and LUNR),"https://preview.redd.it/tk91sh5tpy0e1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d713d5097c8d7742ca6f7974c18810f0daa0fade

I'm typically a very risk averse investor. I made one risky play in 2021, lost 50% of my principal, and swore off short swing investing entirely. Since then, I have parked most of my money in ETFs and a few long-play individual stocks.

With the recent election, a few of my long plays paid off to the tune of 10k and I got greedy and moved back to the HOOD. I made an additional 15% at first, but then the FOMO hit and I tried to chase TSLA and LUNR back to back, losing 25% of my gains in the process. This made me go full paperhands and liquidate.

I come to you degenerates to ask a simple question: how do you cope with this sort of loss? Luckily, I'm not forced to move to the local BK dumpster due to this move, but it just feels so bad. I went from pay for my holidays to losing two months of rent in a few swipes.

You apes have any guidance?"
