‚Äî **Pre-Market Summary** ‚Äî

Two headlines grabbed my attention yesterday:

# [Gold price hits record high on new fears for the economy](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/27/investing/gold-price-record-high/index.html)

# [Dollar index slides to 2-year low](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-index-slides-to-2-year-low-2020-07-27)

I can't help but suspect this is a zeitgeist moment; will these serve as a weathervane for what's to come?

S&P futures and European stocks slumped as market optimism faded during the busiest week of earnings season while Gold was hammered moments after the December future hit an all time high of $2000 following a record-breaking rally, with spot gold tanking more than $30 in minutes and silver dropping as much as 2% before regaining composure.

Gold hit a record high on Tuesday before the sheer scale of its gains drew a burst of profit-taking, with the volatility prompting the Shanghai Gold Exchange to issue a notice on risk prevention and express a willingness to take action if required. The dump in gold also helped the dollar rebound from two-year lows.

After rising almost $40 higher at one point to reach $1,980 an ounce, gold was hit by a wave of selling which it pushed back to $1,915 in volatile trade. Gold is still up over $125 in little more than a week as investors bet the Federal Reserve will reaffirm its accommodating policies at its meeting this week, and perhaps signal a tolerance for higher inflation in the long run.

""Fed officials have made clear that they will be making their forward guidance more dovish and outcome-based soon,"" wrote analysts at TD Securities. ‚ÄúThe chairman is likely to continue the process of prepping markets for changes when he speaks at his press conference.‚Äù One shift could be to average inflation targeting, which would see the Fed aim to push inflation above its 2% target to make up for years of under-shooting.

‚Äî **Trade Of The Day** ‚Äî

The game of musical chairs continues with large-cap tech stocks; eventually the music will stop playing and no seats will be found before prices drop, but until that event occurs, most of the market gains are coming from this sector.

Today's Trade of the Day comes via NVDA who does not report earnings until August 13th. [It's set up in a flag formation with a lot of potential energy, ready to break](https://i.imgur.com/QCgwuCk.png). And as we've seen lately, stocks are breaking BEFORE their earnings date.

Here are two potential plays:

1. What makes trading NVDA a challenge, like every other big-cap tech stock, is the price of $415/share. If you don't define a stop loss, then buying just ONE share at $415 represents the maximum 2% account risk for a $21k account! This is where fractional shares can come to the rescue for small accounts. I can define a fixed dollar amount in RH (or other brokers supporting fractional shares) and they will create a fractional share position equivalent to my investment. For example, if I wanted to create a [$40 NVDA position, then RH would grant me .096 shares of NVDA](https://i.imgur.com/hKtKSEA.png).
2. Alternatively, I could still leverage the gains/losses of a [100-share NVDA position](https://i.imgur.com/QjJHWkf.png) by trading a **vertical options spread using the 28AUG option series**, going **long the $415 call** and simultaneously **selling the $417.5 call** as ""insurance."" This trade *allows me to cap my risk at $125/contract*, which would represent a max 2% risk to a $6250 account.

NVDA had a very profitable Q3 with revenue up 22% from $3.8 billion to $4.7 billion. Their operating expenses were down 4% from $1.6 billion to $1.5 billion. Seeing as though they did not have successful net income in the second quarter, they were up 115%. This can be attributable to the release of the GeForce RTX 3090, the latest graphics processing unit (GPU) for gamers and crypto miners. Consistently sold out in stores, Nvidia's new product helped their net income, rising to $1.3 billion in the quarter. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bouzb3asbj61.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=775ea092e4cf3494fbf5c26cbb19a6764f9f4ea8

Cash and cash equivalents from the beginning of the year to October have decreased slightly by $7 million. Otherwise, current assets have increased about $1 billion from January 26, 2020 to the Q3 Report. Total assets gained about $10 billion as we see Nvidia investing more into Goodwill from $600 million to $4 billion. Intangible assets shot up through $2 billion from $49 million. We can theorize this as research and development, helping Nvidia maintain an edge over other processor companies.

On the liability side, Nvidia has increased total liabilities from $1.7 billion to $2.6 billion. We mainly see this increase due to an increase in long-term debt of $5.9 billion from $1.9 billion. There is some minimal short-term debt, but hopefully will be decreased or erased after Q4 Earnings Report.

**Data Related Revenue:**

Third quarter revenue increased 8% to $1.9 billion from $1.748 billion. Lots of new products including  [NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD Solution for Enterprise](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-ready-made-nvidia-dgx-superpods-offered-by-global-network-of-certified-partners) and  [NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-introduces-new-family-of-bluefield-dpus-to-bring-breakthrough-networking-storage-and-security-performance-to-every-data-center). Nvidia announced partnerships with VMWare, Amazon Web Services, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Data has been a main focus for Nvidia and as they continue to release new products, we expect to see their revenue grow and technological developments multiply with faster, more efficient technology. 

**Gaming Related Revenue:**

Revenue was up to $2.27 billion with a 37% increase for the quarter. GeForce RTX GPUs were at the forefront of the gaming revenue, offering up to 2x the performance of first generation RTX. Ray tracing was also big in the quarter with video games including Fornite, Cyberpunk 2077, Call of Duty Black Ops, and Watch Dogs: Legion all supporting these elevated graphics. 

**Professional Visualization Revenue:**

Relating to 3D graphics and video game design, revenue was up 16 percent to $236 million. 

**Automotive Revenue:**

Revenue was $125 million and we expect Automotive Revenue to increase rapidly as more companies look to implement AI into their vehicles. Partnering with Mercedes, Hyundai, and Li Auto, Nvidia is working to provide AI products to these companies. NIO is also partnering to produce automated cars with Nvidia by 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k9eynpuesbj61.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=e15820f5ac8f3019402fd1d0ccb24a9a5a76f91d

Relating to revenue by market NVDA is involved in. We see major growth in Data Center revenue, similar to our financial analysis. Gaming is still the major source of revenue. We hope to see an increase in Auto revenue as NVDA has partnered with multiple automakers to develop AI driving.

**Q4 Outlook:** 

As stated in their Q3 Earnings Report, they expect to generate about $4.8 billion in revenue. Operating expenses will slightly increase similar to Q2 results around $1.64 billion.

**Personal Opinion:** 

We expect Gaming Revenue to continue to be the majority source but believe Automotive Revenue will increase as development in AI technology continues rising. Nvidia is a strong company in the semiconductor market and is looking to fortify their control with acquisitions including Arm Limited from SoftBank. Nvidia has missed expectations on the past 6 Earnings Reports. We estimate that analysts are bullish on the earnings and NVDA will continue missing on their earnings. This is a long term hold as Nvidia has already proved themselves as a semiconductor company, they now have to maintain an edge against the competition. Their GPU development is required for consistent revenue and we expect involving themselves in crypto mining with the announcement of the NVIDIA CMP HX will be successful."

2021-09-26 19:17:05,CJT2013,Part 4: After 4 Years Day Trading; 2 Years Full Time. Here's Some More Advice," 

Every 180 days I make another post to [thread it back to the original](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/fw82ow/after_2_years_of_daytrading_7_months_full_time/) before it's archived. I do this to prevent a bunch of small posts every few days about trivial subjects.

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/fw82ow/after_2_years_of_daytrading_7_months_full_time/) (Same link as 'thread it back to the original.)

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/j3zlqi/my_1_year_anniversary_of_full_time_day_trading_3/)

[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/mh0nfp/part_3_my_full_time_trading_career_1_year_since_i/)

**This is Part 4,** and I'll go over life outside of trading. The previous 3 talked mostly about trading and the outline of my style is written in them. If you're just scrolling and want to know what it managing money when you're income is completely trading. Then so be it. Mind you this is my experience as a single, male, mid-20's, no debt (anymore), minimalist, full-time trader living in Texas.

**TL;DR** \- Full time trading has its pros and cons. The pros are obvious. The cons are what people don't talk about. The true cost of doing this as your source of income has the propensity to invite an extraordinary amount of stress. Trading is easy (very easy), it's the lifestyle that's not for the faint of heart because bills add up... And trading isn't gambling because statistics and risk management.

Here's what I'll go over in this post:

1. **The real cost of being full time** \- *The main one I want to tackle because like I've said in the past, ""Risk management as a trader is 24/7."" I touched up on this in Part 1 but I really want to break every single expense down and compare it to profits. Think about cost of living and what you're really giving up for this career such as health benefits, matching 401k, easy work, a consistent paycheck, and \*job security\*. This one will also answer the, ""****How much do I need to do this business full time?****"" Question.* ***It depends on your expenses.***
2. **Psychology** \- *Briefly. It's a simple subject/debate. Quick paragraph because that's really all there is to ""Psychology of trading""*

I thought about writing this in a, **""Letter to myself 2 years ago""** to potentially allow readers to read it vicariously like a letter to yourself written from yourself 2 years in the future but perhaps another time as a random post down the line.

There was consideration doing an **AMA** but [read The Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/wiki/getting-started-daytrading) if you want my patterns. *(I'm a mod here, I wouldn't mod a subreddit that suggests bad material. Everything to start you out is there. It's fantastic info)*. There's also a few videos on my Twitter from last year.

**Before I begin:** Trading unfortunately has the propensity to attract gamblers. The entry barrier is so low you could start trading against the pros off a few apps on your phone. Allow that to digest before putting any risk out there. Yes, most lose. But redo that statistic with ONLY people that have a proven business plan backed by statistics then redact those who didn't follow the plan. If you have that with clear cut granular rules.. Fear is the only thing that will stop you from making this a healthy and respectable source of income. I would bet that the success rate would go north of 80%.

***So we begin:***

1) The Real Cost of Trading Full Time:

**A)** I assume you know exactly what your expenses are *but for the sake of granularity.. let's tackle the meat of everyday people:*

* **Mortgage (PITI) / Rent**
* **Taxes on your house Home/Renters Insurance**
* **Health Insurance -**
* **Car Note (P&I only)**
* **Car Insurance**
* **Car Preventative Maintenance (Oil, Transmission Fluid, Servicing, Registration/Inspection)**
* **Gas**
* **Utilities**
* **Wifi**
* **CellPhone Bill**
* **Groceries**
* **And don't dare forget about your retirement or kid's 529 savings plan. Just because you trade stocks doesn't mean you don't need to invest. I do it. And yes it feels weird shorting NVDA for a day trade when that's my heaviest allocation since 2018.**
* (We'll get to the biggest bamboozlement of them all in a while...Income taxes)

Now add some ancillary things in there like: Gym membership, haircut, night out with S/O, gifts for family and friends birthdays, Christmas/Hanukah gifts, and other services but we'll just calculate the necessities then play around with the numbers a bit:

For visuals: [https://imgur.com/a/2LMW8QI](https://imgur.com/a/2LMW8QI)

&#x200B;

These are absolute necessities not including ancillary expenses for homeowners. Of course if you're renting by yourself, with friends, or living at home, adjust for yourself. This isn't including the income taxes you'll pay at the end of the year.

**So the grand total monthly expenses based on averages I found on Google based off of NerdWallet... $5,253. (Google it if you want. The article is from April 29th, 2021). Some consider savings and retirement to not be expenses but I'm not writing this to grasp at straws over trivial debates. This argument is, ""There's money that cannot be spent.. it's an expense to yourself"".**

I'll take that number from above and round it to $5,000. That's way above mine given have the Texas Blue Title to my truck *(Chevy Runs Deep)*, rent my home, don't have health insurance.. [Got some controversial replies on that one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/ou2iws/full_time_traders_what_do_you_do_for_insurance/h70o062?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) but hey, that's my risk. God Blessed me and I don't take it for granted.

So I'll tell you my monthly expenses although I feel its a little intrusive but I'm sure nobody I personally know reads my posts anyways. Just under $4,000/mo are my expenses for my necessities. Mind you... Single, Texas, Male, Minimalist, I loathe spending money, and I can have fun seeing if I can do more pushups than I did yesterday and throwing the baseball with my neighbor at the fields.

Let's compare on a monthly basis. (When I say life of a trader isn't luxurious rather it is, ""Comfortable"", I mean it whole-heartedly.)

**AVG Monthly Expenses (USA)**

[https://imgur.com/a/sPnQMcX](https://imgur.com/a/sPnQMcX)

**AVG Monthly Expenses (Me)**

[https://imgur.com/a/1FeQhUi](https://imgur.com/a/1FeQhUi)

Average American Monthly Expenses. Of course this all varies from state to state. This could potentially be biased since I'm from Texas but it seemed decent to me. \*\*\*\*GRAND TOTAL:\*\*\*\* $5,085.

Now we're starting to see the cutbacks I made to make a living from trading myself... No health insurance, I don't drive anything crazy, no matching in my retirement plan from my 9-5, I barely drive anywhere, cheap liability (don't give me a ticket) car insurance. \*\*\*\*GRAND TOTAL:\*\*\*\* $3,550 of necessities.

Here's the psychology of all those numbers from above...

I assume you know [what an R is](https://www.thebalance.com/risk-to-reward-ratio-1031350)...

So let's take the $5,000 number from earlier. Your monthly expenses that is. And we're talking theoretical backtesting. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*NOT INCLUDING SLIPPAGE OR COMMISSIONS.\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

1. **At $500 risk.** You would need to make 10R per month **(EASY)** *(0.38R/day Avg. OR 1.9R/week)*
2. **At $400 risk.** You would need to make 12.5R per month **(EASY)** *(0.59R/day Avg. OR 2.97R/week)*
3. **At $250 risk.** You would need to make 20R per month **(Doable. Not guaranteed)** *(0.95R/day Avg. OR 4.76R/week)*
4. **At $100 risk.** You would need to make 50R per month **(Not happening)** This is the risk amount I did when I resigned from my 9-5. Mind you I did personal training on the side.

**I can make 10R in a month easily. It's happened in a day before**. [But can you also handle potentially losing $500? Or being up 1.8R then having the trade come back and stopping you out?](https://twitter.com/CJT2013/status/1366742864055664641) I can with $500 risk. Could I do that in 2019? **Absolutely not**. I'd have a blood pressure so high due to materializing my trades with what COULD happen and what bills that COULD have been paid as soon as the trade filled. Now in 2021? I do it almost everyday when my edge is shown but that's with years of statistics backing me. Have a look at my spreadsheet stats. I've had the same EV, Sharpe Ratio, Win Rate, key metrics, etc. for years.

<spreadsheet stats>: [https://imgur.com/a/6AFzQVV](https://imgur.com/a/6AFzQVV)

This is what helps my ""Psychology"" and ""Headspace"" going into trades. This isn't something that can just be handed to you. It's years (months for some) of filling everything out then slicing and dicing data to make it work. ""It"" being your style of trading. It may not be the most profitable but it's something that you can manage mentally. It's years of, ""Why did I take that trade? What was I thinking? I don't want to even fill it out. I won't do it again."" Fill out every trade and things will distill down into a strategy that's YOURS.

I've built these over the years and they tell me the biggest run ups and drawdowns in a theoretical trading account. I know there will be months I make 5R after slippage and some months I make 35R... There will be days I'm up $2,750 in 5 minutes and other days I'm down $1,750 in less than 10 minutes... **There are ALSO DAYS that turn into WEEKS that I don't even touch an order ticket to put on a trade because you don't make money putting on trades. You make money in this business by putting large sums of calculated risk on high EV trades.**

&#x200B;

Visualize your data. It helps make things seem more real resulting in you honoring your business plan. If you're a man of your word, prove it by following your rules from your mouth.

I've gone over how to handle losses before. It's simple, it's an expense just like Mark Douglas says.

**Let's drop the pessimistic scarcity mindset and forget how you handle losses. How do you handle profits?**

Are you responsible with them? There's this thing called, **""Reversion to the mean"".** And we can utter the words, ""Oh yeah I know there will be losses and good weeks"" But do you sulk over 2 measly trades that ALMOST hit target but stopped you out? Do these 2 or 5 or 10 trades change how you trade forever? It shouldn't but I see it on here all the time people pouting over such a small sample size of trades looking for advice. You do realize there will be times you get smacked around then the market goes quiet for a few weeks leaving you making zero deals for a while from time to time. Do you really care about those 2R or 5R or is it the money that was attached to it? That's the loss side of things. The profiting side of things is different. People start to get cocky. I make more R than my theoretical testing occasionally because of missing trades (rarely). Does that mean I'm better than my backtesting? (You'll never beat your backtesting. It's impossible UNLESS you just so happen ""miss"" every losing trade your backtesting would have picked up).

With your extra profits/good weeks do you increase risk and or buy things you don't need? *""I made $2,750 this week. I'll cover your golf game/buy your lunch"" <--Don't be this guy. (Not speaking from experience either srs)*

‚Ä¢There will be weeks you make 13R

‚Ä¢There will be weeks you lose 5R

‚Ä¢There will be weeks you reach your limit down R

‚Ä¢There will be times after you hit your limit down that there are no deals/trades to be made for WEEKS. Plural. Not just 1 week. Sometimes 2 and rarely 3 weeks. Almost an entire month of no trades.

‚Ä¢There will be times where it seems like the market is handing you free money left and right to where you start to feel bad for people on the other side of your trades.

Trading isn't a rose garden of free money, it will feel like that from time to time. It will also feel like an absolute money pit. But Central Limit Theorem / The Law of Large Numbers does its magic:

Actual vs Theory Performance & Growth-

[https://imgur.com/a/Px4PGaT](https://imgur.com/a/Px4PGaT)

People have the propensity to look at their performance through a microscope rather than taking a step back to look at the big picture. That's why it amazes me how people use such a small sample size of data (20 - 100 trades) then put large sums of risk on it. Only to pout about later INEVITABLE results. They complain over 2 trades. You will have tough weeks. Businesses do go through hard times and times of euphoria. Think of how people who rent beach houses in the winter vs summer.

The above picture is looking at the big picture. So let's zoom in to the first 5 months:

[https://imgur.com/a/EHILbyq](https://imgur.com/a/EHILbyq)

&#x200B;

How are you reacting when, ""The market is beating my performance. I'd have done better if I just put my money in the market or sold CC's. I'm only up $19,000 in 5 months when I should be up more than $30,000. I broke rules. I took more risk than I should have. I'll stop while I'm ahead"". How do you react in the other 23 hours in the day after trades result in losses day after day?

This is the magic/beauty of Central Limit Theorem / The Law of Large Numbers:

[https://imgur.com/a/HYO51fu](https://imgur.com/a/HYO51fu)

[https://imgur.com/a/GD1j79L](https://imgur.com/a/GD1j79L)

I always say only 2 things can happen in a trade (hence its so EASY). Profit or loss. Heads or tails. This image is of 10 trials with 2 results. Think of the 10 trials like the 10 different times you start trading you strategy live. You might start with a hot streak or a streak of donations to Wall Street. Think of the 2 results as profit or loss. IN THE END. It all averages out, don't be pathetic and pout over 2 or 10 trades resulting in a less than desirable sum

**So how do YOU decide how much you want to risk? Is it...**

1. How much you want to make in a month divided by an R per month goal? NO.. The market doesn't know you. You can't force R's to happen. They come to you. There are entire 5 trading day weeks that I don't touch an order ticket. It's not everyday you make a deal.
2. How much you think you can mentally handle? Not the best idea but it's a better idea.
3. A cocktail of metrics such as how much buying power you have, Risk of Ruin, EV, and Sharpe Ratio. *(Notice how I don't care for Win-Rate? Win-Rate only tells/asks you 1 thing, ""Can you handle being right or wrong this percentage of the time?"")*

If I had to make a rule of thumb for somebody who wants to decide if they are ready to trade full time. It would have to be reverse engineered:

**You need to find what your EV is and I'll show an example from a micro sample size of 10**

You really do require a large sum of data. I mean it when I say, ""1,000 trades minimum or a full year of backtesting"" (Full year because the market does shift but in the end does not effect a day trader's performance... in MY experience in the long run). Those who get a random 20 or 50 or even 100 and think they're ready to go up against professionals who have electricity bills higher than your yearly income because their computers are running algos and statistics 24/7...you'll learn fast.

[https://imgur.com/a/ivfOxTo](https://imgur.com/a/ivfOxTo):

6 trades that resulted in +2R. 4 trades that resulted in -1R. Average of all = 0.8.. ""Expected"" is just how statisticians say, ""Average"". What this is saying is you can EXPECT 80¬¢ for every dollar you risk on the amount of trades you're testing. This is why when I lose a trade OR profit on a trade. I don't think, ""Wow I made $958 after slippage."" or ""Wow I lost $582 after slippage"". When I see my edge, I think to myself, ""Ok there's <EV> right there. I see income on every trade if it gets filled. Losing trades don't bother me. I have contingency plans... And don't ever say, ""I won that trade"". Businesses that sell <something> don't say, ""Oh cool we won"". You don't ""Win"" when you're assuming a risk. Trading isn't a game that you play.

**2) Find how many trades on average you have. Let's say weeks 1-4. You have 20 trades on the first week, 1 on the second week, 0 on the third week, and 7 on the last week. (I'm using a micro-size sample here again. You really need A LOT more)**

[https://imgur.com/a/PWYSqsH](https://imgur.com/a/PWYSqsH)

I can EXPECT 7 trades per week (ETW). IF I can expect 7 trades per week and each trade will result in 80¬¢ for every dollar I risk... Is this enough to cover my expenses AND TAXES SO THE GOVERNMENT CAN WASTE IT ON CRAP THAT DOESN'T HELP THE PEOPLE WHO PAY THEM.. and a little more so I can have a life outside of home. 7 trades per week \* $100 risk \* 0.8 per trade = Gross Income of $560

Maybe $560 (before taxes) is enough for you to survive. I don't know you or your personal finances, that's your business. For most.. it's not. So let's increase it to $250. For the sake of simplicity we know 250 √∑ 100 = 2.5. So $560 \* 2.5 = $1,400 EXPECTED (not guaranteed) per week.. GROSS income. You'll have to determine how much you need to set aside for taxes when you have that year of data that tells you what you can EXPECT to make that year. This seems more like it... I like this.

**3) Does your account size and margin parameters allow for this?:**

&#x200B;

Let's say you have $37,500 in your account that has 4:1 leverage which allows for $150,000 in DayTrading Buying Power...and you're risking $250 a trade... Risk √∑ StopSize = Shares/Contracts to buy --> Shares to buy \* Price = Capital

**Now let's visualize the data:**

[https://imgur.com/a/FFEsLK3](https://imgur.com/a/FFEsLK3)

The 2nd position wouldn't have been able to be made. If you're running into buying power issues in your backtesting, either reduce your risk or find what's causing this. Perhaps it's the type of style you're trading or a certain pattern that has an inclination to exhaust buying power due to tight StopSizes (Tight StopSizes incur lots of slippage).

Now most would say, ""Oh well I'll run into that if that ever happens. It's only 1 trade"". That's 100% wrong. Your goal is to be 100% efficient and copy your backtesting to a T. Trust me, it will happen, you will miss trades due to complacency when you haven't made a trade in over a week and you're a little rusty. So again in conclusion to the buying power metric, adjust accordingly.

4) Risk of Ruin. Is it under 1%?

This is all discretionary. Me personally I want my RoR to be south of 0.25% but I've read many places that 1% is good. Probably just people repeating what everyone else says but that's just my opinion. How do you calculate it? There's a bunch of ways. [There](https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-calculators/risk-of-ruin-calculator) are a bunch of [different websites](https://2ndskiesforex.com/risk-of-ruin-calculator/) that do a pretty good job that tell it all for you. But if you want it for your spreadsheets so you can visualize it and see how it matures over time:

[RoR formula.](https://imgur.com/a/95P9gy7)

So there it is! In conclusion. You take how much you need. Find your EV, see how many trades on average you get per day, week, month, quarter, etc., then see what's stopping you then assume that calculated risk by seeing what the odds of you failing are. That's the meat of it at least. There are a bunch others such as:

‚Ä¢**Can you take that many trades and not miss any?** (It isn't smart to be firing off 30 trades a day. I know there are those who do it but like I've written before.. decision fatigue gets real. There's also a bunch of different ways to trade so I digress. Billions of dollars are exchanged between hands on NVDA on a daily basis. I might see 1 small edge on a 1' chart on 1 day out of the last 21 trading day month. Everyone sees fit trades all over the charts)

‚Ä¢**Do you have an SOP for how you'll identify and enter your trades based on statistics?** For example I only allow for 10% of my R to be slipped on the entry because on average I get slipped on my stop outs 0.07R. So a losing trade could lose me 1.17R meanwhile the profiting trades achieve 1.9-1.99R depending on how bad I was filled according to my order tickets parameters.

Take what info you got from your research and just pull the trigger. The market is liquid. A $50,000 position shouldn't faze you if you sized your position accordingly and set your StopLoss. Trading is a business. Take the leap if you're considering it. Just remember all the things you forfeit being independent from the normal job life. The market isn't going anywhere so you do have time and the time will never feel right.

2) Psychology - ( 2 paragraphs is really all it is)

Although I can summarize that subject in 4-5 sentences: ""Read a few trading books. Put the ideas on a spreadsheet and see the results. Now trust it, write a business plan, follow it, and trade it live if you like the backtest results."" How much psychology does one need when:

1. Price is Up or Down
2. P/L is Green or Red
3. Result is Profit or Loss
4. A ticker is Showing Edge or No Edge
5. It's Heads or Tails.

**But here's the answer to your psychology of trading questions... You are crippling yourself when you trade money you CANNOT AFFORD to lose.** You're uncomfortable risking money you can't afford to lose and now want some tumblr quote to help you sleep better at night. We all become Steve Cohen/Paul Tudor Jones when it says, ""Simulated Paper Trading"" or when the screen has an orange trim around the perimeter. Trade live when you're risking money you couldn't care less about... Because that's how it should be.... *But make sure you can respect it at the same time <- That's an important one (srs). Anybody can hit dingers in a batting cage, shoot 3's at an LA Fitness, or hit their 5iron 200+ yards at a driving range.. but when it becomes real, people fold.* Done with that subject but I'm sure in 48 hours there will be a psychology post. If you want to improve this subreddit, just reply to those questions, ""Trade with money you can afford to lose and not lose sleep over"".

**All done. So I'll leave it with this:**

Think of my timeline from my first day as a full time trader. September 2019.

‚Ä¢That drawdown I had just 1 month in. No more cushion 9-5 income, no benefits, and the drawdowns happen. Just have a safety net and a StopLoss to start looking for a job if your account/savings go below a predetermined number.

‚Ä¢When you've got politicians proposing a 0.2% Financial Transaction Tax on all stock trades. Doesn't sound like much to the average Joe but it would have destroyed any trading business. [Take this trade](https://twitter.com/CJT2013/status/1339254005223071746) for example if that FTT was put into effect:

**DISH** \- $33.30/share by 800 shares = $26,500 trade IN and \~$26,500 OUT | $53,000 moved.

**TDOC** \- $186.00/share by 158 shares = $30,000 trade IN and \~$30,000 OUT | $60,000 moved.

**SQ** \- $223.25/share by 220 shares = $49,000 trade IN and \~$49,000 OUT | $98,000 moved.

That was a net slippage day meaning I hit break even losing 2R on 2 trades and gained 2R on 1 trade.. 0R but slippage caused me to lose roughly $100.. Now add that FTT... $211,000 \* 0.002 = $422 with a 0.2% FTT. Politicians would have ended this business for me and I love what trading life has afforded me.. time.

‚Ä¢When March 2020 happened and the world shut down (Which put me in a position to start this thread). I couldn't train in a gym anymore for extra cash. There goes a source of income for me. I learned fast needless to say. You never know what's going to happen tomorrow. Me personally I leave it to God because it's in His hands. That's what helps take off the edge for me so whatever works for you, let it do its thing. There's lots of uncertainty in this business (as with any business) so either take the leap or not, just do it right. Following a written plan and honoring it day after day feels like a marathon but you learn to trust it.

Until March 2022! *(I've got some more time in this business for me.)*

**The Strategy: Gap & Go for Biotech Stocks**

I decided not to reinvent the wheel and just took the highly popularized Gap & Go strategy. The ‚ÄúGap & Go‚Äù is looking for stocks gap up from the previous day's close price with the goal to follow an uptrend. I‚Äôm using biotech stocks as they tend to have higher volatility compared to other industries.

&#x200B;

[An example of the ideal setup the strategy is looking for](https://preview.redd.it/ll6javdnk8e81.png?width=3342&format=png&auto=webp&s=657ecf972c32299849d0a97d370f6f05afe29c26)

**Screening Criteria**

* Biotech Equities (I‚Äôm using iShares Biotechnology ETF $IBB as a list)
* Up in the morning 3% or more
* Are above pre-market high and yesterday‚Äôs high

**Enter Criteria** (when to open a position)

* Stock price is above EMA 9
* Stock is going up and EMA 9 is going

**Exit Criteria**(when to close a position)

* Price crosses below EMA 9 and stays there for 3 bars
* End of the same day
* Trailing stop loss of 1.0%

**Conditions**

* $10,000 trading capital
* Do not trade early close days
* Only one trade per day
* If no equities meet the screening or entry criteria, do not trade

**The Results: +58% gain over one year**

Profit **$5,801.4 |** Wins **48 |** Losses **49**

Looks pretty decent but I think that‚Äôs just the beginning as I‚Äôm going to improve it even further by maybe looking at overall market conditions like $SPY behavior or news.

&#x200B;

Overall I feel the market (spy) is running into to big daily obstacles (200 MA) and based on prior days price action, looks like it could possibly be rejecting. On spy itself I did not see a ""easy"" short setup though even with this happening. This led me to move over to other high volume stocks and choosing NVDA as I feel the RR and overall thesis are solid enough to put risk on.

&#x200B;

NVDA (Short)

\- 183.25 is the area where I believe if broken and pushed back into (retested), we will have room down to 180.5 (the cover area) 

&#x200B;

Some factors in this trade that made me choose nvda over stocks like AAPL our its relativity to the market. AAPL has been on a absolute tear and has shown relative strength with the market, which is why currently I will not want to jump in front of that train. This compared to NVDA which has been relatively weak compared to the market, so if the market can breakdown, nvda will have no issue following."

 The stock was on my pre-market watch list. The market started falling and so did NVDA, my plan was to enter the stock short as soon as it reaches the $163.3 resistance level and take a target at $159.5 which is the area of yesterday's daily low.

Entry point - $162.29

Stop Loss - $163.65 (above the daily high)

Add - $160.52

Take profit point - $159.7

In my opinion, excellent trade with proper risk management and pushing forward as soon as I had confirmation that the movement of the stock and the market are in a downward direction, sticking to my trading plan.

2023-01-25 07:47:29,cambridge_probs,Overview of Nvidia's (NVDA) market action,"Overview of Nvidia's (NVDA) market action:

* NVDA just reached its highest peak since last August. W shape with the later U less deep than the first one. This seems to reflect to a pre earnings call hike, we have seen similar movement in the likes of NFLX and MSFT.

https://preview.redd.it/pvhlivdn77ea1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35a5b57bc1a7a9e4d9edb24c160a79ec7e2439a8

* NVDA momentum has crossed the 80th percentile, generally this would indicate that the momentum will tend to go down, either because the stock slows its growth or starts to drop down in price.

https://preview.redd.it/4jy2us6q77ea1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1d154b7d2d5cdd71e078fb0d183ade210030784

* Volatility for NVDA is also above the 80th percentile, in fact it is the highest volatility rate we have seen in the last half year. This further consolidates the idea that the rate of price increase might be reaching its top, because the volatility will tend to drop below the 61% level.

* The options market for NVDA expiring on Jan 27 is showing a bias towards PUTS over CALLS which generally indicates a bearish disposition from the market. We can also see that in the last 2 days the total open interest across all strikes doubled, so a lot of speculation going around.

https://preview.redd.it/jgy6102s77ea1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3adf91eb37c510ae5361d631b692f71cb0eece0

* NVDA seems to be a building up a resistance level at strike $200. With 9.5K contracts open at this level, we can expect a tug of war with MMs.

* NVDA is also showing a definite support line at strike $180. 10K open contracts supporting this level. The next support afterwards would be $170.

* Only 230K units of NVDA are being used to hedge strike $200. If we see an increase in build up at this level then we could envision that if NVDA doesn't reach $200 by Friday then most of those contracts will be closed and the market makers will wind down those hedged position, depressing the price.

# Trading is an Uncertain Business

I had some thoughts recently about **uncertainty** and how it causes a lot of the psychological issues in trading. I believe that not knowing what will happen next often leads to the **fear and anxiety** that we experience in front of the screens. Here's a little blurb I'd like to share with the trading community. 

# Rock-Solid Mentality

Here are two ways to counter uncertain outcomes in trading. First, **know your setups like the back of your hand.** When you trade the same looking charts day-in and day-out, there are less decisions to make. Each pattern has a **STOP**, an **ENTRY**, and a **TARGET**. I abbreviate this as the **S.E.T. Trading Method**. Have a game plan before going into each trade. Be as mechanical as possible. This reduces the mental fatigue of '*winging it on the fly*'.

# Why I Prefer Trading the Same Setups Everyday

Because I **rather be a specialist than a jack of all trades.** After 10,000+ of screen time, I have confidence in my two basic setups. They have proven themselves to me and put food on the table‚Äî**I trust the trend.**

When a trend has been established, **pullbacks and breakouts are high-odds plays**. Price is already moving in one direction and waiting for you to hop onboard. The real challenge is having the patience/discipline to find an entry on the chart which resembles a pre-defined pattern. Your job is to locate a stop, an entry, and then **execute.**

*I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.*     **-Bruce Lee**

Rather than trying to trade the same instrument/tickers every day, I scan for stocks that are forming patterns familiar to me. These momentary opportunities rarely present themselves during the random meandering of the market. But when they do appear, the probability of price continuing in one direction is substantially higher. As a trader, that is my life-line. It is when you put on risk: **I accept the possibility of losing capital in return for a chance of returning multiples of that loss.**

*All you need is one pattern to make a living.*     **-Linda Raschke**

# A Trader is First and Foremost a Risk Manager

The second fact you should accept is that no matter how perfect a setup looks, you can still get stopped out. **This is why I am adamant about honoring your stops.** Sure, bag-holding or averaging down can save you more often than not. But it's only a matter of time before that one trade catches you with your pants down. You will regret even waking up that morning. It's just not worth the potential heartache and pain.

Take the stop and get back in if there's a reason to. Move onto something else if the chart that tagged you is no longer behaving as expected.

# Have Faith

I can accept being wrong half the time because I know that when I am right, my winners are paying me 2x-5x compared to my losers. **A loss is just part of the process of capturing the next winner.** Getting stopped out should not make you feel upset or vengeful. The only time to get emotional after a loser is if you took an impulse trade. And how do we reduce the frequency of that happening? See the first point: **know your setups like the back of your hand and trust that they make money in the long-run.**

# Time is an Arbitrary Unit of Measure

Don't measure performance based on individual trades, days, or even weeks. **Focus on the forest rather than the trees.** With a valid edge, your winners will add up and negate your losers over a large enough sample size. That fact alone should give you the confidence to help overcome some of the uncertainty that is inherent in trading. **Individual outcomes do not matter in the long run.**

The only factors in your control before and during the trade are:

* Valid setup? **‚úÖ**
* Good entry? **‚úÖ**
* Stop valid? **‚úÖ**
* Target feasible? **‚úÖ**

There isn't much else you can do except **let the trade play out.** Win or lose, your focus should shift to **finding the next trade.**"

2023-05-24 16:05:16,DaddyDersch,"The daily abandoned baby‚Ä¶ 5-24-23 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ and VIX Daily Market Analysis (bonus NVDA earnings)","Well going into today I actually found myself to be fairly bullish and I truly expected a bounce and for us to close much higher than we closed yesterday. However, that clearly did not happen and clearly was wrong to be a bull up here. 

Looking at SPY and QQQ daily here it would appear that I was a day early‚Ä¶ With SPY and QQQ closing out there abandoned baby daily bullish reversal candles honestly the temptation to swing calls is insanely high‚Ä¶ However, I actually back tested my swing trades dating back to early 2022 and I actually am net negative on swings alone‚Ä¶ so as much as they are enticing‚Ä¶ not worth it to me. 

Now for those of you that don‚Äôt know what the abandoned baby pattern is‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a rarity and doesn‚Äôt always play out but when it does it usually results in a pretty massive move up‚Ä¶ May 4th is the best example of that daily pattern. 

**NVDA EARNINGS**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gn01elyt1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c89ee80487a8a1fd6bfc0c9f4dc44ea8d6568dc

There is literally nothing else that I can describe this market right now then ‚ÄúWOW.‚Äù I Just can not imagine the fact that a company with a PE near 200 can rally almost 27% on earnings and be near the ATHs‚Ä¶ that truly is mindboggling. 

This market reminds me a lot of the spring of 2021‚Ä¶ 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tnyymngu1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=334a572f5fb98f01fa409fe75b8c80420eb894c8

Now from a supply and demand stand point we didn‚Äôt do anything different today. The most intriguing thing is the fact that we actually gapped under the 413.05 supply. So generally speaking to have a previous supply taken out you must close a new supply over it and then you must touch that level with price action‚Ä¶ a gap down completely changes that metric. So for now that 413.05 level remains on the books. 

We did come down and test 410.2 demand (Support) and hold that nicely today. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema for the first time since May 4th. 

Honestly, I can no help but notice the similarities of todays candle to May 4ths daily candle. If that is the case we likely could see a green open tomorrow and green day tomorrow. This would give us an opportunity to turn 411.16 into a new higher demand. 

However, IF bears can continue this momentum lower then more likely than not our target is daily demand (support) at 404.32/ 405.12. The daily DMI has officially reset to over sold but has not started its wave up. So we are in the early stages of finding the next bottom‚Ä¶. However, keep in mind that the DMI can remain oversold for a period of time before it retraces. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bbx71kzu1v1b1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=a769bacbc200cc5b6453c5d15566bda548042be1

On the Daily we clearly broke through support of the red and black rising wedge. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema. However, we once again are finding support at the daily 50ema. 

We will keep an eye on this blue bear channel with resistance at 415.2 for tomorrow. In all honestly it appears that I was just one day too early on the bull rally‚Ä¶ with NVDA this very well is the dip buy opportunity before we push hard to the 420-430 area again. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 413 -> 418.8  
 Demand- 410.2 -> 405.1  
 Support- 411.1 -> 410.2 -> 408.9  
 Resistance- 412.5 -> 414.1 -> 417.1

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Futures came down and took out that 4149 supply that they had fell just short of yesterday. With this log wicked doji I do expect some upside tomorrow. However, the one interesting thing here is that right now this new daily candle has still not tried to put a new demand (support) in‚Ä¶ DMI remainds oversold though so favor would be a short term bounce coming soon. 

If we get a green day and green bounce on futures tomorrow with a closure over 4165 then we should try to turn 4145 into a new demand (Support). 

However, if we fall through 4127 demand tomorrow then our target would be 4075 demand. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hyscznuv1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=972ad094e65d7ad18af600fb82a8292b68b270d4

Same story here on futes is that we did push a daily candle through the red and black daily rising wedge and now we find ourselves looking at this blue resistance line and that 4159 will be a major resistance to watch that futures actually is hard rejecting after hours here. 

If this is a back test and rejection of the daily 8ema on futures this could be a very bearish movement with the ultimate target being 4095 support. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4055 -> 4208  
 Demand- 4128 -> 4075  
 Support- 4125 -> 4110 -> 4095   
 Resistance- 4159 -> 4171 -> 4190 -> 4208

**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vkeybwbw1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=25ad3f32780e3d684a2403c7e06a279e63a7935a

QQQ did close the same bullish abandoned baby pattern here as SPY‚Ä¶ QQQ missed its intraday gap fill by about 9 cents. 

The daily 20ema will sit just over that 326.82 supply tomorrow and if the bears can continue to sell the markets off (which will be very hard to see QQQ drop with NVDA up 28%) then we should target that 326.82 supply. Looking here you can see we have a major demand (support) are at 325/326 and that should be a big area where we could bounce If we do see a continuation sell off. 

However, if we get a green day tomorrow we likely will see the DMI wave back up with a new demand being established at 331.32. This would lead QQQ to target 336.37 demand. I actually will look to take some longer 14-30dte calls on QQQ if we do see that play out tomorrow. 

QQQ Daily Levels  
 Supply- 337.6 -> 326.82 -> 322.31  
 Demand- 336.37 -> 325.99 -> 34.99

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xi6lnxsw1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2fbdaaa680f8133a1e1ffd62801bf582787f782

One reason I am also particularly bullish is the fact that the VIX attempted to break out over that critical 20.08 level and rejected. This rejection is a near perfect double top off the May 4th VIX candle which is when SPY put its bottom in‚Ä¶ 

If the VIX retraces tomorrow and closes under 20.08 again then I would feel far more confident that we are going to see a bigger upside move on SPY‚Ä¶

The next major upside level for the VIX is 21.36 and downside level is 18.86. 

**DAILY TRADING LOG**

Honestly this was a terrible trading day just from a day trading stand point‚Ä¶ 0dte premiums were so juiced because of Yellen and FOMC minutes and we had really such little overall movement that plays just weren‚Äôt paying out very well‚Ä¶ I really did okay trading intraday and my day trades were green by my swing calls were obviously red and that gave me a good sized hole. 

Still working on a nice week of gains here but definitely not my best day of trading."

I'm currently in the journey to learn how to be a profitable scalper. After close to a year into my journey, I've decided to purely focus on a basketball of stocks (e.g., AAPL,TSLA, NVDA).  I've heard about traders being profitable by just trading one ticker and I'd like to find out if this is possible. 

As practice, I've been eyeballing them for everyday for awhile now and just getting used to how they move. 

I'd like to (if at all possible) focus on these stocks and be very familiar with their price action , idiosyncrasies and characteristics. My focus is to only focus on the first hour.

Problem is, I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking for and it's probably too soon for me understand the nuances of each of these stocks.

Do these stocks react at certain levels? Do they act a certain way during a time of the day? Are they sensitive to movements of the SPY or QQQ?

  
Any pros out there care to provide some guidance on this? Or is this a futile endeavour?

2023-12-19 05:38:45,TearRepresentative56,I'm a professional trader and this is some of my notes on what's been happening in premarket.,"Note: I tried to take on some of the feedback from yesterdays post and provide a bit more analysis, although I keep some more back for my personal notes. Hopefully you can find value in this post though.

**What happened yesterday, and thoughts on this:**

* Yesterday, SPX and Nasdaq made marginally new highs, whilst Dow was flat. This despite fed officials continuing to try to walk back rate cut optimism.
* This move higher in SPX and Nasdaq was driven by Mag7 again, with exception of Apple and Tesla. We can see the mag7 dominance by the fact that QQQ rose by 0.43%, whilst QQQEqualweight was down for much of the day.
* Oil was higher on Red Sea disruption, particularly after BP said they would not be using the Red Sea Routes after Houthi attacks. This forces them through the Suez Canal which delays oil shipments by 2 weeks on average.
* Steel stocks pumped after Nippon Steel agree deal for X, although Senator Fetterman says he intends to try to stop the deal.
* Solar stocks notable losers as Sunpower raises doubts over its ability to continue as going concern, which dragged other Solar stocks lower.
* Vix remained suppressed around 12 which is supporting the market higher.

**My Thoughts:**

* Personally seeing signs that the market is topped out. Saw Tesla reached resistance near 260 but got rejected. NVDA now trading at 500, which I think is a psychological level that sellers will be sitting at, so would expect it to get rejected there over next few days. Apple trading near 200, which I think will be a psychological level sellers will be at. To be honest, I would have expected Apple to be down more than 0.85% with news of Apple Watch sales being paused and China accelerating their Apple ban in government institutions.
* Snapchat got a very bullish analyst upgrade but was flat on the day, which can be a sign madcaps are topping out too after a very bullish run.
* Nasdaq (IXIC, not NDX) now coming close to 15k which will see sellers sitting there.
* Other than lack of headwinds in the market in coming days in terms of data, I think market is close to key resistance levels.

**TODAY‚ÄôS DATA LEDE/MACRO EVENTS:BOJ RATES DECISION - recall from previous reddit post, my expectation was for BOJ to hold rates despite speculation of possible hike.**

* Made no change to negative interest rate, holding benchmark at -0.1%Yield curve control unchanged.
* People had speculated that they would tighten which pumped up yen. Yen to now retrace those gains.
* BOJ spoke of ‚Äúextremely high uncertainties‚Äù and said more needs to be seen to determine if ‚Äúpositive wage inflation cycle is in place‚Äù.
* Seeing gradual improvement in inflation but still not in a position to be sufficiently confident.
* Didn‚Äôt remove the rhetoric about ‚Äúwon‚Äôt hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary‚Äù. Thats quite dovish

**ANALYSIS:**BEFORE SPECULATION THAT BOJ WOULD TIGHTEN, USDJPY WAS TRADING AT 147.22JXY was trading at 68.Probably needs to retrace close to back to this.As Yen falls, Japanese equities going to become cheaper, so Nikkei will likely pump for few days now.

&#x200B;

**AUSTRALIA RBA MINUTES - For meeting where RBA went back to pausing after hiking again last month.**

* Board considered whether to raise rates by 25 bps or to keep steady. Decided on pause.
* Will continue to analyse the data to determine future policy.
* Some encouraging signs on inflation that need to continue.

**ANALYSIS**:Not much to these comments to be honest. Continued data driven rhetoric.**US** 

**BUILDING PERMITS AND HOUSING STARTS DATA COMING.**

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî FX ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* Yen lower, propping up USDJPY. USDJPY was trading at 147 before speculation of tightening. Since that didn‚Äôt materialise, USDJPY needs to retrace.
* Money rotating out of yen into other currencies like AUD, GBP etc
* Note Risk reversal on dollar index has touched lowest since 2020, and options pointing to substantial drop in USD. This would support equity markets.
* Note: Dollar and US equities are most inversely correlated since May - Can watch for some correction there.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî OPTIONS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* 4800 remains sticky strike
* Record Call skew - Bullish.
* Single Digit implied Vol
* CTAs moving supporting on Brent Crude now - algorithmic strategies supporting oil

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî MARKETS OVERVIEW ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* Markets: Flat as you would expect in premarket when they are trading at all time highs and there‚Äôs little macro catalysts to drive them notably higher right now.
* NIKKEI: Japanese stocks pumping after ultra easy monetary policy maintained for foreseeable future. Makes yen lower and Japanese equities cheaper
* GER40:Majority of sectors slightly green.
* HKG50: NOTE: I‚Äôm holding positions in the HKG50. I think it‚Äôs undervalued and people will rotate from US equities into HKG at some point.
* OIL: Flat this morning after pushing yday, although it did pare those gains when US said they will help to safeguard Red Sea vessels. Launched a task force. This reduces risk premium and made oil fall again.Yields: Flat, slightly lower

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* PIMCO SAYS THEY THINK UK WONT ACHIEVE SOFT LANDING. Said they are betting against GBP. Said UK consumers feeling brunt of interest rates more than US as less on 30 year fixed mortgages.
* MS‚Äôs MIKE WILSON SAYS US EQUITIES HAVE GREEN LIGHT TO MOVE HIGHER. - Another Bear capitulates. To be honest, I see this as a sign of market topping out too.
* GOLDMAN releases paper saying UST yields are higher in short term, but near historical averages. Bullsh\*t report really. They‚Äôre high, lets be real. Highest since 2005.
* GOLDMAN‚Äôs SENTIMENT INDICATOR TICKED UP TO 1.1. Points to stretched equity positioning. Due a correction.

HEICO:Will read during the day. Is too pumped up right now and I was hoping for a correction aftermarket. Didn‚Äôt come so not an immediate priority to read before market open. Wont be buying it at these prices.I just read a short overview with summary that aerospace product demand was strong, and acquisitions helped to fuel their growth. Without acquisitions, still 12% organic sales growth though. So strong performance.

&#x200B;"
2023-12-20 05:31:43,TearRepresentative56,20/12 I'm a professional trader and these are some of my notes from premarket.,"**I want to start this post by clarifying some of my comments in yesterdays post, and responding to some of the user comments there.**

* When I said the market looks like it can be topping out, I am in no way saying I am a bear, nor am I saying I am short on the market. This is the US stock market. Obviously, in the long run, it is ultimately going to go up, and break highs. To clarify, I am still long the market. What I was saying was that barring a catalyst, which it doesn‚Äôt appear there is in the near term, I do not see a sharp move higher. I am not saying the market cannot move 0.4% higher etc day to day. It can, especially when there is nothing on the economic calendar in way of headwinds. The market is moving on optimism and can continue to move in the direction it is, especially when VIX is so suppressed. What I am saying is that if you look at the economic calendar, there‚Äôs not much this side of the new year to help push it higher forcefully.Instead, when you look at certain factors which I will break down here, it seems likely there will be some short term correction, before it again moves higher.Firstly, Mag 7 trading near resistance, which it will have to break. E.g. NVDA rejected at 500. AAPL rejected at 200. Obviously a news story can break these resistances, but trading right against them, makes it more likely for them to come down than go up.Same can be said for indices, with SPX just below all time highs, which will probably act as a resistance.
* Secondly, look at market breadth. More than 90% of stocks are trading above their 50 day Moving average. This makes sense to be honest, when you consider the rate cut optimism. But at the same time, if you look at the last 3 instances that this has happened, in each of them, the market has done short term corrections. The last time that it was able to reach a level where market breadth was at 90% and still move higher was in 2021. To be honest, I do not see enough similarities in the economic picture today to in 2021 to suggest this will happen again now. Interest rates are much higher, economic growth is slowing, consumer is holding up but there‚Äôs still uncertainty as to how long it can.
* For this reason, I see it as more likely than not that there will be short term correction before it moves higher again.
* I am still long the market. We operate a long only fund, so we never short. What we do do, is fluctuate our cash position to reflect the headwinds and tailwinds in the market, or you can say, the risk/reward in the market. Right now, I have trimmed my positions, and have closed my swing trades/active trades. I still have my passive positions all running. To this end, if the market moves higher for whatever reason, and I am proved wrong, I am happy, because my passive positions are doing well. If it price corrects, I am also happy as I can put my swing trades back in and utilise my cash position. This is what trading is all about in our strategy, using the cash position to hedge ourselves such that we benefit if the market goes up, or comes down.
* *I will now continue with the normal posts:*

**What happened yesterday, and some of my trades from yesterday:**

* Was off the desk yesterday, due to family bereavement.
* From what I can see, market continued to push higher from open. SPX is now 0.6% below all time high, whilst DJI and Nasdaq closed at all time high.Dollar was lower, whilst bond yields were flat.
* Only order I placed was for a small day trade in ARRY, entering at 18, for 2.6% gain, after its rating was cut by analyst.
* My sell order on short term trade in AVAV also executed at 130.

&#x200B;

* ***Because I was off the desk yesterday specifically, I will insert a section here on general market conditions, for those who want a bit of a summary, those who don‚Äôt can skip.***
* Market breadth continues to increase. The QQQ Equal weight, which negates the heavy weighting of the Mag 7, has moved from 52 week low to 52 week high across last month and a half.40% of stocks on the S&P are now above 70 RSI
* Goldman Sachs custom indices of unprofitable and heavily shorted stocks up 12% in last week, which tells you people are short covering and continuing to move into those stocks which have potential to run up with rate cuts.
* Discretionary stocks now at their highest level of outperformance vs Staples since January 2022.
* Put interest still very low, traders are chasing not hedging.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî EARNINGS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* FEDEX earnings: Was trading at 52 week highs going into the print, up around 20% from last earnings, which puts pressure on the earnings being good.
* EPS of 3.99 missed estimates by 5%Revenue of 22.2b was down 3% yoy, and missed estimates by 1%Express Revenue still not picked up in last 4 quarters.
* Continues to see less shipments. Package volume down YOY. Perhaps less benefit from the UPS strikes than expected. Bit disappointing.Continuing on efficiency and cost reduction program (DRIVE). Cost reductions of $1.8bTo this end, cost per packaging declined 2%, due to lower line haul expense, and better last mile productivity.Demand remains uncertainBuybacks on stock of $1b in FY 2024
* Guidance:Cut full year revenue guidance - to fall single digit %, vs previous outlook of flatEPS guidance fell short at 17.75 at midpoint, miss consensus by 3%
* Conclusion:Yes margins expanded on lower revenues to help bottom line, but operating margin still fell short of expectations. Package volume decline showed limited benefit from UPS strikesNot enough has improved at all to justify how high it is trading.
* Overall, 5/10. Not terrible, but not good enough vs where its trading. Actually cut full year guidance, vs last quarter, when stock price is 20% higher.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî DATA LEDE ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* **JAPANESE BALANCE OF TRADE DATA -** Imports fell more than expected, whilst exports were more or less flat.
* This in theory should prop up the Yen as less imports means less selling of JPY. Seems to align with when Yen started going up last night, although the move is partly price correction from yesterday‚Äôs drop.
* **UK CPI (Nov) -** As noted in my Sunday post, I expected it to come in soft in line with US, and other European peers. GBP to fall slightly.
* This proved correct, as it came in well below expectations at 3.9% vs 4.4% expected.Core also fell to 5.1% vs 5.6% expected. Lowest core reading and headline reading in more than 2 years.
* MOM move was deflationary.
* This result is good for UK economy. Whilst Bailey at last meeting was signalling higher for longer, and UK and US situations are different, this datapoint shows that UK are starting to catch US up on inflation fighting front. May see rate cuts sooner than expected in UK.GBP falls on this, as it signals BOE can maybe move more dovish than before.
* **US - Consumer Confidence (Dec)** \- After market open, so hold early trading in anticipation of this.
* **US - 20 year bond auction**. Can move bond yields which can influence markets. Likely will see decent demand which will keep bond yields lower.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî FOREX ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* GBP moves lower on soft inflation numbers, which suggests BOE may be able to be more dovish than first thought.
* Yen doing some price correction after yesterday‚Äôs move lower. Also moving higher as Japan plans to issue more government bonds in 2024, increased demand for Yen.EUR lower slightly, in sentiment with GBP
* Note: Am holding GBPUSD as I believe that the BOE will hold rates higher than the Fed. Today‚Äôs inflation surprise does bring that into question a bit, but still think BOE will be more hawkish than Fed. I had trimmed a tiny bit ahead of the inflation print, so will put that back in soon.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî MARKETS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* DJI hit new all time highs in premarket again, near 37,600 then pared gain as European markets sold off after open.
* SPX and NASDAQ similar story. Mostly flat in premarket. We expect this to continue, as barely any news catalysts around, VIX is suppressed, and GEX is very high which tells us volatility will be lower.
* GERMAN market quite flat, rejected at 16,800 today.
* UK at 3 month high following inflation data which fuelled rate cut bets.
* NIKKEI higher again on dovish BOJ yesterday as they signal ultra easy monetary to continue
* HKG50 opened higher, around 16,750 then sold off the gains, down 0.77%
* Oil moving higher by 1% in premarket. Continues higher on Red Sea complications. According to the downtrend I have drawn, which I think it will eventually break to the upside, oil is now close to the top of the downtrend, and may on a technical analysis basis do some correction here. My near term price target for oil overall is 80 though.
* Bond yields slightly lower in premarket today, which can support equities. But it‚Äôs only marginally lower so likely to have no impact.  10y lowest since July

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî OPTIONS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* GEX continues to grow - which lowers volatility4800 still sticky strike. 0dte tells us this is likely to be the max range today.HVL at 4645, 2.3% below spot.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* Didn‚Äôt read too much as was off the desk yesterday. Here‚Äôs what I did read.
* DataTrek review 30 day rolling correlations of Daily returns on SPX vs individual large cap sectors, to suggest that the current rally has around 1-2 weeks left to run. They suggested that past that, market optimism would have pushed too far too fast.
* Bank of America‚Äôs fund manger survey yesterday showed equities saw largest inflow since October 2022. Tech saw the biggest inflows, industrials saw the biggest outflows. Dont; take too much notice of this inflows/outflows news. Ultimately, Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 9 straight days of gains.
* Bank of America also put out a piece saying that although credit card delinquencies have risen sharply over the last year, households on average remain flush with liquid assets. This is something we knew as Black Friday sales showed increase in Buy now pay later.
* Societe Generale: Market finds it easier to price monetary policy impact (rate cuts) than impact of inflation trends on margins. Last year, they misplaced hikes, vs impact of inflation on profits. For 2024, could be the other way around. AKA they are saying markets are probably pricing too much cuts.
* Unicredit - ‚ÄúCurrent enthusiasm seems somewhat exaggerated from short term perspective, and setback is highly likely‚Äù. Positives are priced in.

**‚Äî‚ÄîMAG 7 NEWS ( CAN MOVE MARKETS) ‚Äî‚Äî**

&#x200B;"
2023-12-21 05:45:30,TearRepresentative56,I'm a professional (news driven) trader and these are some of my notes from premarket,"  
**What happened yesterday, and my thoughts:**  


* Yesterday, we saw the market start to do a little correction. There wasn‚Äôt much news behind the move, except for the fact that VIX options expired, and QQQ failed to break the Call resistance 0DTE at 410. This may have contributed as VIX options had been suppressing VIX till now, and the expiration reset the options positioning a little. As such, VIX moved higher rapidly from 12.5 to 14. For the most part though, this was just normal mean reversion.   

* Markets have been at all time highs, up 16% on SPX since October lows, with 90% of stocks above their 50 day moving average. The market had just become a little too stretched, and needed to breathe. 
* Note that this is of course a very small correction in the scale of the move the market has just done, and is very healthy. Moving indefinitely higher is what‚Äôs not healthy. The market has to absorb and digest that move, before moving higher again. In premarket already, we can see the market already start to pare the drop. Over the next few days we will see volume dry up a little going into the Xmas break, and there isn‚Äôt much on the economic calendar in the way of major catalysts. With lower volume, we may see markets trade flat, or we can see exacerbated moves in either direction. With little on the economic calendar, it‚Äôs hard to guess exactly which way markets will move on a day to day basis. E..g markets are up in premarket, but this can easily fade to retest 4700 at least. On the whole, markets are still stretched despite the 500 point drop on the Dow, but this isn‚Äôt to say that today will be red. I caution against making day to day predictions because people call me up if they are in any way wrong. Look, we as investors aren‚Äôt fortune tellers, especially when there‚Äôs little on the economic calendar to guide us. We can only assess the overall state of the market, to determine risk reward. As readers had noted, I had left my passive positions running (trimmed a bit) and had sold all my active/swing trades, to build cash, because I suspected a near term small correction. I didn‚Äôt put the cash into the market yesterday. The dip happened so close to the close that why would I put it in just before, when I have no idea how markets will open tomorrow, especially with little particularly in premarket in way of economic news? The correction, whilst sudden, was still small. So personally, I am waiting to see more before I put the money I had trimmed, back into the market. If it moves higher form here, which premarket points to (although premarket movement means little), I will still be happy as my passive positions make money.   


**My Trades:**

* (Explaining trades I made in my personal portfolio. People have mentioned rightly not to share too much details about company work, so I have shared trades I was executing in my personal port instead)  

* In terms of what I did yesterday, I explained in yesterday‚Äôs post that oil was trading at the top of the downward channel that had been forming. I thought it could easily get rejected there, so I trimmed half my oil positions, and left half running. My price target on oil is 80, so I left some going to meet that, but knew that this could easily get rejected at the top of that channel, so took some out. Technical analysis suggests it can even move lower to 67 now, although you‚Äôd have to see a move higher in dollar for that to happen.   

* I also trimmed my enphase position because I was off the desk the day before. Note: I still have some running. I also have positions in FSLR and ARRY. I am bullish on solar still for next year. The reason why I sold some was because I was holding form 80. It was up a lot, and whilst interest rate cuts will help them a lot next year, it doesnt immediately change their near term earnings, which were guided last quarter to be terrible. A 62% move higher in quick time was good enough for me to take some profits here. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
**TODAY‚ÄôS DATA LEDE/MACRO EVENTS:**  


* **UK CBI Trades data:**
* One of the less important metrics for the Uk, but does give some telling insight, especially because it was such a miss to the downside. Came out -32 vs forecast of -14. It‚Äôs a leading indicator of retail performance, so signals a weakening retail sector in UK. (Little impact in GBPUSD because it is a small indicator)  

* **US GDP Final Revision (Q3) - Expected to remain above 5%**  
PCE revisions too
* note: these are both revisions, and barring a big surprise, won‚Äôt move markets too much as should be confirming previous readings.   

* **US Jobless Claims**  
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH**  


* Evercore says that they see a big pullback in first half of 2024, as recession ‚Äúmaterialises‚Äù.   

* Goldman put out a piece where they compared the performance of small caps vs large caps in various markets over the last 12 months. There, they concluded that smalls have only outperformed large in emerging markets. Other than it, in Japan, Europe, US and others, they have underperformed large caps. This is something we all mostly knew anyway, since Mag7 led the rally most of the year. I suppose for those that don‚Äôt follow other markets, it‚Äôs interesting to know this was the case in other markets too.   

* Goldman put out another piece looking at average inflation across G10 economies. They estimated that across them, core inflation ran at just 2.2% over past 3 months and 1.3% in November alone.   

* Hedge funds net long positions on crude hit record low going back to 2011.   

* Fitch says they expect their next moves from the Fed, ECB and BOE to be cuts - no sh\*t Sherlock. No more hikes from here.   

* Interesting fact: Statista shows that international tourism finally reaches pre pandemic level.   
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**FOREX**  


* GBP was lower yesterday after soft CPI print and continued slightly lower today. Trading 1.265. Note: I hold position in GBPUSD  

* USDJPY continues doing correction as yen moves higher. This is correction after Yen sell off following BOJ dovishness. Note, can bounce off of 142.59. Then again, can not. Depends on initial jobless claims numbers as they can move the dollar.    

* AUD moving higher again.   
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 

**MARKETS**   


* SPX: Sold off yesterday a bit back to 4700. Held that level in aftermarket, and pared losses to 4722. ( up 0.5% from lows of yesterday)  

* Nasdaq: Fell to 16,550 yesterday, pared some of those losses in premarket, up 0.7% in premarket from the lows.    

* GER40 tracked the sell off in US overnight. Was relatively flat since.   

* HKG: Opened much lower, after US sell off. Recovered 1.6% from there. Basically pushed up right from the open. Partly due to China economic stimulus measure announcements e.g. cutting deposit rate  

* OIL: Failed to break out of downward channel yesterday. Still testing it in premarket. Needs to close above 75 on daily to break out.   

* VIX: pushed up after expiration. Now at 13 handle.   

* Bond yields slightly higher today, probably as sellers take from bonds into equities.

2023-12-25 18:05:24,TearRepresentative56,I'm a professional money manager and this is what I'm watching/ expecting for the week ahead.,"  
**Some Expectations:**

* Low volume during the week due to Holiday season. 
* Nothing really on economic calendar this week at all + low volume = expectation of relatively flat movement.
* No major headwinds so unlikely to see big correction this week, from a fundamental perspective. 
* Next real significant economic development will be the FOMC minutes on 3rd of Jan, and even that will probably send the dollar lower, pushing markets higher.  So not expecting sustained correction in the very near term.
* Likelihood is that any dips will be bought and market will remain around current levels for now.   


**A look at some of the Options data to reinforce these expectations:**  


* EURUSD Skew at highest level of the year. Traders continue to bet that EURUSD will breakout. I personally had 1.10 as a price target on EURUSD but the active 1.11 strike tells us traders want 1.11.   
[https://imgur.com/a/xRK9bWq](https://imgur.com/a/xRK9bWq)    
The lack of data this week and risk reversal on DXY falling, pointing to continued drop in dollar means I won‚Äôt be surprised if 1.11 hits.   

* SPX skew is relatively flat. This tells us traders are not expecting a big move in either direction. Simply due to the fact of so little being on the economic calendar.   
Skew has lowered a bit, due to spike in VIX, but weak dollar means that volatility is not lasting in markets.  
Tells us dips are likely to be bought.  
   
[https://imgur.com/a/LHI1Srn](https://imgur.com/a/LHI1Srn)    

* Slight weakness in DOW Skews vs SPX skews. More hedging activity there. So if there is likely to be any weakness, Dow will probably underperform other indexes.   

* Tesla EXPECTATIONS FROM Skews (just because I know the retail audience Loves Tesla):  
Bullish imbalance tells us sentiment is positive around Tesla. But the bullish skews lowered, so probably see some chop this week. May move higher after Year End.  
[https://imgur.com/a/2DkrGYP](https://imgur.com/a/2DkrGYP)    

* NVDA EXPECTATIONS FROM SKEWS:  
500 Gamma wall seems a strong resistance, unlikely to break in short term.   

* ***Fun fact, is the first time since 1997 that not a single company will report earnings during the last week of the year.***   


  
**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî CALENDAR/ CATALYSTS ‚Äî‚Äî**   
**MONDAY:**  


* The only thing I was watching today was my Yorkshire puddings, to make sure my brother in law didn‚Äôt steal them.   

* Ueda was talking earlier, with key highlights being that he said the prospect of achieving sufficient inflation rate isn‚Äôt enough yet and stressed the uncertainty involved. Said cannot predetermine when to raise policy.   
Most of this is already known to the market, so no real movement in USDJPY   


**TUESDAY: (Boxing Day, so bank holiday for many countries. Expected to see low volume):**  


* US House Price index - Will probably show a MOM change of around 0.8% imo. 
* US 2 year auction - Will probably send 2 year yields lower, with better than expected demand.   


**WEDNESDAY:**  


* JAPAN - BOJ will release their version of the fed minutes, from the meeting where they dovishly held rates stable, against expectations of a hike. My expectation is that this will probably send JPY lower as they reinforce their commitment to ultra easy. USDJPY to prop up  

* US - 5 year auction. Similar expectation to the 2 year auction the day before.   


**THURSDAY**:  


* JAPAN - Retail sales.   

* US - Jobless claims - Expectation for it to come out slightly under forecast, due to Holiday seasonality.   


**FRIDAY:**  


* SPAIN - inflation Rate preliminary reading for December. Significant as Spain CPI tends to be a leading indicator of Eurozone CPI.

2024-01-18 12:03:37,BigBreadBreaka,Where Did I Go Wrong?,I took two shorts today on SPY. One right at open which is not normal for me( should‚Äôve waited for a range or direction to be established) but I was focused on mainly that the higher time frame was pointing towards a bearish sentiment. I was also focused on a bullish dix correlating to a bearish market from my understanding. Then I scaled down onto a lower timeframe and waited for a fair value gap for my entry. Immediately after both trades I got stopped out before reversing down in which I would have hit my targeted take profit. From my understanding I should have maybe waited for a better entry and been more patient but from what I saw there wasn‚Äôt any better entry setups above my targeted entry. So where did I go wrong on this trade?

Puts are the absolute worst way to make money, it is extremely difficult if you don‚Äôt time your puts correctly, I have closed my eyes and randomly bought calls and made profit multiple time. No strategy required just buy calls when SPY or QQQ goes down and it always bounces, works best with 0dte 

I have bought puts at the top overbought levels and it just keeps pumping away, I have never seen SPY goes down and not have a bounce, calls = free money

TLDR fuck put options

Sorry for the angry rant

Edit: Today was a PERFECT example of what I‚Äôm talking about, it was going up with ZERO pullbacks, anywhere you got puts you would get your head taken off unless you timed your puts perfectly and took profits immediately, I‚Äôve never seen SPY goes down the same way without some sort of bounce before going back down even during the 2022 bear market

Valuation disconnected from reality: Some analysts believe that the company's valuation is disconnected from its actual performance, which could be causing the stock to drop

 U.S. export controls: New U.S. export controls on advanced technology to China have led to concerns about the impact on Nvidia's sales and revenue. The company has already completed its scheduled deliveries to China for 2023, but the new restrictions could cause a ""permanent"" loss of opportunities for U.S. businesses in China

 Revenue guidance: Nvidia increased its fourth-quarter revenue guidance to $20 billion, but there was a ""whisper number"" on Wall Street that the company might miss its revenue targets. This slight misstep in revenue guidance, combined with U.S. export controls, could be contributing to the stock's decline

 Insider trading concerns: Some investors have expressed concerns about insider trading activities, which could be affecting the stock's performance"

2024-02-12 06:26:14,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is a complete report of everything I read and analysed from premarket 02/12 to inform your trading today.,"**Analysis**:

* Today looks like a relatively light day in terms of macro releases and news. This is pretty much reflected in how flat premarket has been, around the levels it closed on Friday. 
* Let‚Äôs get into positioning then: 
* &#x200B;
* On SPX, the call interest is surging on SPX at 5050 and 5100, following the break of 5000 on Friday. The market looks like it is extending the bets on the market going higher from here. The images below compare the option positioning on Thursday close vs Friday close. See a lot more developing over 5000.   
 
* [https://imgur.com/a/HiOeIpa](https://imgur.com/a/HiOeIpa)
* This chart shows all expirations. If we look at some near term expirations, we can see that the call resistance has rolled up to 5030. This is a bullish sign. We are not really seeing much activity here on the downside to suggest any worry of an immediate correction. 
* 5030 level looks like it could be a key level today, but watch the levels to watch section below  
  [https://imgur.com/a/XLxpVBl](https://imgur.com/a/XLxpVBl)   
   
 the Gex is very positive right now. We are quite far above the HVL. This tells us that mosts likely, since we are in such positive gamma, the volatility will be suppressed today. 
* Skew is actually pointing slightly lower, but it‚Äôs no big deal, it‚Äôs just because futures are flat. block flows are very strong, and continue to increase. 
* Traders are starting to hedge the market, buying OTM puts, but the positioning still bullish, just increasingly cautious.   
 
* If we look at QQQ then, we had SPX hit 5k on Friday, but the market is still watching to see QQQ hit 440. That is a VERY sticky strike. We see a LOT of call interest on it, and IV OI. I‚Äôd expect it to hit this week, particularly if some of the macro data supports it.  
 
* We can see the positioning in the images below:  
 
* [https://imgur.com/a/LyaRLVJ](https://imgur.com/a/LyaRLVJ)  
 
* Note that QQQ tracks Nasdaq (NDX), which is currently trading at 17,956. Watch 18k level. The market will probably face some resistance there and we will need to see stronger volume for it to break. 18k is also the Call resistance. So whilst you may watch QQQ, you should also be watching this level on NDX. 
* Look at one thing here: mag7 Skew. This is the skew but concentrated on just the Mag 7.
* Moving higher again, at ATH. Traders don‚Äôt expect any issues for the big firms. Expected to carry the market higher. 
* Let‚Äôs take a look at some FX ahead of the week:
* AS mentioned in the report yesterday, ahead of CPI, risk reversal in USD is pointing lower. Traders are not particularly concerned about the CPI and PPI and expect ti to come in soft or in line. 
* We can see this bearish divergence here, clearly. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/prrhrjB](https://imgur.com/a/prrhrjB)
* For individual currency pairs, EURUSD and GBPUSD, for both, risk reversal is pointing higher. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/NZXurdQ](https://imgur.com/a/NZXurdQ)
* A quick look at NVDa then, which is up again in premarket. 
* What we are seeing here is basically a continued squeeze. Skew points higher again, hits a new high. This comes as IV in OTM puts drop. BASically, bears keep trying to predict and short the pullback, but then as it moves higher, they continue to get squeezed and rush to cover their positions. This is moving NVDA higher in a parabolic way. If you are bearish on NVDA, it seems you need to just watch and wait rather than trying to guess the top. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/TiMQA2k](https://imgur.com/a/TiMQA2k) 

**Levels to watch: (plot these on your charting platform as it will help you to analyse intraday price action).**   
 

* SPX currently trading at 5025.
* One key level will be the 0dte Call resistance which is now at 5030. 
* Note the all expiration call resistance remains at 5000, which will create some support there. 
* Other key levels for gamma are 5050 and 5015. 
* My quant says the max trading range for today is 5059.
* I doubt we hit that high, probs get stoped around 5030-5035. Let‚Äôs see
* Quant says minimum of expected trading bound is 4994 ish. 
* QQQ:
* Like I said, watch 18k level on NDX. This translated to around 438.4 on QQQ
* Call resistance for QQQ is 440. I doubt we move higher than that today as there‚Äôs not much news. 
* Key gamma levels to watch are 435 and 437. 
* Quant says min of day trading range will be 433 and max of the day trading range is 441.   
 I think we trade well within that range, as traders don‚Äôt want to make big moves before CPI. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* Nothing particularly significant on the economic calendar for today. No big data releases. 
* We do have some fedspeak later, as Bowman speaks, as does Kashkari. 
* For the UK, Governor Bailey will be speaking. He probably reiterates the data driven approach for BoE and that its too early for cuts. After the last BoE meeting, markets trimmed bets on BOE rate cuts slightly, pricing 107 BPS in 2024, from 111 before.

**INSTIUTITIONAL RESEARCH:**

* An interesting piece here from Goldman Sachs: They have put out a note telling their clients to get out of parabolic tech. Said Everyone Is In The Same Trades And All-In‚Äù. Went ton to say that this is the Best Start Of The Year Ever For Momentum, But ""You Don't Want To Be On The Wrong Side During A Momentum Crash‚Äù.
* A quote from a Goldman Sachs paper, where they compare the state of the stock market today, to the 2000 Dot com bubble: ‚ÄúAt this point, valuations at the top are no where near as frothy as they were at the height of the Dot Com Bubble. The 5 largest stocks traded at 43x Fwd PE in March ‚Äò00, a 59% premium to the Mag 7‚Äôs current multiple of 27x.""  
 
* We see this demonstrated in the table below:
* [https://imgur.com/a/fUdSFMa](https://imgur.com/a/fUdSFMa) 
* Bank of America say that they can see potential for the outperformance of small cap this year. They said that the factors that are supportive of this in 2024, include bottoming profits, historically attractive valuations (29% discount to large), improving market breadth, a Fed cutting cycle and inflecting macro indicators that are correlated with relative performance.
* Global gold outflows continued in January, dragging Gold price lower, shows Bloomberg. 

**MARKETS:**

* SPX: Closed Friday at 5026. In premarket, been trading in such a narrow range. Basically flat. 
* NASDAQ: Trading flat at 17,965. Watch the technical level of 18k today. Market will be trying to break it, may temporarily intraday, but this is the key level to watch as will need significant volume for Nasdaq to close above it. 
* DJI: Flat in premarket at 37,650. 
* GER40: Has been trying to break 17k level. Got a big push at 9am when market opened, right up to the 17k level. 
* Hong Kong Market closed for national holiday. 
* Chinese market slightly higher, trading at 11,430
* OIL: Got rejected at 77 on Friday. Trading slightly lower today, at 76. OIL IS SLIGHTLY LOWER Mostly as price correction from last week, but also AS ISRAEL SAYS IT HAD CONCLUDED A SERIES OF STRIEKS IN SOUTHERN GAZA, somewhat easing concerns of supply risk. Strikes continue in Gaza though, as Gaza officials say airstrikes kill 67. 
* Bonds: Opened higher today, then moved lower.  

**FOREX:**

* JPY higher ahead of PPI later today. Risk reversal on JPY points lower. Traders are expecting that due to a hesitant BOJ to tighten, and no certainty on wage inflation, that JPY will underperform. 
* Dollar more or less stable right now, slightly higher, after got a bit of a push when European market opened. 
* EURUSD slightly lower, came to 1.08 then bounced down as found resistance and no big volume from the macro data to drive it higher. This was all technicals. 
* GBPUSD following lwoer.
* AUDUSD opened slightly lwoer, then moved higher. 
* Not much news driving FX movement this morning. Just usual price action. 
* NZD lower on comments from NZRB governor who said that inflation ate was still too high at 4.7%. Whilst hawkish, there was some repricing, NZD has been up recently on expectations of RBNZ to hike again. 

**MAG 7 NEWs:**

* AMZN - Jeff Bezos has sold $2b worth of Amazon Shares, his first sell since 2021.

At this point, I‚Äôm considering just buying and holding this stock for a few months because I have completely disabled my bots from day trading NVDA.  

My prediction as of today 2/20/2024 is that NVDA will pop tomorrow (especially in the afternoon) and NVDA will absolutely crush analysts estimates tomorrow evening.  I also anticipate them providing an extremely positive guidance/outlook and suspect we will see extreme volatility near and after the closing bell tomorrow.  I‚Äôd also like to see NVDA announce a major acquisition and/or partnership.

Just my .02 as I am not a financial professional.  YMMV"
2024-02-21 06:31:19,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket 02/21,"**ANALYSIS:**

* Firstly, NVDA earnings are today. 
* Bloomberg is showing an 11% predicted volatility on earnings, as shown below. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/C1nuTr6](https://imgur.com/a/C1nuTr6)  
* NVDA is lower in premarket on continued profit taking, but we can notice a few things. Firstly, skew, which was pointing sharply lower has now reversed upwards, as IV in OTM calls increases. 680 was a key gamma level where traders tried to buy the dip from yesterday.   
 As we know earnigns are a risk. Earnigns when the stock is up 50% in the last quarter are an even bigger risk. We saw that in other earnings reports, like Google‚Äôs where good earnings were still punished based on valuation. 
* Bulls on NVDA are for the most part holding their positions.
* This is the net gex profile for NVDA, skewed mostly to calls still on all expirations. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/IlFyzTE](https://imgur.com/a/IlFyzTE) 
* On the 1 week to expirations, we can see more hedging for the earnigns. This clears up and the profile is again biased to calls when you look at monthly expirations. So traders hedge into earnings s that makes sense, but outlook still bullish. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/hzs6fu8](https://imgur.com/a/hzs6fu8) 
* Key levels for NVDA are:
* Call resistance at 700, although lots of calls on 750 too
* Put support is at 640
* Put support from 0dte options is at 650
* These will be key levels going into the earnigns print. 

‚Äî‚Äî

* China points higher today as markets react to the cutting of 5 year rate yesterday. We noted on weekend that it seemed skew for Hong Kong was pointing higher and we could see calls building on 17k. It seems that traders are still expecting 17k to hit. 

A look at Oil:

* Spot price falls at the moment, as volatility continues as traders buy ATM puts to hedge for volatility.
* However, we can see from skew that there is a bullish divergence there on Brent. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/xtjaHfa](https://imgur.com/a/xtjaHfa) 
* Volatility continues due to the hedging and the evercahgning geopolitical landscape, as well as ever changing Fed expectations. 
* But overall, outlook still looks bullish. 

A look at BTC\\

* Looks like we can be seeing a local top here. IV in OTM calls is reducing, block trade flows also reduce. Skew points lower. May see some correction. 

A quick look at indices then:

* Volatility skew does point down as traders hedging with put options, but money flows from hedge funds hit new high yesterday. Funds are buying the dip, and not expecting it to last in medium term. A lot in the short term will depend on NVDA though.

2024-02-21 07:22:13,tradingpoker,Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings play and caution for later.,"The charts below are NVDA 1 minute when earnings were released last time (21st¬†November 2023) As you can see, it's a violent move and a pure gamble if you are in beforehand, IMO.¬† 

The second chart is the NVDA 5-minute chart, on the day of earnings. I am predicting an inside-ish day on NVDA, which could be great for scalpers/day traders.¬† 

I will avoid the earnings release, as that's gambling IMO. But I will look to trade a smaller size once it settles after hours.¬†

Levels-wise, I will be watching the $750 on the upside; after that, we have no levels to look at. Downside $670

2024-03-01 12:34:44,Valuable-Mango5753,Blew my account in less than a week,"As the title says, I managed to burn $4K+ in less than a week.

These losses were mostly due to my poor judgment when it came to earning announcements for certain companies.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what I entered:

Monday- 1 $NVDA 800c (SL on Tuesday at -$1.2k loss)

Tuesday- 8 $SOUN 8C (SL tdy at a -$736 loss)

Tuesday- 4 $BIRK 50C (SL on Wednesday -$550 loss)

Wednesday- 4 $SNOW $250C (SL Thursday at a 1.8k loss)

This has been one of the worst weeks of my life. I‚Äôm hoping that Monday I can recoup some of this loss and recover my account.

2024-03-04 08:25:23,GetEdgeful,üìà $NVDA fills the gap 89% of the time ON THIS WEEKDAY,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew0idst45cmc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d34f82b3f251d6e6698cc6695d269f48cab58362

this report pulls data on $NVDA's gap fill tendencies by weekday for the past year.

what I found was that on Monday's, $NVDA has a strong tendency to fill the gap - regardless of whether the stock gaps up or gaps down.

for the past year, when $NVDA has gapped down (meaning today's opening price was lower than yesterday's opening price) the gap has filled 89% of the time, and when $NVDA has gapped up (meaning today's opening price was higher than yesterday's opening price) the gap has filled 78% of the time.

you can use this to estimate how price action today will move relative to yesterday."
2024-03-06 05:40:37,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing from premarket after market sold off yesterday,"**ANALYSIS:**

* We do have a few volatile events today. Firstly the ADP jobs numbers, which are expected to come in hotter than last month, whilst Powell talks in his testimony infant of Congress. 
* I think Powell‚Äôs talk will be important, but probably not the impact some may fear, as if you look historically at when Powell testifies, not as much movement as other speeches by Powell. Only thing I worry about is the fact that inflation ticked higher last month and could tick higher again this month if you look at Euro inflation reports for Feb as a guide. This could make Powel more hawkish than before. Still, Powell is generally v candid with his words so I‚Äôm not sure he will say anything which kills the market, but let‚Äôs see. 
* Regardless, if we look at risk reversal on DXY, we see it widen as traders continue to expect dollar to fall in medium term.
* Traders are mostly long GBPUSD, and very short USDJPY. LEt‚Äôs see. 
* EURUSD they are long as well, but less so. Let‚Äôs see. Moving towards 1.09 which is trader target but may see rejection there. 
* Regarding price movement yesterday, we saw a squeeze as traders very short volatility, which was triggered by bad news around TESla and AAPl. 
* This moved VIX much higher to 15, which led to QQQ sell off.
* Was. Bigger sell off than I anticipated, but signs of a major pullback still not there.
* Traders still very short vol, and we saw them sell it off towards end of the day, and today, VIX is lwoer at 14. 
* Yesterday was likely a buying opportunity rather than a major negative event. 
* We can get volatility from JOLTS today, they tend to be volatile for the market, but still no major signs of pullback. 
* Institutional money flow on SPY not pulling back one bit. THeyre still long. 
* On oil we can expect a bit more sideways movement below 80, as volatility skew quite flat, but I think fundamentals support move back to 80 on WTI as producers look to extend cuts to supply.

DATA LEDE:

* South Korea Inflation rate comes hot, at 3.1% vs 2.9% expected. Above previous reading of 2.8%
* MOM was hot 0.5% vs 0.4% expected
* Aus GDP (Q4) - Comes stronger than expected, at 1.5% YOY growth rate, vs 1.4% expected. Previous reading was 2.1%
* So it slowed vs last month, but beat expectations. 
* GERMAN exports and imports both beat expectation
* Exports MOM came 6.3% Up, vs expectations of 1.5% increase
* Imports were 3.6% up, vs expectations of 1.8% increase
* This points to improving domestic demand and international demand, although is one data point. 
* Eurozone Retail Sales (Jan)
* Retail sales were down 1% YOY, better than expectations of a -1.3% decline.
* MOM retail sales were more or less in line.
* So still declining YOY. This has been the case for more than a year. Not great, but in line with expectations. 
* ADP Employment Chnge (Feb) - Expected to have grown to 150k jobs placed according to official consensus. 
* POWELL TESTIMONY
* JOLTS (Jan) - has been a volatile one for market reaction for intraday trading, so look out for this one.

2024-03-06 07:18:23,GetEdgeful,NVDA touches its previous week's high 85% OF THE TIME,"&#x200B;

this report shows how often $NVDA has touched its previous week's high and low in the past 3 months. this report only considers the current trading week and the week prior - that's it.

what I found was that 85.71% of the time, NVDA has touched last week's high at some point during the week, and only touched last week's low 21.43% of the time.

based on this, we see that highs most frequently get touched and that price is trending upwards. you can use this to take trades targeting last week's highs."
2024-03-06 15:30:51,TommyGekko,Finally positive after 2 years thanks to NVDA calls,"Pretty huge accomplishment for me, I‚Äôm an 18 year old day trader and I‚Äôve been trading negative for about 2 years and I finally was able to look at my all-time return and see green. Made back all of my losses mainly through NVDA calls in the past few months. I definitely could‚Äôve made much more, but I exited all my positions pretty quickly since I was scared of running my account back down again. I was down $1,400 (44%) at my lowest point in December 2023, and I was able to get back all of my losses which I‚Äôm pretty proud of. It‚Äôs basically pocket change and isn‚Äôt that much of a brag, but just thought it was something neat to share with people."

this report looks at NVDA's price action on Friday's to see how often price broke out, broke down, didn't break or broke both out and down of the opening 15 minute range in the past 6 months.

what I found was that on Friday's during this period, price never broke both out and down of the 15 minute opening range, nor did it ever stay within it. 

based on the data, I found that price tended to break out (meaning price broke above the opening range first) 65.39% of the time, and only broke down (meaning price broke below the opening range first) 34.62% of the time.

you can use this to estimate how price will move on Friday's after market open."

this report looks at NVDA's price action for the past 6 months to see how often gaps up on Mondays fill and how often gaps down on Monday fill.

for context: a gap up is when a stock's opening price is higher than yesterday's closing price and a gap down is when a stock's opening price is lower than yesterday's closing price.

what I found was that for the past 6 months, if a stock has gapped down on a Monday, it has retouched Friday's closing price 75% of the time. 

use this when building your next trading strategy to make sure you're trading with the trend and not against it."

2024-03-20 05:16:32,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket ahead of FOMC meeting today.,"**ANALYSIS:**

* Yesterday, we saw an early dip in the equity markets as SPX touched 5123, and QQQ touched 433.
* However, as mentioned in the premarket report and continually mentioned in my commentaries, traders remain incredibly short volatility. 
* AS such, that created the usual vix crush as we see here, with VIX dropping below 13.
* [https://imgur.com/a/KfchMYf](https://imgur.com/a/KfchMYf) 
* This fuelled market makers to add liquidity, which led to the usual intraday recovery back to 5180 and 438.5. 
* Today, we have the FOMC meeting which will be the key focus, as will the updated dot plot which will be released. 
* We are seeing low volume in options ahead of this, as traders are basically waiting for it. 
* On January and February CPI coming in ahead of expectations, and with Shelter and Core inflation remaining very sticky, there is some likely expectation that Powell will be less dovish. 
* I think that‚Äôs probably true, he will be more hawkish, but it appears traders are not expecting him to be outright hawkish as such. 
* Probably more neutral, pointing to the fact that inflation is coming down, and will affirm their intention to continue bringing inflation down. He will probably continue to say that they just need to see more of the same before moving to cutting. More of the usual data dependence commentary, but with hints that cuts will still be on the table. 
* Credit Default swaps don‚Äôt show any signs of major alarm, and continue to head lower. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/PTPNoBo](https://imgur.com/a/PTPNoBo) 
* Traders are hedging into today‚Äôs meeting. Dollar is increasing in premarket. Nonetheless, traders remain very short volatility still. Inflation swaps are still pricing inflation to come down later in the year, even if it appears that it is stuck for now. 
* I think that off the back of this, we do probably see dollar increase, hence why I haven‚Äôt averaged my positions against USD today and averaged with very little size yesterday. Looking at the equity market, we probably see some volatility, and a dip, but vol will probably crush again, so any VIX spike probably won‚Äôt last long, which should again fuel market makers to add liquidity to aid the recovery (not necessarily same day recovery, but short term nonetheless). 
* On next monthly expiry, we have seen 5300 accumulate gex quite a bit recently, so traders are still looking higher, but hedge for some volatility.
* As mentioned previously, we can see traders open puts inr response to a possible hawkish Powell, and then get squeezed again and forced to short cover, as we have seen repeatedly over the course of this rally, and as we saw on Monday. Shorting probably not the way forward as traders are still bullish on medium expiries. 

**DATA LEDE**

* China maintain their loan prime rate for 1 year and 5 year at current rates
* UK INFLATION
* Core inflation falls to 4.5%, below estimates of 4.6%. Previous reading was 5.1%, where it was stuck for the last 3 months. 
* Headline inflation came 3.4%, below estimates fo 3.5% and down from 4% where it was for last 3 months. 
* Largest downward contributions came from food, restaurants and cafes.
* Biggest upward contributions came form housing and motor fuels. 
* This is an encouraging print, pointing to possible dovish BOE. Following the print, futures now point to 71 bps of BoE cuts by year end, vs 67bps before the print.  
* EIA Crude Stock Data 
* Of course, the main focus of today is the Fed decision, and Powell‚Äôs press conference. 
* Dot plot will be released with the report. Could show we have taken another cut out of there.

2024-03-20 17:29:17,T1m3Wizard,I was told to post my positions here after asking why my margin balance was showing -$46k yesterday. Hopefully someone can help and this can add some insight with this to yesterday's post?,"Here is my [post/question](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1bj0cf3/am_i_overleveraged_my_options_margin_available_is/) from yesterday.

For context,  aside from using this account to occasionally day trade I also use it to short options as well."
2024-03-21 17:16:12,T1m3Wizard,Started trading 5 years ago with 36k after saving up from my first job out of college. These are the lessons I learned along the way (in no particular order) that I hope can benefit other aspiring traders.,"Preface: I only funded this account with the starting capital of 36k and had never added to it. This was supposed to be my go ham with real money live trading account so I can feel the real emotions involved instead of a painless simulated trading experience/practice (probably not recommended). Perhaps I got lucky but I am surprised it survived as well and grew so steadily. This account has evolved from buying and holding to day trading stocks and options, and is currently in the premium selling phase for the last 3.5 years. Methods changed and evolved but the below is true and should remain consistent as you still need to analyze the chart before jumping in.

I decided to do a write up in hopes of helping others because I asked a question the other day since I started using my broker's mobile app and was perplexed about the way it displayed it's margin balance and boy did I get chewed up üòÑ. To be fair there were some helpful comments but it was extremely rare. I don't want others to be discouraged and think this sub is unhelpful to hopefully someone finds these suggestions helpful. Here were my list two posts and the comments I received if you are curious: [Why is my margin balance showing -46k?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1bj0cf3/am_i_overleveraged_my_options_margin_available_is/) / [Positions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1bjtarx/i_was_told_to_post_my_positions_here_after_asking/)

1. Psychology plays a big role.
2. Don't trade with money you can't afford to lose.
3. Trade with the trend.
4. Pick stocks with relative strength or relative weakness.
5. You can measure a stock's RSRW against SPY and/or it's sector.
6. There is a STEEP learning curve.
7. Journal and review your trades.
8. Although Indicators are subjective, if there are enough people watching or using it, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy so always be mindful of where buyers and sellers are eyeing.
9. If a stock is strongly supported or sold off at one area or price point, it will most likely create a temporary top or bottom as buyers/sellers were rewarded there once before so you can expect them to react the same way. 
10. Unless you're yolo'ing or gambling, don't trade around earnings or any major news event as these can create a catalyst and are very unpredictable.
11. Gaps tend to be filled.
12. Day 2 and plus continuation is a real thing if there is a strong enough catalyst (e.g. gap and go)
13. Institutions move markets.
14. Volume is important.
15. Don't chase loses.
16. IV is high for a reason.
17. Know your greeks if are going to trade options.
18. Use a top down approach such as multi time frame analysis  and start with the higher time frames.
19. Buy and hold trumps all (unpopular opinion for day traders but it's true).
20. Try not to trade during the first and last 30 to 60 mins of market open/close. 
21. There are opportunities throughout the day 
22. Know and develop your own trading style and do what works best for you.
23. Risk management is important but I do not follow the regurgitated 1% rule (it's regarded if you have enough buying power and margin at your disposal).
24. Use margin wisely.
25. Learn to adapt to different market conditions.
26. What has worked in the past might now work in the future if macro economics changed.
27. Never stop learning. 
28. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

That's it for now mainly because I'm tired and don't want to type anymore, I'm sure there's more. Will come back later and add to the list perhaps. Good luck everyone!"
2024-03-21 17:29:39,Emotional-Machine354,"For every 10K I put into the market, something down with me... bad analysis? or bad luck?","&#x200B;

Trend First, I brought NVDL(NVDA) at highest sold at loss. I am aware it is week RSI high. but RSI is a relative strength indicator. that just means it is at very high strength stock.....

Then, Ture average value is very important. I look at AAPU(AAPL) . it is under EMA 200, but above ema 20. We all know what comes this morning. I sold at loss again....

and buy TZA before JP goes dove speak......Just because CPI and PPI are hot...

While JP speak, I brought Bitcoin... that is only thing down today....

and brought BABA when XI visit USA......

even there is bull market, I still managed pick at wrong time to buy wrong stock. Can someone point out what should I read or learn?"

2024-03-26 15:51:18,ShittyStockPicker,"For me, learning to trade has been a series of lightbulbs I turn on to get further down a dark hallway, rather than one switch I turn on that lights the whole building. Here's a lightbulb I turned on a couple years ago","I remember this so clearly now. This was the Summer before the infamous October low. We were just off the highs of the June Low of 2022. (The June low of 2022 was also a key moment of my trading career, I'll have to leave that one for a different day.) I could see in the charts that we were primed for a solid run up on $SPY.

  
But still, there was so much to be bearish about. Interest rates were still going up in the Summer of 2022, inflation was still high, gas prices were still outrageous, and we were all still certain we were about to fall into a pit of depression at any moment both emotionally and economically. But still, like an enthusiastic elevator operator the charts were screaming at me ""Going up!"". It was at this point I learned to trust the trust and my ability to listen to what they were telling me. So, in an act of what was faith at the time, I bought the calls. 

Oh, and did we ever go up! It was one of those exciting months where my swing trades just went further in the money and I was constantly rolling them, I was buying every dip in sight on an intraday basis. I rode the wave all the way from about $385 to $410.   


Then I got scared. I started to say ""This isn't rational, we're in a bear market. The shorts have been reset. We have Jackson Hole coming up and JPOW is gonna hammer the market. There's still too much inflation he doesn't want the wealth effect!""  


I sold, right on the verge of making a killing I sold. Had I rolled those calls up one more time I would have had an opportunity to be a much wealthier man. But I sold. I watched SPY march all the way to nearly $430. Wow. I knew it was irrational. I knew it was dumb for the market to do that.   


After some hurting, and after some soreness at not letting my winners run I had what I regard to be one of the most important lightbulb moments in my trading career. Jesse LIvermore once said ""A man has to have experience, and he must pay for it."" Did I ever pay for it! Here's what the experience I paid for: **I'd rather bet on the market doing something more irrational than it already has than bet that the market will come to it's senses.** 

&#x200B;

**Epilogue**  
There was some guy on /r/WallStreetBets who posted about $NVDA being a bubble somewhere around $250. He said something along the lines of ""What, so we're just going to buy this stock all the way up to $500?"" I responded back, ""Why not $500""?"" He sarcastically said, ""How about $750?"" ""I said, why not a $1,000?""   


Only difference between him and I is that he thought I was in on his joke. No. I knew that if there was any stock that was going to do something irrational in 2023 is was NVDA. I was free. Free of thinking about stocks rationally. Free of trying to apply logic and reason to something that is guided by ignorance, fear, greed and hope. I was, in a way, trying to lead him to the place that I'm in now.

2024-03-27 04:46:56,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time news driven trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket 27/03,"**ANALYSIS:**

* Yesterday we saw SPX trading extremely rangebound all day, from 5225 to 5234, until the end of the day, when in the last 45 minutes, we saw 3 big red candlesticks, and SPX suddenly closed at 5203.
* We see that here below:
* [https://imgur.com/a/gsG42U8](https://imgur.com/a/gsG42U8) 
* Now the short of it, is that NVDA sold off from 950 to 925 at the end of the day yesterday, which dragged the market with it. However, that's not really the full explanation. Why did NVDA sell off like that and what was the market mechanism behind it?
* To understand that, let's fully understand what we mean when we talk about skew. Skew tracks the ratio of the IV of Calls to the IV of Puts to give us an indication of trader sentiment. It's a very useful indicator.
* What does it mean when skew is lowering, as we see happening in NVDA over last few days:
* [https://imgur.com/a/i1V6Ghm](https://imgur.com/a/i1V6Ghm) 
* When Skew is lowering, it means that either the IV of calls is decreasing, or the IV in puts is increasing.
* Because IV in calls was reducing in this case, it implied some short term downward pressure as it means that traders are lowering their exposure to the stock. In this case, because IV in call options OTM was lowering, but traders remain short vol, This meant market makers removed liquidity at the end of the day to hedge, once NVDA started dropping. When market makers remove liquidity, thats when we see downward movement.
* This is what accelerated the sell off EOD to being a bit of a flush out.
* Now is it a problem?
* Not really. Traders remain very short vol. We saw vix jump, but it has now since sold off the gains pretty much. Because VIX remained low and is being shorted the shit out of, once it started to drop, market makers bought the dip again, and we see that in premarket we are back to 5225.
* [https://imgur.com/a/OSVWwj6](https://imgur.com/a/OSVWwj6) 
* Regarding NVDA, positioning overall is bullish. But we do see IV in call options continue to lwoer as we see traders selling calls. This we can attribute to profit taking as not seeing massive OTM put gamma.
* Gamma wall at 900 is still the support, and one at 920 before that and 950 has v high Delta on it so that's the wall to break to move higher towards 1000. Target in med term is still 1000 as positioning still bullish but with skew pointing lower towards profit taking we can see bit of volatility in the low 900 range.
* Oil we saw headed lower as skew was pointing lwoer as was the crack spreads, but it holds the 80 level. Staying above 80 WTI is key as it will maintain the bullishness and liquidity. Below this we can see further volatility increase.
* Gold positioning extremely bullish. 
* Markets are still v bullish. Not much signs of stress in the market. Just look at the European markets. GER40 is flying, every day just keeps increasing. This is a clear sign that markets are seeing low stress. 
* Traders continue to be very short volatility. This means that any VIX spikes we do get are likely to be sold off quickly as market makers will increase liquidity. This makes it much more likely for dips to be bought quickly.
* I don‚Äôt see much cause for concern on PCE, yes we can see dollar increase from FX side, but traders in equity market are pricing hotter inflation in near term before it levels out in the longer term. That‚Äôs probably what we will see. 
* Chinese market looks volatile, that‚Äôs the only thing, but has strong support at 16k. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* 01:30 Australia CPI index: Came in line with last month, slightly below the expectations for it to tick up slightly from 3.4% to 3.5%
* Came in at 3.4% YOY
* Spain inflation rate preliminary reading for March:
* YOY at 3.2% in line with expectations, slightly higher than 2.8% last month
* MOM comes slightly hot at 0.8%, vs forecast of 0.6%  
 
* Note core came in lower than expected. 
* This isn‚Äôt really surprising. Forward inflation swaps in US is already pricing in a hot CPI next month for US, so we expect similar in Europe. 
* 10:00 Eurozone Economic Sentiment (Mar)
* Comes in line with expectations at 96.3. Improved economic sentiment vs last month, as hopes of ECB rate cut rise.

this report pulls price action on NVDA for the past 6 months to look at how often price touches the previous week's high, the previous week's low and both the previous week's high and low as well as how often it stays within the range.

what I found was that on average, NVDA has touched its previous week's high 68% of the time and only touched its previous week's low, 32% of the time. 

if you see that price has a tendency to touch last week's high - which in this case it does - you can use this to set targets around that price. 

on the contrary, if you see that price doesn't tend to touch the previous week's low - which is the case here - don't aim to set targets around that price. "

this report pulls price action data on NVDA for the past year to see which weekday the weekly high tends to fall on and which weekday the weekly low tends to fall on. 

what I found was that in the past year, Friday's often record the week's highs (38% of the time), whereas, Monday's generally record the week's lows (33% of the time). 

this might make Monday's a good buying opportunity, aiming to benefit from a rise after the trough.

2024-05-11 12:37:06,Reaver921,"Why do so many people trade highly crowded stocks like AAPL, NVDA, SPY, QQQ etc?","It would seem to me that these type of stocks are highly manipulated by large market movers and also very overcrowded, with very low change ups and downs. They are also highly susceptible to big moves on almost any kind of news which is very common. So why do so many small retail traders choose to specifically trade only these stocks?"
2024-05-14 13:39:36,ImNotSelling,Did any of you guys catch the 2pm up move on spy/es/spx today?,"If so, what was your indication of the move? 

Did you just wait for confirmation of a bull run, or could you tell by the accumulation, or did you get an early tip of tomorow‚Äôs cpi report?"
2024-05-19 14:43:14,saadalvi10,What stocks are you currently trading? Which ones have the most volatility? ,I usually trade NVDA or MSTR. I was wondering what everyone is using for their stock of choice?  
2024-05-20 21:49:01,saadalvi10,"Does anyone exclusively trade large cap stocks? If so, which ones do you most commonly trade? ","I'm curious to know if anyone is profitable by solely trading large caps such as TSLA, NVDA or APPL. "
2024-05-22 05:03:19,TearRepresentative56,"I'm a full time trader and this is my total pre market cheat sheet, including positioning analysis on US markets, NVDA, TSLA and FX. ","ANALYSIS:

Overall US Market:

* SPX Skew is elevated, traders remain bullish. Skew points slightly down, but this is hedging ahead of FOMC. Traders selling some calls but its v low volume.¬†
* Note: positioning and trader sentiment around NVDA remains bullish.¬†
* Because of this positive expectation around NVDA, traders are buying calls on QQQ. Traders expect Nasdaq rot continue to go higher.¬†
* So we do see some disparity there in what traders are doing. They are more bullish on tech right now ahead of NVDA.¬†
* Momentum continues to show stronger buyers, we are at ATH on both QQQ and SPX.¬†
* MSFT and NFLX both hit new highs yesterday.¬†
* VIX liquidity continues to be very low, whilst liquidity in equities is increasing. The fact that VIX liquidity is very low is a sign that traders have no real fear in the market. Bulls v comfortable right now.

On FX & metals:

* As mentioned in other post, GBPUSD positioning bullish, particularly after CPI came hotter than expected. Short term and long term we see skew point up. 1.28 target. on EURUSD, skew points higher but price is stuck below 1.085 for now. 1.08 is clear support, traders target 1.09, even calls on 1.10.
* On Gold and Silver, we can see a slight pullback or flattening whilst traders wait to see more volume. V low volume but mostly traders selling their calls now and buying puts. Still low volumes though so not expecting big moves. But also not seeing big move higher yet.

Key stocks for focus:

* **NVDA: skew is flattish this week but pointing higher. Traders will be looking for 1000 if earnings come in in line. More if stock split. A lot of calls around there. As a result of NVDA earnings looking higher, SMCI higher too. Other semis in general quite bullish on hopeful expectations for NVDA.**
* **TSLA: Got bit of a jump yday as skew pointed higher and we got good news to support. Gamma is mostly between 180-190. Can see move to 190 if NVDA supports, but beyond that not much OTM call gamma. Positioning iTM is strong but not seeing move higher. More likely possible rejection from 100D MA.**



DATA LEDE:

* UK CPI: Headline came out 2.3% vs 2.1% expected. Still down a lot on the 3.2% last month. Hot, but not that bad.¬†
* But if we look under the hood, we see that there are areas of the UK inflation that are heating up.¬†
* Core CPI came 3.9% vs 3.6% expected. Only down slightly from 4.2%
* And if we look at Services in particular, we see Services inflation at 5.9%, much hotter than the 5.4% expected and more or less sticky to last month.
* BOE have been more dovish/neutral recently
* This increases risk of moving more hawkish again.¬†
* Now traders see just 38bps of rate cuts in 2024 after the data, much less than before.¬†
* RBNZ hawkish pause.¬†
* FOMC minutes later.¬†



MARKETS:

* SPX: Flat at 5317. Bounced off high of 5325 again, same as last couple of days.¬† Market will likely remain flat ahead of NVDA earnings and FOMC. WAS A RECORD CLOSE YDAY
* NDX: At record highs. 18,730. 1.5% away from 19k, so can be in view if nVDA earnings come good
* Dow: Flat just under 40k
* GER40: Slightly lower this morning, all just normal profit taking and hedging at these highs, positioning remains bullish.¬†
* HKG50: Flat at 19,202 today, absolutely flat
* OIL: slightly lwoer again. Mostly flat around 78. Was rejected at 80 WTI
* Gold slightly lower today, at 2413. Support still 2400.¬†



FX:

* USD moving slightly higher again, paring some of the post CPI losses.¬† With this, USDJPY continues higher, as yen remains weak after failed intervention. Failed to break 152, hence moving higher.¬†
* EURUSD stuck just under 1.285, bullish positioning. ¬†
* GBPUSD at 1.272. Target looks like 1.28 especially given CPI hot.¬†

**What's Important For Day Traders**

1. The stocks you trade
2. Your knowledge of intraday market behavior
3. Your knowledge of general market behavior and things that affect it
4. Having a good overall strategy
5. Having the funds $$ that match your strategy
6. Mastering your emotions and psychology
7. Technicals

I'm currently on day 26 of a personal challenge and here is my progress and the stocks I traded today:

https://preview.redd.it/mitk87k1mm3d1.png?width=1178&format=png&auto=webp&s=faab97e38098f2bba02b42609e660cdf5a471424

1. The Stocks You Trade

This is my top piece of advice for Day Trading - Research and Trade the Best Stocks

They Rise More Than They Fall

Well above emotion, psychology, and even technicals, I rank your stocks as the number one item that can improve your game. I trade with a list of 20-30 stocks that I research, monitor, and track on a daily basis. I choose stocks with strong fundamentals that have Buy and Strong Buy ratings (Rarely Hold or Sell), Price Targets that are above current price, and higher beta (usually above 1.25). Choosing stocks with good fundamentals increases the odds that your stocks will be trending up more often than down. I combine swing trading with my day trading and if any of my day traded stocks go south on me, I wait for it to rise again. If you're trading good stocks this happens more often than not and usually quite quickly.

Liquidity

Another important aspect of the stock you pick is liquidity. Some stocks have considerably higher volume than other stocks on a daily basis. Others have high volume and volatility on certain days - usually because of news, upcoming earnings releases, etc. Day Traders should be trading in these highly liquid arenas because you are buying and selling stock several times a day. You need buyers and sellers to make this happen. Learn to recognize the difference. I sometimes open the chart of a stock that's on my list and swear I hear crickets - low volume, choppy candlesticks, market looks closed for this stock. When this happens, I don't trade that stock. If you buy shares, there won't be anyone there to take it off your hands. Look for volume.

Momentum

I tend to pick stocks that are part of a group momentum play. I'm currently trading a lot of AI stocks and companies that are related to the AI play. AI is in momentum. AI is the next industrial revolution. Some call it hype, but it's not just hype. AI will improve the revenue, reduce expenses, and increase profits for companies who utilize AI, and every company will have to implement AI to stay competitive. NVDA has 90% market share for AI chips which means almost all companies will be sending money to NVDA. What do these companies do with these chips? They implement racks and racks of servers, ethernet switches, power supplies, cables, transceivers, etc for their AI clusters. They also implement software. And they'll need electricity which is in short supply unless it's solar. The point is, expect all these related industries to also benefit from AI. Trade the momentum as all these stocks are doing well.

Manage Your List of Stocks

Don't just make a list of stocks and only trade those stocks. Your list should be dynamic. It changes based on market conditions, the health of the companies on your list and because other stocks get hot. Today I traded CAVA, a restaurant stock because it's currently hot and is often called the next Chipotle. I also look for times to buy good, trending stocks. For example, today, because of SalesForce, other software stocks dropped in sympathy, along with SalesForce. I see this as an opportunity to buy other software companies that are affected by the SaleForce drop but otherwise are very strong stocks. So, I bought a big position in CRWD which has 48 Buy ratings, 1 hold rating, and 0 sell ratings. It also has a price target of $400 and it closed today at $315.92, down $33.60 because of SalesForce. I expect CRWD to rise next week prior to earnings.

Conclusion

Whether you have good technicals or not. Whether you can control your emotions or not. Whether you understand intraday market patterns or not, you will always benefit from trading great stock with good fundamentals that analysts agree are a Buy or Strong Buy, have good price targets above their current price and have good beta so there's a reasonable amount of volatility. All these things are good for day traders."
2024-06-05 13:29:13,BuyInHigh,How‚Äôd Everyone Do Today?,"I had a solid morning building my prop firm accounts up. Felt what I now realize was overconfidence and switched to personal where I got chopped down to my daily loss limit. 

Feeling a bit frustrated. Gonna go work off my angst on my skateboard and put it down until tomorrow. 

How about everyone else? Hope you had a good trend day."
2024-06-05 15:47:02,accomp_guy,Overtraded today - pissed ,"I was up about +2,000 after the first hour. 
Stopped and went to the gym and told myself no touchy. Be happy with your profits. Don‚Äôt overtrade. 

Well, I decided to start in on some $NVDA puts after the 1200 break out. I took more size than I should have. I got smoked. 
I gave back all gains and ended the day -1,400.

Then I had the smart idea to take 2 option contracts of $NVDA 1250 puts expiring June 14 at $58.00. 

Well. I‚Äôm starting in the hole tomorrow on these most likely over 1,000 I‚Äôd guess probably closer to -2,000.  

My +2,000 day will now be a -3,500 day because I‚Äôm a fucking idiot. So pissed. So upset with myself. Despair. Maybe this isn‚Äôt for me if I can control my overtrading. "
2024-06-05 17:11:12,Lavanger,"Made 30%, could have made 300%. How do you guys deal with profit taking?","Alright hear me out, I been planning this week since Sunday night, watch some news, what to expect from the week, take some notes, put some stocks on my watch list, set up ranges, look up a an economic calendar and see what catalyst we have this week etc. 

Well this week for all you regards it's all around PMI reports and Job reports, sure some foreign banks playing with interest rates, but we don't care about that really, unless you trade Futures or Forex (I don't), I trade US equities we don't care about ECB lowering rates. Earnings season almost over, and although weak, not bad. 

Monday and Tuesday reports pointing to a weak report on Friday, and today was like a confirmation, NVDA doing split on Friday, perfect, we go long. Without even looking at charts, just the ADP report I knew we were in for a 2% day movement. 


Well it's 9:45 and QQQ is already up 1%... should I go long, I mean it's already high enough..

Well, of course, like I said trend days like this tend to be 2% days on average. (For QQQ)

I see it starts a breakout I go long as soon as it starts, no fear.  
I buy 20 contracts, 0dte QQQ. 

Long story short, I sold at 1.25% lol , made $620 instead of $6200. 

Obviously I was checking the chart every 2 minutes after I sold and was pissed I myself, now I am more calm because nobody goes broke taking profit, and I know I did good...
But this is something that always happens to me, I sell and I keep looking at the charts. Only time I'm happy is when I sell for a loss and then it dips further, I'm relived lol

But we all know that's not good, if you put emotions you end up taking more trades etc. How do you guys deal with it? any recommendations? 
Trust me I close the chart only to open it every 5 minutes."
2024-06-06 09:11:15,accomp_guy,Update - new day NVDA,"After my debacle yesterday going green to red in my post here :

https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/s/rMDAhRPweO

I have now turned the tides today and am up just under +5,000 on NVDA today. 
I left for the gym now and am going to try to not trade anymore today. Keep my profits. 
The FOMO in NVDA is here though with it sitting at 1200 on this big gap down going into tomorrow last day before split takes effect. 

If anyone sees me open my computer or trading platform today please slap me and tell my wife."
2024-06-06 16:12:23,Hour_Load_708,I feel like an idiot I keep selling early how do I play this smart,"Last spring I had 2 NVDA shares at $415 each and I sold at $600. Not even a couple months later NVDA started sky rocketing and carrying the 2024 market (Currently at 1200). Fast forward to last Friday I got GME at $23.03 a share with 43 shares. The following Monday GameStop rose to $38 a share so I coulda sold Monday morning and made an extra 700. But since I slept in I ended up selling for $280 profit. Now GME is at $55, excluding the profit I sold it for I fumbled 800 today. Now I feel like shit why do I keep doing this to myself how do I prevent this? It‚Äôs really eating at me I feel absolutely dead. I know these might be rookie numbers for some people but I‚Äôm 17 and my account is valued at 1300 with these GME shares I could have made my profit goal for the entire summer (which was to double my account). Long story short I missed 3 opportunities to double my account to around 2000 one on NVDA and twice in one week on GME how do I stop being an idiot? How can I prevent this in the future?

I get it‚Äôs part of trading and I need to turn off my emotions but I need actual advice I just feel really dead inside and stupid "
2024-06-11 05:47:51,TearRepresentative56,"Im a full time catalyst driven trader and this is my pre market cheat sheet, including all the news, all the updates from WWDC, and all my expectations for the day based on the option data. ","ANALYSIS:

* Market continues to be in a wait and see mode before CPI and FOMC.¬†
* It is a Stable market in positive gamma, so not expecting much volatility unless something extremely unexpected happens. Positioning is bearish on VIX and market makers will be trying to keep a lid on volatility.¬†
* Base case is more chop and range bound before FOMC.¬†
* Skew for SPX is lower. This is because there is some hedging on the option chain, but not much. Less than usual for an event like this. Traders expect CPI to come soft, as oil prices have been in decline in May, so headline should follow.¬†
* We can see that the market is basically pricing in for there to be a VIX crush tomorrow, which is supportive for the markets.¬†
* 5350 still he pivot. Bears will try to get below 5340 where bearish flows will increase.¬†
* Bulls will try to get above 5375. There is strong gamma at 5375.¬†
* 5340 can be a magnet, but let‚Äôs see. Probably more range bound as I mentioned.¬†
* NVDA positioning still looks bullish. Many were expecting a sell the news after the stock split, but we aren‚Äôt seeing this in the data right now to be honest.¬†



DATA LEDE

* UK employment data comes weak¬†
* We have a worst of both worlds type situation going on in the UK labour market - stagflationary even.¬†
* Employment numbers came in at -139k, much worse than the -100k expected. SO market were expecting job loss, but the job loss was more extreme than anticipated.¬†
* Less negative than last couple of months though.¬†
* Unemployment rate ticked up to yearly high 4.4%
* All of that is not bad, as it signals weakening in labour market that is a sign BOE can cut.¬†
* But the Average earnings also came in hotter than expected, at 5.9% vs 5.7% expected. Still near the lows though.
* But this is what scared the FTSE. The hot earnings numbers may make it harder for BOE to cut, but the employment numbers suggest they need to.¬†
* Will call for continued caution overall.¬†
* 10Y Note auction today¬†
* CPI and FOMC tomorrow.¬†



MARKETS:

* SPX: Flat around that pivot of 5350 again. Last few days have bene very low volatility, very flat as traders wait for the FOMC meeting.¬†
* Nasdaq: Flat at 19k this morning, 19k acting as support for now.¬†
* Dow Jones: Flat at 38700, positioning bullish. Can see move above 39k tomorrow or later this week.¬†
* FTSE: Falling after employment data shows average earnings higher. THIs puts spanner in the works for BOE for rate cuts.¬†
* HKG50: lower this morning, bounced off 18k today. 18k is support.¬†
* VIX: Slightly higher, above 13, but positioning is still very short on volatility, so we can expect it to get crushed lower again.¬†
* OIL: slightly lower after bouncing off 78 yesterday.¬†



FX:

* EurUSD hits 1 month low at 1.073. Support is at 1.07 GBPUSD slightly higher, more or less flat, as employment data suggests that BOE can‚Äôt cut so soon, hence hawkish.¬†
* USDJPY slightly higher at 157

2024-06-11 20:09:30,Outrageous_Bid5910,Thoughts on nvda,"### High Demand for NVIDIA's GPUs

#### Key Drivers of Demand

1. **Product Development and Computational Tasks**:
   - **Chatbots and AI**: Companies use GPUs to power AI models for chatbots, virtual assistants, and other natural language processing (NLP) applications. The computational power of GPUs is essential for training and running these models efficiently.
   - **Scientific Research**: High-performance computing (HPC) tasks in scientific research, such as simulations and data analysis, heavily rely on GPUs for their parallel processing capabilities.

2. **Self-Driving Technology**:
   - **Autonomous Vehicles**: GPUs are critical in processing the vast amounts of data from sensors and cameras in real-time to make decisions for self-driving cars. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and others invest heavily in GPU technology for their autonomous vehicle programs.

3. **Robotics**:
   - **Industrial Automation**: Robotics in manufacturing and logistics use GPUs to handle complex tasks, including real-time image recognition, object manipulation, and path planning.
   - **Service Robots**: From healthcare to hospitality, service robots rely on GPU-powered AI to interact with humans and perform tasks autonomously.

4. **Race Towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**:
   - **Major Tech Companies**: Companies like Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft are in a race to develop AGI. This requires building and training extremely large neural networks, which demand substantial computational resources provided by GPUs.
   - **Market Advantage**: The first company to achieve AGI could gain a significant market advantage, driving intense competition and further increasing the demand for high-performance GPUs.

### Implications for NVIDIA

#### Market Position

- **Leadership in GPU Technology**: NVIDIA is a leader in the GPU market, known for its continuous innovation and high-performance products. This positions NVIDIA well to meet the growing demand across various sectors.
- **R&D Investment**: NVIDIA‚Äôs investment in research and development ensures it stays ahead of competitors and continues to deliver cutting-edge GPU solutions.

#### Potential for Growth

- **Revenue Increase**: The diverse and expanding applications of GPUs suggest sustained and potentially increasing revenue streams for NVIDIA.
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Collaborations with tech giants, automotive companies, and research institutions can further boost NVIDIA‚Äôs market presence and revenue.

### Considerations and Risks

1. **Supply Chain Constraints**:

* NVDA positioning update:
* So for this OPEX, we see bullish positioning ITM but slighly more puts opening up. It is slight, but it's there. Lower volumes too. But if we look for a later opEX like August, we can see very bullish positioning OTM. Traders are expecting NVDA to continue rising into August
* Traders look like they are even targeting as high as 150 by then.
* [https://imgur.com/a/vcJXBZ0](https://imgur.com/a/vcJXBZ0)¬†

2024-06-18 18:11:55,Elmksan,What makes a good day trader,"Hi everyone. I've had a RH account for about 4 years now. Over those 4 years I've turned about a thousand dollars into 20,000. Though I frequent WSB, I don't take insane gambles. I usually watch for dips on companies I'm bullish on then buy a long call and am happy to sell it when it reaches a 30 or 40 percent return (and have had a fair share of 200-300+ percent returns). Also have the toughness to suck it up and sell at a loss when the prospects don't look good. It's been consistent for me. I very much wanted to buy NVDA long calls in 2022 but didn't have the money. Very much wanted to buy thousands in Celsius stock when it was a dollar or so. Again, no cash. Could have had a small fortune (for me at least).

The past few days have been different. After a lot of research and gauging the general zeitgeist, I put a lot of money into NVDA, TSM, and ARM calls in the past few weeks and months. Also some AMD awhile back and some Apple. All were options, also with a few thousand dollars in fractional shares of stuff like SMCI, MSFT, and semiconductor and AI ETFs. Long story short, this all came together to give me a 3,200 dollar gain today. I made more money in a few hours than I've made working a regular job in 2 months (Ivy League degree, but I work in education, so I get paid shit despite the fancy degree).

My question is: am I deluding myself into thinking I may be good at this? I feel strongly that I have the emotional intelligence and risk management skills required to day trade. I don't have any fancy technical tools; mostly just look at basic performance charts, P/E ratios, etc. and read a variety of articles from reputable sources. I think I certainly have the capacity though to learn some more sophisticated analytical tools (fairly strong background in math and logic as well a fair amount of exposure to software, coding, etc.).

Should I consider getting into day trading and devoting more time to it, even making it full time? If so, what's my next step? Currently sitting at 22k in my RH account (5K available in margin), as well as a few thousand in Fidelity (all AMAT; another bet I made 6 years ago that's given a huge return).

tl;dr : I've 20+xed my Robinhood investment of 1,000 bucks in 4 years, mostly through bullish long options. Should I consider getting into day trading more seriously?"
2024-06-20 13:33:42,Klaus_Winchester,Lost nearly 8k day trading today,I messed up big time today. This was a loan from my parents too.  I‚Äôm such an idiot I bought NVDA and VRT at the high and kept holding thinking it would bounce back up. But the dang stocks kept dropping today. Finally flattened for an 8k loss. Worked my way back up to -6.5k and now ended day at -7.4k.  Just ranting here.  Please tell me how tomorrow will be since I need to make this money back.  I‚Äôm not gonna be able to sleep till I make it all back. 
2024-06-20 17:19:33,CLEVAkEV,"Losing sucks! Thankfully, today was a breakthrough! (Highly suggested for beginners)","So today was the kind of day that would normally rough me up. I would have been fighting the trend and trying to find the bottom all the way down like a degenerate. ***But I didn't.*** I actually did quite well trading NVDA, SMCI, and NFLX. The past month has been green except for 3 days. And it isn't luck as I take A LOT of trades, mainly small scalps. It is hard to get lucky with my sample size. I don't full port overnight... I day trade only.

Up until April, I was fairly clueless for years. Would go on lucky streaks followed by brutally unlucky ones . Took tons of bad trades that were in the ""buy and hope"" category. Even though I felt an intuitive cringe before taking many of these trades, I still took 'em to prove who knows what to who knows who. And lost a lot of money. It was depressing. I am fairly intelligent and successful person outside of trading... but like a lot of people, trading has often gotten the best of me.

The change... I attribute to two things that I now use religiously everyday: prior day range (not the ***average*** range, the prior day) and market structure (as taught by Stoic and DaveFX). There are lots of market structure teachers on Youtube but I ran into them first so if you have someone you like, let me know. I have spent 6-10 hours a day the last couple months pouring over charts and comparing high and lows, higher highs, lower lows. Over and over. Before, this was something I couldn't get myself to do but now I have to take scheduled breaks as I can go hours without looking away from the screen.

No indicators other than a M1 chart and a fib bracket that with .10/.25/.382/.5/.618/.75/.9 so I can transpose prior day range over the current day. One of my NVDA scalps today was at 129.53 as that was just above 200% of the prior day range. Thought hey, it could go down further but price action was moving sideways and figured the r/R was worth the shot on a 200 shares.

Something just clicked. Charts are much easier to read. I see a story now. Market structure has opened my eyes to how the market actually moves not how I want it to! This has kept me out of my old impulse trades which is the BIGGEST BATTLE a trader can have. If you make impulse trades, it is a double negative as it often leads to losses, mental agitation, revenge trading, and missed legitimate setups. 

Anyways, all the market structure videos and charting led to some kind of neural connection that makes trading a lot easier. To me, trading is an art form. It requires a unique vision. At this point I can sense where price is headed with fairly high accuracy yet my intellectualization of it might fall flat. It is a knowing that can't be explained. The best kind of traders have balanced intellects and intuition, they can both sense and explain. I am not there yet. 

Train your brain and never work again. Lay the foundation. There is no magic, just grit and grind. My account is only $30k but I am now consistently taking 10-20 scalps a day and pulling $200 - $1000 a day out of the market. Taking my time and reminding myself gradual growth is the best kind of growth. The best traders I have run across grinded and sized their way so methodically it wasn't noticed. 

  
Keep grinding!"

I get caught in shorts, bad setups, unpredictable price movements lately. I am very soured by small caps and my strategy. I'd like to move over to mid and large caps. My account is 15Kish, is that enough to trade mid-large caps effectively? What are your favourites more high volume mid and large caps with good price action?"

2024-06-25 12:50:08,Paint_By_Data,Should I and how?,"Without knowing anything I‚Äôve stumbled across $25K in profits (before taxes) this year. Admittedly I got lucky with NVDA early in the year. For the past three weeks I‚Äôve been dipping in and out of various stocks and making a profit (~10k). Again, I‚Äôll chalk this up to luck. 

So this got me thinking. If I play it conservatively, how hard would it be to make $500 daily with a starting amount of 100K? Based on my previous luck - which want day trading but more swing trading - how feasible is this, and where should I start to learn?

I read only about 1% of day traders make a profit. My gut is that is because of trying to make big money. I wouldn‚Äôt consider $500 a day big. Especially if I was using a big stack to make small gains.

  I finally started automating my stop losses instead of doing it manually, and moved them up as profits increased. This really let the winners run moreso than when I am in control of the stops ( I take profit too early)

I gave back about $15k trying to increase my green days this week, but no risk, no reward. I generally increase my buy-size if I'm up for the day by more than I expected.  Today, I was up $8k by 10am, and ended up only profiting $1100. I made many consecutive bad trades but finally hit my stride around noon

I was trading from 3 accounts today. My biggest % return was in premarket when I played NVDL. 6.22%. Hopefully this sheds some light into the process. I loved stuff like this when I was getting my sea legs. (I'm no guru. just trying to make that cheese ya know).   
  
Played Uber in premarket and bought it on the open sell off. Reason being is Uber oversold on the daily and at Jan 24 levels. Door Dash just had great earnings and is seeing nice upward move. Listened to Uber earnings call and doesn't seem like they are affected by the recession. Very good call. Plus we had this mini crash and I expected a nice recovery today like yesterday, so I was willing to hold this as a swing trade if needed. Stocks can always go lower and anything can happen but with all of these stacked in my favor the risk was worth it. Picked up some NVDL when NVDA hit $100 in premarket.

Ok one more bonus one. This is another short on META. I shorted META 3 times today. So I saw this on 5 min and 15 min was showing Bearish RSI divergence. Look how price continues to go higher while RSI continues to exhaust and go lower. It was turning over at least a little bit. I don't need a big move down just a little move or a retracement to make my money.

2024-08-15 11:33:13,CryptographerOk4571,Trading is so damn frustrating! ,"I am so trying to get more out of my winners, but my emotions always get the best of me, and i sell or partial too early.

Just today i was in NVDA and TSLA. I had taken some profits initially and added on to both of them as they were going in my direction. They started chopping around when the market started going down and i ended up selling both of them without waiting for them to come to my breakeven. My thesis was that atleast let me walk away with some profit, than give away all the unrealized profit by waiting them to come to my breakeven. Turned out both of them rallied hard after i sold, and i ended up with literally half the profit then i could have on the day.

If they would have come to my breakeven then my profit would have been even lower for the day, so maybe i should be just happy that i made more by not waiting for the price to come to breakeven, but if i had actually hold i could have made 100% more on what i ended the day on.

My trade execution needs a lot of practice.

2024-08-17 18:48:10,daytradelife1,The Unfiltered Truth About Day Trading Realities,"Day trading. The thrill of making quick profits, the freedom to work from anywhere, and the potential to live a life of luxury. It's an enticing prospect, and many of us have been drawn to its promise.

Many people think day trading is a get-rich-quick scheme, where you simply jump into the market, make a few trades, and voil√†, you're a millionaire. Others believe it's a thrilling lifestyle, where you're always on the edge of your seat, making bold moves, and reaping massive rewards. But let's be real, most of these perceptions are fueled by social media and Hollywood movies. The reality is far from glamorous.

In reality, day trading is a tough business. The failure rates are staggering, with some estimates suggesting that up to 90% of new traders lose their entire trading account within the first few months. Yes, you heard that right ‚Äì 90%! And it's not because they're stupid or lazy; it's because they're unprepared, naive, or simply don't have the right mindset.

The truth is, day trading is a skill that requires dedication, hard work, and a deep understanding of the markets. It's not a hobby or a side hustle; it's a full-time job that demands your attention, discipline, and patience. And even then, there are no guarantees of success.

Let's talk about the realities of day trading. Market volatility is a constant threat, and even the best traders in the world can't predict what will happen next. Emotional discipline is crucial, because one impulsive decision can wipe out your entire account. And education ‚Äì oh, education is key. You need to have a deep understanding of technical analysis, fundamental analysis, risk management, and trading psychology.

But even with all these factors in place, day trading is a game of probability. You can do everything right and still lose. You can follow the best strategies, use the best tools, and still end up in the red. That's just the nature of the beast.

So, what's the key to success in day trading? Is it magic? Is it luck? No, it's actually quite simple. It's about understanding that day trading is a marathon, not a sprint. It's about being consistent, patient, and persistent. It's about adapting to changing market conditions, learning from your mistakes, and constantly improving your craft.

The average trader's experience is a rollercoaster of emotions, with moments of euphoria followed by periods of despair. They're constantly chasing the next big trade, the next big win, without realizing that consistency is the key to long-term success. They're like gamblers, always looking for the next fix, the next rush of adrenaline.

But the few who achieve consistent success ‚Äì they're a different breed altogether. They're the ones who understand the importance of discipline, risk management, and education. They're the ones who take the time to develop a solid trading plan, to backtest their strategies, and to refine their skills.

In conclusion, the allure of day trading is real, but the realities are harsh. It's not a game for the faint of heart, and it's certainly not a get-rich-quick scheme. If you're thinking of becoming a day trader, you need to have realistic expectations, a solid understanding of the markets, and a deep commitment to your craft.

For those of you not familiar with divergences, this is a hidden bearish divergence. You can see clearly that the chart is showing a clear difference in direction compared to the TSI oscillator on the bottom. These clear differences are some of the best trades to take especially for a quick turnaround. 

You can also confirm these directions by adding the TTM Squeeze indicator and the Ultimate Oscillator, if you get the same confirmations on all 3‚Ä¶ Even better. 

I confirm these divergences with the sell signal from TO, meaning I don‚Äôt take the trade unless a signal is fired. I recommend everyone to look into this, even if you don‚Äôt use signals, these are great trades to look for, and high probability.

Let me share a couple rules I have learned to follow over the past few years. 

1. Don‚Äôt trade before 10:30am (1 hour after market open. - This eliminates the higher volatility and usually is able to pick a more profound direction. 

2. Only take trades off of good setups. - This divergence is a good example of a good setup. You have a clear picture where you can place your stop loss (right above the high) and place the trade. Also breaking VWAP, and the 200ma are good places to trade as well. 

3. Set percentage goals on your position size. I NEVER look at the percentage of my account gain, I only look at the percentage that my position size gain is. My usual PT is 30%. Looking at it from this standpoint in my opinion helps grow your account much more consistently. 

Those are just a few things I follow to a T. I definitely encourage everyone to start looking for these types of divergences and just sticking to a strategy instead of flip flopping around which is where most go wrong. 

Stop looking for the home run, baby steps!

I read extensively through the newbies section and couldn't find my answer, online resources seem to agree with me however the answer has been mudded.

  
Yesterday I was flagged PDT by Schwab, I was planning on it, but had two heat pumps go out so 15k gone so I held off on committing.  Saw the PDT flag and called Schwab, this is the scenario that first triggered my 4th day trade in 5 business days.

  
9/11 - Buy NVDA 

9/12 - Buy NVDA (on accident, don't trade with a toddler in your arms or the buy instead of sell button will get hit \*facepalm\*)

9/12 - Sell NVDA, sell order was specific lots from NVDA purchased on 9/11. Still hold shares purchased on 9/12

  
Called Schwab and went back and forth after going on FINRA rules, they looked and said the PDT flag was and error and would be removed (and not be my one time removal)

  
Call again this morning as PDT flag still exists,  Schwab claims the opposite of yesterday, PDT flag remains in effect.

  
I might be wrong, and guessing I am.  But I didn't consider the scenario above a day trade, wrong or right?

2024-09-14 09:35:54,Content_Substance943,Momo Strat For $NVDA,"Fwiw....

  
Backtested a momentum strat for NVDA over the last 30 market sessions. 100% mechanical. No nuance. It was either take 100% profit or 100% loss. No ema, no vwap, no magic. Just used 2 day prior range and %'s.  

  
The R/R was: 1.67 , win was 25% of 2 day prior range, loss was 15% of prior 2 day range. 

  
The strategy: Take hi/low range for last two market sessions combined (I used daily hi/lo indicator on ToS.) Using total prior 2 day range, the play started when price hit the 25% mark in either direction. It is a momentum play, so when price went down 25% of prior 2 day range, it triggered a short  and vice versa. If price momentum stalled and reversed, the stop was at the 10% mark. Take profit was price continuing on to hit the 50% mark. So a loss was 15% of prior 2 day range and a win was 25% of prior 2 day range. 

  
Totals: 

11 LOSSES for a Total of 1547 cents (Average loser was 140 cents)

17 WINS for a Total of 3637 cents (Average winner was 214 cents) 

3 plays were flat ending the day near the trigger bar. "

The main patterns are Intraday Patterns and Annual Patterns. They are important because they can be a guide for how you trade.

**Intraday Daily Market Patterns**

One of the complaints I hear a lot from new traders is they sometimes take a lot of profit in the morning, only to give it up by over trading later in the day. Is this due to overtrading or just trading the wrong stock at the wrong time? In my opinion it has more to do with trading the wrong stock at the wrong time. The market has distinct intraday patterns that repeat pretty much the same way every day and if you know the pattern it can help you make trading decisions on which stocks to ride in the afternoon...or not.¬†

Below is a screen shot of the NVDA chart for Monday June 3rd 2024 which I‚Äôve divided into the various distinct time periods that mark a change in the trading pattern for any given day. Each trading day follows this general pattern. There are primary intraday patterns that divide the trading day into three main parts and several other time frames within the primary divisions.¬†

**Primary Intraday Pattern**

1. **Morning**
   * **High volume**
   * **High volatility**
   * Profit taking from overnight gains
   * Selling from fear of loss
   * FOMO buying pre market gap
   * Buying in General
2. **Midday**
   * **Lower Volume**
   * **Decreasing Momentum**
   * Often Reverses
   * European / London traders exit U.S. market
   * NY Lunch hour
   * Less traders in general after morning session
3. **Afternoon**
   * **Increasing Volume**
   * **Increasing Momentum**
   * Sometimes Reverses
   * Bargain shoppers
   * Investors grabbing new positions
   * Losers finally sell

**4**. 9:30 - 9:45: Market open which is often volatile as traders shed their positions after movement from the day or night before. This could be profit taking and is often seen when a stock gaps up in pre-market and traders sell their positions as the market opens. There can also be a frenzy of buying a stock that just became hot and the opening is often a combination of both in high volume and intensity.¬†

**5**. 9:45, 10:00 - 10:30 - There is often a reversal or big pull pack in volume at 9:45 and the following movement is the stocks trajectory for the morning. Usually around 10:00 the trajectory of a stock will become clear. If a stock posts new highs and lows, the stock will move up until at least 12:00 and could continue longer. If a stock is posting lower highs and lower lows, the stock will move down at least until 12:00 and could continue longer.¬†

**6**. 11:00 - 11:30 -Volume begins to slow considerably as European and London traders end their day and exit the U.S. market. Volume and momentum decrease and reversals often occur.¬†

**7.**¬†12:00 - 1:15 - Volume and momentum slows even more as the NY lunch hour begins. Reversals may happen.¬†

**8**. 1:15 - 2:00 - Volume begins to pick up. The contraction during lunch begins to expand and price breakouts can occur as NY traders return from lunch.

**9.**¬†2:00 - 2:45 - Most stocks may see a reversal during this period. Any trends that developed during or just after lunch may reverse at 2:00 or between 2:15 and 2:45.¬†

**10.**¬†3:00 - 3:45 - There is often a momentum change this time with volume and momentum increasing. Often this is the last chance to take advantage of strong movement within a stock until the final selling and buying at the end of the day. Bargain hunters enter the market and grab low priced stocks at the end of the day or ride the momentum of upstanding stocks. If a stock is dropping, reluctant sellers shed loss positions and bargain hunters snatch them up.¬†

**11.**¬†3:45 - 4:00 - The final 15 minutes may see drastic price movements, price jumps or rapid declines. If you plan to close a position it‚Äôs probably best to do it before the last 5 minutes.¬†

A trader who understands these intraday market patterns will know when to wait before making a trade. If a market slow down is potentially going to happen, a trader may choose to wait a few more minutes before making a trade to determine the new trajectory our to ensure the momentum is still moving in the right direction.¬†

**Annual Repeating Patterns**

The chart below illustrates the general pattern of all the markets. You can see there are common repeating periods where the markets are rising or falling. These patterns can be seen in the overall performance of the markets and stocks for each month. If you look at the annual charts for the markets, they generally follow this pattern with variations. Some years like the pandemic years are anomalies, but for the most part, markets follow this pattern every year. Why is this important?

[Annual Market Pattern](https://preview.redd.it/fh1z4ln0y9pd1.png?width=1188&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f0cb6deeca2120145d4c63bdbcf5d07ed49c3d3)

For me and especially because of my trading style which combines day trading and swing trading, I listen to how the markets breath. I trade more assertively during periods of upswing, less assertively during seasonal periods of decline. I generally day trade stock worth long term investing and only trade the stock when the stock has analyst Buy and Strong Buy ratings and the stock's price is below the average analysts price target. In other words the stock should go up so if I absolutely have to hold a losing stock, I will, if I'm trading in a seasonal upswing. If I'm approaching a seasonal downswing period, I will tend not to hold any stock and make it a point to move out of any Swing positions I have to be ""In Cash"" because I also try to buy Swing positions at a relative low during the worst market periods so I can ride them up during the next incoming good period.

The chart is a stacked chart to easily visualize the up and down of each of the markets and how they coincide. There is no significance for the numbers on the Y axis, except they are used to rank each month in relation to best, worst, good, or bad - historic data. This is a stacked chart and no significance to which market is on top or middle or bottom. They are stacked so you can easily see that all three follow the same annual pattern. This is only a guideline, and every year is different but influenced by the same pressures that create the general pattern."
2024-09-18 16:03:42,Psychological-Touch1,How to search for and find trending stocks?,"Example would be NEON yesterday.  It steadily moved from $9-$12 all day.

I got in at $11.30 and rode it a little this morning.

Sometimes NVDA will steadily trend down or up all day.  Today LUNR steadily trended down all day after reaching a massive gain yesterday after hours.

This type of stock behavior seems like a solid reduced risk day.  Do any of you have any tools or resources that can help identify various stocks that behave like this for the day/week?"

But I love hearing about how other people trade. So in a very short sentence, describe to all of us how you trade.

Try to be as simple as possible, 

I will start

I choose one instrument, example EUR/USD. Then I open 4-5 timeframes of the pair laying in a sequence, so that I see Daily, 4hr,1hr,15min

And then look at probabilities and just trade off support and resistance like a chess game.

2024-09-24 10:17:21,bjmoghadam,Please check my conspiracy theory,"Gotta tap the community before I go nuts.  I'm about 2 years into full-time trading, using ThinkOrSwim daily (Schwab).  I regularly track and trade 3 active stocks, and watch them dip and spike in unison all the live-long day.  As soon as I see my setup, I choose which stock to jump into, usually going with the one I've traded least.  On one hand, I KNOW my few hundred shares aren't dictating the price of NVDA or AMD.  On the other, I'm a friggin' GENIUS at picking the one that DOESN'T move, while watching the others do exactly what I expected based on the setup.  I tell myself, ""patience, dude - don't dump it yet"", and just watch it push down and down, like a bully determined to muscle me out.  When I'm stubborn and try to wait it out, it keeps pushing down until I give up and take a big loss.  When I dump it quickly to avoid the big loss, it suddenly finds its upward mobility and I miss the move entirely.  I've just seen this happen waaaaay too many times to not start thinking something's rotten in Denmark.  Am I alone?  Is it purely psychological?  I know Schwab is a ""payment for order flow"" broker, so my trust factor isn't super high.  Thanks in advance for any perspective (and/or ridicule).  "

There was a gap to fill back down to the $570 level, so in the back of my mind, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for today especially when we started in a downtrend. 

So as you can see, we filled the gap down to $570, and at the SAME TIME, we had a bullish divergence. That to me is a perfect spot to take the trade. 

Grabbed $571 calls when the signal came and it was a slow grind but was able to grab 30% off those contracts. Was really a no brainer and I hope some of you saw the same thing!

I made $800 this week, so should I look at it like this?

$800/$150,000 = +0.53% weekly return

or

$800/$60,000 = +1.33% Weekly return

I have $60,000 of my own money, but using $150,000 to trade which uses my money as collateral. I could be on the hook for the remainder if in under extreme circumstances I were to lose it and didn't get liquidated in time, so I am seeing myself risk $150,000 not $60,000.

This was more than 2 weeks of trading I put in to make that kind of money, pissed off I bought 50 calls of NVDA deep ITM in hopes to make it all back and break even.

I saw myself down -$10,000 unrealized losses, I didn't sell, I was getting prepared for the possibility of wiping everything out the whole $60,000 I had in the calls. The unrealized loss got smaller as the price went back up.

Eventually I was able to close it out with just +$100 profit, but look at what it took! I felt like vomiting and this isn't an exaggeration. $10,000 is a LOT of money to me, what is wrong with me, it looks like I have a gambling addiction of some sort.

And I am still up overall, and made profit end of the year, but I have had a habit of forcing trades, revenge trading, and gambling my weekly gains.

I have a really bad feeling one of these days if I keep this up my luck will eventually run out, and I need to stop doing this not for the sake of my money but for my own mental health. I never had anything raise my heart rate like that without any physical activity. I hated myself for doing this, but relieved I got out without a scratch."
2024-10-01 12:24:37,United_College_7403,Am I missing something?,"Hi guys! First time posting here, and I wanted to share my experience from my first day of trading.

In a few months, I‚Äôll be a father‚Äîspecifically a single father‚Äîand I really need money so I can spend as much time as possible with my son/daughter and give them the best life I can. A few months ago, I started with crypto, but for me, it was too slow. So last week, I came across Trade Republic and its turbo warrants.

The feeling I got from turbo warrants was that they seemed too good to be true. They are highly leveraged derivatives, but to me, they looked like easy money, and I thought the risks could be minimized by just paying attention to the numbers. Still, I felt like something was missing. Nobody gives away money that easily.

Today, I transferred ‚Ç¨1,000 to my account and started trading for just a few minutes. I made ‚Ç¨300 in less than an hour (just by buying and selling NVDA, Gold, Tesla, Visa... turbo warrants). Since it was my first time, I tried to be a bit greedy to see how risky I could get. I ended up losing some money, but the whole experience netted me ‚Ç¨190 in profits.

I know it‚Äôs not a lot compared to some people here who make thousands, but today I earned as much as I would in a day of work (I make ‚Ç¨2,100 a month). Maybe I won‚Äôt make that much money every day, but it really feels like if I‚Äôm not too greedy, I could maintain this level of profit daily.

So, the question is: am I missing something? Or is it really that easy to earn extra money?

**TL;DR:** I made ‚Ç¨190 in a day, and I‚Äôm suspicious it could be like this every day."

This is another example of what I preach in here. Clear difference on the chart compared to the TSI at the bottom. 

Lower low on chart, higher low on TSI. - Bullish divergence. 

Start looking for these setups, super high probability and easy to identify good exit points if it doesn‚Äôt work out.

* I believe from reading rhetoric of Iran‚Äôs chiefs, that their attack is all they really want to do. So if Israel‚Äôs response is measured, it should be the end soon.¬†

MACRO news:¬†

* Euro unemployment rate was 6.4% in line with expectations.¬†
* ADP numbers came stronger than expected. 143k vs 120k expected. That‚Äôs strong. Points to strong NFP on Friday most likely.¬†

I made a total of $3,733.45, since September 18th. There are 252 trading days in a year on average, I keep this up I will make $85,528.80 by next October 2025. I have already 2 years of experience trading the markets. Am I out of my mind thinking this is possible to keep it up or would you believe I'm just on a winning streak just for now?

11 days doesn't seem like enough data to go off of, but I can almost guarantee myself I can make $50 a day trading no problems. but of course $339.40 is almost 7x that amount, but I do have $30,000 more in my account than I had last year.

\[UPDATE\]: DAY 13, my average decreased and is now at $299.86 per day when taking all the gains made from the past 13 trading days and dividing it by 13. As expected the value is decreasing. I'm not getting these lucky win streaks anymore, 13 trading days just makes up for a little over 5% of the trading year, so far I only have 5% of data to rely on compared to a years worth of data."

# Spirit Airlines Explores Bankruptcy

Spirit Airlines ($SAVE) is running out of fuel‚Äîfinancially speaking. After a failed merger with JetBlue, the budget carrier is exploring bankruptcy options, discussing a potential restructuring under Chapter 11 with bondholders. It‚Äôs not looking good for the airline that's been trying to find some altitude amid mounting losses.

Spirit is scrambling to figure out what to do with its $3.3 billion debt, including $1.1 billion of secured bonds coming due soon. CEO Ted Christie has been in talks with bondholders, but let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîthe options are running out. After the JetBlue merger fell apart in January, leaving Spirit in financial limbo, the airline lost the chance to join forces and create the fifth-largest carrier in the US. Now, instead of coasting on JetBlue‚Äôs coattails, Spirit is left battling steep losses and shrinking operations.

With bankruptcy potentially looming, Spirit‚Äôs balance sheet is far from stable. Its operational footprint has been shrinking‚ÄîSpirit plans to slash capacity by nearly 20% in Q4, and it just furloughed 186 pilots. Not to mention, Spirit‚Äôs credit card processor has set an October 21 deadline to refinance or extend its notes.

**A Rocky Ride**  
Spirit hasn't posted an annual profit since before COVID, and even as travel has rebounded, the low-cost carrier hasn't found its footing. Major airlines are getting better at matching Spirit's budget fares, and the recall of Pratt & Whitney engines grounded part of its fleet, making things even tougher.

Routes have been cut, costs are being slashed, but the competition keeps ramping up. The debt clock is ticking, and without a merger to fall back on, Spirit is flying solo through some pretty stormy skies.

With fewer routes, mounting debt, and an increasingly competitive market, Spirit Airlines needs more than just luck to keep soaring.

# OpenAI Raises $6.6 Billion at $157 Billion Valuation

Call OpenAI the Silicon Valley darling‚Äîthis AI powerhouse just scored $6.6 billion in fresh funding, catapulting its valuation to a staggering $157 billion. Thrive Capital, led by Josh Kushner, took the lead with a $1.3 billion investment, while Microsoft‚ÄîOpenAI‚Äôs most dedicated cheerleader‚Äîadded another $750 million to its $13 billion pile. Other heavy hitters like Khosla Ventures, Fidelity, Nvidia, and SoftBank couldn't resist jumping on the AI hype train.

With this cash infusion, OpenAI is officially rubbing shoulders with the elite‚Äîjoining the ranks of the top three venture-backed startups, alongside SpaceX and TikTok‚Äôs parent, ByteDance. But it‚Äôs not just about the dollars; it‚Äôs about strategy. OpenAI is playing it smart by keeping rivals at bay‚Äîasking investors to steer clear of backing competitors like Anthropic and Musk's xAI. Staying on top isn‚Äôt just about innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs about making sure others don‚Äôt catch up.

**Fueling the AI Dream**  
This new funding will power more AI research and expand computing capacity, keeping OpenAI at the forefront of the field. Their star attraction, ChatGPT, now flaunts 250 million weekly active users. But there‚Äôs a price to pay‚ÄîOpenAI expects to burn through $5 billion this year against $3.7 billion in revenue. Developing next-level AI tech isn‚Äôt exactly a budget-friendly hobby.

OpenAI‚Äôs internal shakeups have added to the drama. CEO Sam Altman got the boot and then came back like a Silicon Valley comeback story. Plus, key figures like co-founder Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati have exited, stirring uncertainty. There‚Äôs also talk of ditching the nonprofit label for a for-profit model‚Äîa move that makes investors giddy but could come with its own set of legal headaches.

**Zoom Out**  
AI is more than just cool tech‚Äîit‚Äôs a battleground, and OpenAI is right in the thick of it. Heavyweights like Google and Meta are breathing down its neck, while new challengers are cropping up everywhere. With a potential IPO on the horizon, Sam Altman and his team are betting big on their vision‚Äîand their capital.

Buckle up, because the AI race just went into overdrive.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Brace yourselves‚Äîtomorrow‚Äôs jobs report is shaping up to be a big one. Ever since July‚Äôs job data tanked the market, investors have been glued to these reports. That month‚Äôs lower-than-expected employment numbers had everyone panicking that the Fed might have missed the mark on managing a recession, sending stocks into a nosedive.

August helped ease those fears a bit, with 142,000 jobs added (a nice recovery from July‚Äôs 114,000) and unemployment holding steady at 4.2%. But the labor market remains in the spotlight, especially with the Fed tying future rate decisions to employment data. September‚Äôs numbers? Economists are eyeing 140,000 new jobs, a slight dip but nothing too alarming‚Äîunless it‚Äôs much lower. In that case, October‚Äôs already shaky market could take a serious hit."

Most sectors joined the party, but tech clearly stole the spotlight.
* The Nasdaq jumped 1.45%, and the S&P 500 wasn‚Äôt far behind, up nearly 1%. A dip in oil prices and cooling tensions in the Middle East helped lift markets after their worst session in a month.

# Short Seller Hindenburg Goes After Roblox

Roblox had a rough Tuesday after Hindenburg Research, a notorious short-seller, came swinging with allegations that the gaming platform is playing fast and loose with its numbers.¬†

The report accused Roblox of inflating user data and failing to protect its youngest players from harmful content. Naturally, the stock took a dive, dropping nearly 10% in early trading‚Äîa steep fall for the platform that‚Äôs been a favorite among younger gamers.

**More Bots Than Humans?**  
Hindenburg‚Äôs beef? The firm claims Roblox has been cooking the books by counting bots and duplicate accounts as individual users. According to the report, Roblox's daily user count may be overstated by up to 42%. And while Roblox claims its users are spending hours immersed in the digital world, Hindenburg suggests a lot of that ""engagement"" comes from bots that are just... there.

But the bigger blow? Hindenburg also painted a grim picture of the platform‚Äôs safety features, claiming Roblox isn‚Äôt doing enough to keep predators at bay. And for a platform with millions of young users, that‚Äôs a serious accusation.

**Roblox Fights Back**  
Roblox wasn‚Äôt about to sit quietly. The company shot back, calling Hindenburg‚Äôs report ""misleading"" and driven by the short-seller‚Äôs agenda. In a statement, they emphasized that user safety is a top priority and that the financial metrics they report are accurate.¬†

Roblox's defense comes with some financial backing: the company saw a 22% boost in bookings year-over-year and reported $576 million in free cash flow for the second quarter.

**The Fallout:**¬†Despite the firm‚Äôs aggressive rebuttal, Roblox‚Äôs stock took a hit, falling by 9.4% before regaining some ground. Investors are likely left wondering if Hindenburg‚Äôs accusations will have lasting effects or if Roblox can shake off the controversy like it has before. Either way, it‚Äôs clear that the platform‚Äôs future will be closely watched, especially when it comes to how it handles both its user base‚Äîand the safety of those users.

# China Stocks Lose Steam, Traders Disappointed Without More Major Stimulus

China‚Äôs stock markets went from euphoria to disappointment faster than you can say ‚Äústimulus.‚Äù After weeks of rallying on hopes for a massive fiscal boost, investors were left high and dry on Tuesday when the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced just 200 billion yuan in spending‚Äîway short of the expected 3 trillion yuan. The Hang Seng Index dropped nearly 10%, marking its worst day since 2008, while Chinese stocks lost almost half their gains from an 11% surge earlier in the day.

The market's reaction is a clear sign of a mismatch between investor expectations and Beijing‚Äôs cautious fiscal stance. The rally, driven by monetary easing and government promises, now seems shaky without substantial fiscal follow-through.

**Stocks on a Rollercoaster**  
It wasn‚Äôt just disappointment in the air‚Äîit was a stock sell-off. Bank of China tumbled 5.38%, and the yuan slipped 0.64% against the dollar. The once-booming rally fizzled as investors realized that Tuesday‚Äôs announcement wasn‚Äôt the knockout punch they were hoping for.¬†

Analysts at Jefferies had pegged the potential damage at 175 billion yuan in a worst-case scenario, but Beijing‚Äôs response left the markets wondering if that punch is ever coming.For a brief moment, China‚Äôs stock market had a party‚Äîrising over 30% since late September‚Äîbut the NDRC‚Äôs meager offering effectively ended the celebration.

**Is There More in the Pipeline?**  
While Tuesday‚Äôs lackluster stimulus dampened spirits, some analysts believe the big guns are still on their way. Banks like Morgan Stanley are betting that up to 2 trillion yuan in stimulus could still be in the works. The key question now: Will President Xi pull the trigger before markets lose faith?

For now, traders are left in a wait-and-see mode, with hopes that Beijing will unveil the kind of aggressive fiscal measures needed to fuel a long-term recovery. Until then, investors might need to buckle up for more market turbulence.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow‚Äôs looking like a breather ahead of the CPI report, with wholesale inventories being the main event. This gives us a sense of how manufacturers‚Äô stock levels are holding up. Manufacturing‚Äôs been struggling for a while, but with rate cuts now in effect, we might see a change on the horizon.

We‚Äôll also get a peek at the minutes from the Fed‚Äôs September meeting. While we already know about the half-point rate cut, the backstory on why they made that decision could offer some fresh insights.¬†"
2024-10-08 18:23:19,Scary-Compote-3253,$SPY to $580 this week?,"Missed the initial part of the day today, but did end up grabbing about 30% on the late day run up on $SPY. 

No divergences were spotted here, but as most of you know I also look at the 200ma and VWAP, (PINK AND BLUE LINE). If I see price test but not break below one or two of those, I will typically enter when I see a buy or bullish signal. This is one of my favorite strategies to use simply because it‚Äôs simple. 

Was simply the move today, and it worked out like I needed it to. Who here thinks $SPY hits $580 this week? Lot of factors to consider, CPI, Minutes, etc‚Ä¶ I think if we break ATH we have a real chance to explode. We shall see. 

Hope you guys killed it today! Let‚Äôs keep it rolling. "

2024-10-09 14:41:32,rhbegirl,Another wash sale question,"I know, this topic is probably exhausting for everyone, but I‚Äôm perfectly willing to admit my ignorance. 

First. I‚Äôm bipolar and have severe dissociation. I started trading stocks during an episode so I had no clue what I was doing. It was so bad I don‚Äôt even remember opening the account. Even when I‚Äôm feeling good I shouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near this.

From what I can see, I had a $50,000 account and ended up losing $25,000. I did a TON of wash sales on NVDA all on full margin. I traded from June-August. Literally hundreds, if not thousands of trades. Most shares I ever had was 1000. I did buying and shorting. 

Now that I‚Äôm finally out of the manic episode, I am scared to death of what is going to happen with taxes. I have read probably every post on wash sales but it just isn‚Äôt clicking because I don‚Äôt understand most of the terms. Will all of this even out since I haven‚Äôt traded since August, or am I in store for an IRS nightmare? 

I‚Äôm just scared. Finally feeling better with my mental health and now I have this uncertainty that is making me sick mentally again.

2024-10-15 18:46:51,Scary-Compote-3253,Sometimes simple is best when trading $SPY,"One of my main strategies is trading divergences on lower timeframes, but sometimes especially after volatility starts lowering after market open, it‚Äôs best to just roll after price breaks below certain key levels, which in the case that I look for is VWAP and the 200ma. 

(Pink and blue line on chart)

Do any of you do the same? What timeframes do you look at? I have found this to be very effective especially 30-45 mins after market open on lower timeframe charts. (2,3,4m) 

Would love to hear some feedback. And I hope you all grabbed some profit today, this yielded me about 35% on $583 Puts.

2024-10-17 06:16:34,WinningWatchlist,These are the stocks on my watchlist (10/17),"  
Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader.

  
This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click ‚ÄúShow Images‚Äù at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren‚Äôt recommendations, I‚Äôm following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts.

Some stocks I post may be low market cap. I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like ‚ÄúThoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt \_\_\_ on the watchlist?‚Äù or something answered in the watchlist will be ignored unless you add detail and your own opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you- information is meant to be shared in open discussion. I am not answering questions if I‚Äôm still long or short a stock beyond what I update.

2024-10-18 13:50:51,jabberw0ckee,Swing Trading Vs. Day Trading: F*CK Your Stop Loss,"UPDATE: 

Swing trade vs Day Trading + Hold Overnight Since October 14th Open to October 30 close - NVDA:

Swing % up unrealized 2.06%.                                                   

Day Trade % up realized 20.21%


Long time investor, swing trader, and day trader. I've been doing all three for a while and my girlfriend, who's a swing trader, used to tell me day trading was a Fool's Errand until she saw how profitable I am. One of the ways I illustrated this to her was to compete with her over a period of time as she swing traded stock and I day traded the same stock. As it turned out, day trading was an order of magnitude better at reaping profits than swing trading. The exercise prompted me to experiment with day trading in slightly different ways to figure out profitable, easy ways to day trade and make profits. 

Here's what I've learned about stocks over the years. 

1. Almost all stocks of healthy companies and, especially ETF's (which cycle out bad stock and cycle in good stocks periodically),  trend net upward over time. Sure they go up and down, but overall they go up. 

2. Almost all stock and ETF's make their real gains overnight. [https://www.ccn.com/the-stock-markets-biggest-gains-always-happen-at-the-same-time-each-day/](https://www.ccn.com/the-stock-markets-biggest-gains-always-happen-at-the-same-time-each-day/)

3. Although most gains are made overnight, stock prices swing considerably, up and down, during the intraday. 

4. The markets intraday have repeating patterns. [https://tradethatswing.com/stock-market-intraday-repeating-patterns/](https://tradethatswing.com/stock-market-intraday-repeating-patterns/)

5. The markets also have annual patterns. [https://tradethatswing.com/seasonal-patterns-of-the-stock-market/](https://tradethatswing.com/seasonal-patterns-of-the-stock-market/)

6. Stock with Buy and Strong Buy analyst ratings that are below their price targets tend to trade upward toward that target much more often than not.

Knowing all this, we can infer a trading strategy: 

Find a good stock with lots of upside, high volume, strong buy ratings from analysts, and average analyst price targets above the stocks current price and day trade it aggressively without a stop loss during up trending seasons and hold the stock overnight, every night (well, almost every night). Then, never hold it when a down trending season is approaching.

Take NVDA for example, which has increased 227% over the past year. If you day traded and held NVDA overnight, you'd have made considerably more than 227%. If you consider seasonal downturns which occur mainly in February, June, and September and you day trade without holding the stock overnight and accept any intraday loss - but try to avoid them - you'd make even more $$.

https://preview.redd.it/8zbntxysskvd1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c16ae98b361ef74c7bc126c989a58a93c16a7cc

Anyway, I decided to quantify and collect evidence starting this week and I will continue for this Q4 up trending season. All U.S. markets have their best gains in Q4 from roughly the end of October to the end of December. Often, though, the market continues to make gains until March with a dip in February. 

This week NVDA from Monday open to Friday's close gained -.01%. However, if you day traded NVDA as I did you would have made $$ instead of losing it like a swing trader or long term investor. Look at all those ups and downs on the NVDA chart for this week! Perfectly ripe for Day Trade pickin'!

https://preview.redd.it/mv82q8k3ukvd1.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa926cbdb63efe7f23aff5d2202c3c359082cb60

So, I day traded and held NVDA every night this week and am still holding it. Instead of losing -.01%, I earned over $900. I also day traded a lot of other stock for more profit than just $900, but this is what I earned from NVDA. I'll be continuing this probably until NVDA announced earnings in March 2025.

https://preview.redd.it/8f1hqy7pukvd1.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3862943df5ed00ad5eb402251843e66924e93fb

Day trading is much more profitable than swing trading and long term investing. I often day trade and hold overnight during up trending seasons for the reasons illustrated above. Oh, yeah, I also do not use stop losses. So, F your stop loss.

2024-10-21 14:25:13,lightningnotes,Intermediate Market Education - Where to start,"Hey all,

  
First Reddit post ever, so bear with me. 

I have been trading options on the side since 2021, mainly on RH and TD Ameritrade before it switched to Schwab. I would say I have somewhat of an edge and high risk tolerance, and have had some great days and swings ($10k-$40k) buying naked calls and puts, usually weeklies-2 weeks out, but have of course had many losses as well ($5k -$11k). I typically trade SPY, QQQ, SPX, NVDA, SPX and a few other large caps, and have always taken my own trades. Average account size is usually $2,000-$7,000. I have never really journaled my trades or defined full trade plans, price targets, proper risk management strategies, or a full set of trading rules: Have just entered 2-8 day swings based on levels, sector/market strength, volume, or my own conviction, **or** have gotten lucky catching moves on trend days/news events. (I understand this is not a viable strategy, and I have definitely blown up accounts.) I would say that my 2 edges if any have been swing trading and not being afraid to add size on a trade. I have by no means been a profitable options trader (yet) and do not have the best risk management. I also need to focus on patience.

With that being said, I have worked full time up until recently, and haven't fully taken the time to learn  charting, technical analysis, chart patterns, candlesticks, or a greater understanding of the market. However I usually keep up with market news and monitor price action daily. Have also traded strictly on mobile due to being at work and not having the time to pull up charts or invest a lot of time (work in sales, 50-60 hour weeks). I have been in a few solid discords (Desitrade's Option Insider, The Traveling Trader) and follow many solid traders on twitter, and have leveraged other's charts, resistance/support and supply/demand levels from Twitter/Discord to help influence my trades. While I am extremely thankful and grateful for these resources, I need to learn how to chart and become efficient on my own so I can do these things on my own.

  
I am in a career re-evaluation period and have recently stepped out of my role to consider a few different opportunities, so spending some free time to dive into the markets further. I've bought some books to expand my knowledge (A Complete Guide To Volume Price Analysis, Mastering The Trade by John Carter, Trading in the Zone.) **I am asking for suggestions** on where it would be best to allocate my focus to and where time would be best spent right now for where I am at**,** whether it be getting set up with a broker on desktop, understanding bullish/bearish patterns, paper trading on desktop, analyzing charts, learning candlesticks, etc. What is the most important thing that one should learn first when it comes to options trading and TA? Given I have experience live trading, an understanding of the Greeks, and **some** knowledge on trading. I wish it was the other way around and I hadn't had experience/exposure without learning the basics first, but it is what it is. I did get set up on Tradezella today as well.

I have been watching various videos on YT and getting started on the books, but there is an overwhelming amount of content out there and I'm overwhelmed on where to start to find the most value. I have a lot to learn in every area, and I know my current methods are more focused toward a gambling mentality that is not sustainable.

I've been spending time on TOS and Tradingview playing around with features and indicators, but have had a hell of a time trying to look at/set up charts and navigate these platforms without feeling overwhelmed or helpless. I will honestly say that I've unfortunately never been that great at teaching myself things this technical, but I am willing to commit and I do understand that there will be many learning curves that require patience. I also know that the switch from mobile to desktop will not be easy. 

  
After spending a majority of my focus on trading education over the past week, I don't know that I have what it takes to become a full time trader and I don't believe that is what I want, but I do want to challenge myself and try to learn these skills so I can also have them for a lifetime.

# Goldman Forecasts Just A 3% S&P 500 Annual Return The Next 10 years

Remember those sweet 13% annual returns from the S&P 500?¬†

Well, giddy up because Goldman Sachs is here to rain on the parade. According to their latest forecast, U.S. stocks will deliver a measly 3% annualized return over the next decade. That‚Äôs a far cry from the gains of the past ten years, where tech giants like Nvidia and Apple led the charge.

Goldman‚Äôs David Kostin and his team crunched the numbers and blamed sky-high valuations and an overly concentrated market.¬†

Right now, a small handful of mega-cap stocks hold the market together, but history shows it‚Äôs tough for companies to keep that kind of momentum going. In short, expect a major slowdown.

**Bonds, Small Caps, and Equal Weight ‚Äì Oh My!**  
So where‚Äôs the opportunity? Goldman suggests that bonds might actually outshine stocks in the next ten years‚Äîgiving them a 72% chance to outperform. The equal-weight S&P 500 is another hot tip, since it spreads the love to smaller players, unlike the current market-weighted index that‚Äôs all about the big boys.¬†

Speaking of smaller players, small-cap stocks might be worth a look too‚Äîthey tend to do well when the market‚Äôs top-heavy.

**Not Just Goldman‚Äôs Gloom**  
Goldman‚Äôs not the only one predicting a bumpy road ahead. JPMorgan is a bit more optimistic, but still expects returns to be less than stellar, projecting about 6% for the next decade.¬†

Both banks agree on one thing: high inflation and inflated valuations are set to hold stocks back. So, if you‚Äôve been banking on those double-digit gains sticking around, it might be time to rethink your strategy.

In a nutshell, the ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù think the stock market is cooling off, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt find ways to win‚Äîyou just might need to play it a little differently.

# Disney will name Bob Iger‚Äôs replacement in early 2026

Bob Iger‚Äôs retirement saga continues! Disney announced it will name Iger‚Äôs successor in early 2026, pushing the date back once again.¬†

While Iger initially planned to hand over the reins by 2024, it seems like the Mouse House isn‚Äôt ready to let him go just yet. James Gorman, former Morgan Stanley CEO, will step in as board chairman in January, guiding the search for the next CEO.

This extra time gives Disney more runway to evaluate candidates‚Äîboth internal and external. But with Iger‚Äôs direct reports like ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro and Disney Experiences‚Äô Josh D‚ÄôAmaro already in the mix, the board has its hands full figuring out who gets to lead one of the world‚Äôs biggest entertainment companies.

**Enter Gorman: The Succession Whisperer**  
Disney‚Äôs had a rocky road when it comes to CEO handoffs (remember the Bob Chapek debacle?).¬†

Now, with Gorman steering the board‚Äôs succession planning, investors are hoping for a smoother ride. Gorman‚Äôs experience in pulling off a seamless CEO transition at Morgan Stanley has earned him serious cred, and Disney is banking on that magic to avoid another leadership disaster.

Gorman takes over from Nike Executive Chairman Mark Parker, who‚Äôs stepping down after a nine-year stint on the board. Some are saying Gorman‚Äôs outsider perspective might finally bring the fresh, independent leadership Disney‚Äôs board needs after being so closely tied to Iger for years.

**Who‚Äôs Next in Line?**  
Four big names are in the running for Disney‚Äôs top job, and they‚Äôve all had their turn in the hot seat. Josh D‚ÄôAmaro, who oversees Disney‚Äôs theme parks and cruise lines, is one of the favorites.¬†

He‚Äôs got a solid public profile and is leading the company‚Äôs $60 billion park expansion. Meanwhile, Dana Walden has made waves in TV and streaming, but her limited experience in other divisions could hold her back.

Then there‚Äôs Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN‚Äôs sports king, and Alan Bergman, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, who‚Äôs deeply embedded in Hollywood. Of course, there‚Äôs always a wildcard‚Äîan outside candidate waiting to swoop in.¬†

For now, Disney has plenty of time to decide, but whoever lands the role will have some massive shoes to fill.

You also had a transaction from Thursday at 139.16 that had not touched yet aside from when the initial order came in.

# Apple And Goldman Sachs Ordered To Pay more Than $89 Million For Apple Card Failures

Apple‚Äôs reputation for intuitive design hit a snag with its Apple Card.¬†

Partnering with Goldman Sachs, Apple aimed to streamline credit card use, but the user experience didn't live up to expectations. The result? A hefty $89 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for mishandling consumer disputes and misleading customers about interest-free installment plans.

The fines, split between Apple and Goldman, come after issues that affected thousands of Apple Card users, particularly around dispute resolution and installment payment options.

**Where Apple Fell Short**  
  
At the heart of the problem was Apple's design for reporting billing errors. The process was supposed to be seamless, but many users were left frustrated when additional forms were required, and disputes weren‚Äôt properly sent to Goldman Sachs for investigation.¬†

On top of that, Apple‚Äôs checkout process confused customers by not making it clear they needed to opt into interest-free payments for Apple products. This led to unexpected interest charges for many.

**Goldman‚Äôs Role in the Mess**

Goldman Sachs didn‚Äôt escape the CFPB‚Äôs scrutiny either.¬†

The bank faced a slew of complaints over how it handled disputes once they were forwarded by Apple. Many disputes weren‚Äôt acknowledged within 30 days, and investigations often fell short of federal standards.¬†

The situation was worsened by Goldman‚Äôs failure to communicate how refunds and interest-free payments would work, leading some customers to rack up unnecessary interest.

While both Apple and Goldman have taken steps to resolve these issues, this situation serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of over-promising simplicity in financial products.

# TKO Group To Acquire 3 Businesses From Endeavor For $3.25 billion

TKO Group, the owner of UFC and WWE, just went shopping‚Äîand they didn‚Äôt hold back.¬†

In a $3.25 billion all-stock deal, TKO is scooping up three sports-related businesses from Endeavor Group: Professional Bull Riders (PBR), On Location, and IMG. Not only does this bolster TKO‚Äôs portfolio, but it also pushes Endeavor‚Äôs ownership stake in the company from 53% to a commanding 59%.

The deal isn‚Äôt just about grabbing new leagues. TKO‚Äôs getting a piece of the action in premium hospitality (On Location) and sports media rights (IMG). This move positions them as a heavyweight not only in sports leagues but in everything from ticket sales to media strategy. Sounds like TKO is aiming for a bigger slice of the sports entertainment pie.

**TKO's Stock Buyback and Dividends: Sweet Deal for Investors**  
  
Along with the big buy, TKO is treating its shareholders to a little extra love. The company announced plans to buy back up to $2 billion in stock and kick off quarterly dividends of $75 million.¬†

That's a solid move considering TKO's cash-generating capabilities, and it sends a clear signal: they‚Äôre serious about rewarding their investors.

TKO‚Äôs shares took a dip following the news, sliding 5.9% in early trading, but the long-term play seems geared toward solid growth. With UFC and WWE already under their belt, adding PBR and IMG only deepens TKO‚Äôs stronghold on live sports and media rights.

**What‚Äôs Next for TKO?**  
  
As TKO‚Äôs President, Mark Shapiro, pointed out, this is no small acquisition. PBR hosts over 200 events a year, while On Location is known for luxe packages at major sports spectacles like the Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup.¬†

IMG, on the other hand, is a major player in media rights deals for everything from the NFL to the English Premier League. That means TKO is moving beyond just operating leagues‚Äîthey‚Äôre stepping into a full-scale sports entertainment empire.

No more shopping from Endeavor, though‚Äîat least for now. Shapiro made it clear that TKO‚Äôs not looking to buy more assets from its parent company.¬†

But as Endeavor goes private, TKO seems primed to snatch up other opportunities in the sports and entertainment world, positioning themselves as a giant in the industry.

* Here, CEO said: We've been working hard at profitability. Steve Huffman said Reddit is growing revenue ""substantially faster"" than costs. Reddit is a place advertisers need to be, he noted.

**AMD: - Current quarter numbers not actually bad.¬† it was the guidance miss that killed them in this print. Even though this was a result of supply constraints, I think it is an issue tbf that they are in a. Massive Ai cycle yet they are not hitting the numbers they should be. When you look at what TSM reported for instance, and what NVDA will probably report its clear AMD is not ready to compete with NVDA.**¬†I do still think there a chance this one pares losses, however.¬†

2024-10-30 16:33:14,Brave-Hedgehog-1834,Risk % to include PDT minimum?,"For US based traders, with the 25k PDT restriction:

TL;DR:
I have a 1% daily max loss of account, divided by 10, for a 0.1% risked per trade, just so i get enough screen time before maxing out for the day.
Do you set your max daily risk % according to your overall account balance, or just the capital you have above the 25k PDT requirement? 


Ok, on to the more long winded post:
I'm in my 2nd horrible month (almost 2months with mostly red days) daytrading stocks on demo with the DAS platform. I MAY feasibly be able to actually have 30K usd to trade with in a year or 2. Potentially more, but i want to start real slow. So i set my demo account to 30k. My actual broker (which ive never actually used) is an IBKR margin account with $1 fee per order.

When calculating position size/stop loss for a 1% max daily loss of my account, that's $50. When i hit $50 loss, i quit for the day. 

Why $50? Because i figure i should trade on my capital OVER the 25k PDT rule so if I blow it, im not in the hole 25k and have to make that all back just to daytrade again.

Following SMBC's Mike Bellafiore's rules, i also should  allow for 10 consecutive losses before i hit that max daily loss of $50. Just to ensure i can still get enough screen time. So that's a $5 loss per trade. I tried that for a day, and the commissions were overwhelming with such small profits. So i usually do $10 risk per trade. But I still suck and am hitting my max daily loss a lot of days after only 5 trades. 

Im also tryna trade megacaps like TSLA and NVDA lately becasue i was getting absolutely demolished on slippage tryna play momo stonks a la Ross Cameron style. So obviously these expensive stocks are hard to play with such small risk capital.

So do you set your risk % according to your overall account balance, or just the capital you have above the 25k PDT requirement?

So far ive lost $1000 of that 5k this morning, and im wondering if my risk is too small, for the commisions i pay."
2024-10-31 07:14:24,Imaginary_Food_8592,This is called market crash ?,"Guys, NASDAQ is RED overall. Is this the market crash or will there be more before and after election next week because I‚Äôm planning to buy some long term stocks like NVDA. Is this the right time to buy or on coming Monday. Please advice "
2024-10-31 17:10:51,Significant-Mud-2377,How do you guys set your SL? Do you believe in Riskmanagement?,"https://preview.redd.it/uf64sk0wi6yd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=94d2c64967d37c52ea533b680de9a17f7541166a

I have been using the Bar Replay on Tradingview to test my stategy and noticed that my Max Drawdown is huge compared to my overall profit but if I tighten my SL then I get stopped out. On one side most of the trades worked because my RR was somewhere around 1 or even lower but on the other side I dont really have good risk management. What criteria do you have for when you are placing your stops? Like RR or Key Areas etc."
2024-11-01 04:48:01,TearRepresentative56,"I'm a full time trader and this is the premarket report I made, summarising everything important going into the trading day. 01/11","MACRO NEWS:

* The big one is the NFP data today. Expected at 101k. Analyst estimates vary wuite a bit. I think the hurrican impact is relatively unknown and is causing this variation. We want to see a middle of the road print. Not too hot, not too cool.
* China october sees first increase in new and existing home sales after 8 months of decline. Goes to suggest that sitmulus is somewhat working. This is bullish for Oil.
* UK house prices come in weaker than expected.

MARKETS:

* SPX - big dump yesterday dragged primairly by megacap tech, down to the 50 SMA at around 5700. Trying to stabilise now above that ahead of jobs numbers.
* nasdaq - got dragged the hardest yday vs SPX as it is heavily exposed to tech. Broke below 20k. QQQ broke key support levle of 485.5. Has since recoverd this this morning though, dragged up by AMAZON which has pulled up other semis.
* Ger40: held above the purple box. dropped to 50d SMA then held above.
* HKG50: higher today because of news regarding new and existing home sales turning positive after 8 negative months.
* GOld recovering some of the sell off dyay. positioning remains v strong.
* Oil seeing tailwinds clearly on the fact that there is currently heightened geopolitical unrest in middle east again. israel says they are on high alert for an Iranian attack.

FOREX:

* BOJ TO PROCEED WITH GRADUAL RATE HIKES BASED ON DATA DEPENDENCY. even the mention of rate hikes causes some hawkishness in Yen, but it is not really saying much.
* GBPUSD dumped yesterday whilst EURUSD was higher. This disconnect points to the fact that theres probably an opporutnity in gbPUSD right now.
* Dollar continues to enjoy strength into the election on uncertainty and the prospect of a trump victory which would likely bring tariffs

BIG BEAT ON IPHONE. MARGINS WERE STRONG

CHINA LAGGED

SERVICES LAGGED

# Takeaways

* **EXPECTS Q1 REVENUE TO GROW IN LOW TO MID SINGLE DIGITS YOY**
* Additionally, Apple forecasts double-digit growth in services revenue, similar to FY24. Gross margin is expected between 46%-47%, with OpEx around 15.3%.¬†
* Furthermore, The company anticipates operating income and expenses to be roughly -$250M, excluding mark-to-market impacts, and a tax rate near 16%.
* says more Apple Intelligence features will be ""rolling out in the coming months"" and confirmed iPhone integration with ChatGPT is set for December.

# MY TAKE:

* Better than expected eps and revenue. Really, was better than expected imo.
* the only reaosn its down is ebcause it was trading at 35x earnings. Thats why we are seeing analysts UPGRADING their price targets on it. They actually think the earnings IMPROVED their outlook on it. I think this could be true as it has helped to remove some of the cloud over their iphone numbers.¬†¬†
* Interest in apple intelligence is actually strong right now, which alleviates a lot fo the concerns around Apple
* Gradual rollout may mean that it is hard to know how future sales will be which is a problem in trying to come up with a valuation for the company.¬†
* Services were strong
* Better than expected earnigns in my opinion.
* Is only down because its trading at 35x earnings,

AMZN:

# Takeaways:

* Absolutely massive beat on EPS 1.43 vs 1.16.
* FOCUSING ON AI:
* Expects FY24 CapEx around $75B‚Äîprimarily for AWS and generative AI. CEO Jassy calls it a ‚Äúonce-in-a-lifetime opportunity‚Äù and anticipates CapEx growth continuing into 2025.
* CFO added CapEx will increase by 30% next quarter and even more, with the majority focused on AI.
* NO DIVIDEND OR BUYBACK ANNOUNCED
* AWS AI business is now a multi-billion-dollar revenue run-rate, growing at a triple-digit YoY rate. It‚Äôs scaling more than three times faster at this stage than AWS did in its early days. ""We felt like AWS grew pretty quickly.""
* ""considerable upside"" in ad revenue, with AWS as the ""partner of choice."" Generative AI is used ""pervasively"" across its business and devices.
* international unit is on track for record profit this fiscal year‚Äîits 2nd profitable year since 2014.
* Some analysts also project profits from this segment could top $5B next year, driven by improved warehouse and delivery systems in key markets like Germany and the UK.
* AMZN even says that their chips are doing well as some customers are saying that NVDA chips are a bit expensive. Aggressive push into chips continues.¬†

# My take:

* The lack of dividend/buyback announcement was a bit disappointing. However, the earnings were v strong across the board
* AWS was awesome - growing extremely quickly. Ad revenue side of business is doing exceptionally well
* Well positioned in ecommerce, higher volumes pointed to.¬†
* AWS is evolving to accommodate GEnAI and their CAPEX will support them in long run.¬† ¬†Medium term and long term story I think is strong

2024-11-01 11:25:45,crystal_castle00,Share your premarket gameplan for NVDA Friday 11/01?,"I was heavily short biased and heavily mistaken. It turned out to be the worst short of the day. Luckily i adapted quickly and closed my day at b/e but I'd really like to know how you guys read the setup.

Please share your thesis with me.

My short bias was primarily driven by the daily breakdown from consolidation and the 5min chart showing topping action in premarket (same on 60min) - I was looking for a continuation move to the downside. Also camarilla pivots were setting up nicely for an R4/R3 short."
2024-11-04 06:15:00,TearRepresentative56,Premarket report 04/11 - all the news in one place.,"MARKETS:

# Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs Cash Fortress Tops $300 Billion

Warren Buffett‚Äôs cash stash at Berkshire Hathaway is looking more like a cash fortress, ballooning to a record-breaking $325 billion.¬†

It‚Äôs a fortune even Buffett isn‚Äôt sure how to spend, as he keeps dodging big-ticket buys and instead cashes out on old faves like Apple and Bank of America. Why the hoarding? Some say he‚Äôs just too seasoned to overpay in today‚Äôs market; others think he‚Äôs plotting something big.

Either way, he‚Äôs showing us what real self-control looks like.

**Apple on a Diet, Cash on a Bulk-Up**

Buffett trimmed Berkshire‚Äôs Apple stake by another 25% this quarter, whittling it down to $69.9 billion. Even though the iPhone maker still holds the crown as Berkshire‚Äôs biggest holding, it‚Äôs clear Buffett‚Äôs leaning out the tech exposure.¬†

The kicker? This isn‚Äôt a tech-love breakup, just a careful rebalancing to make sure Apple doesn‚Äôt end up becoming the whole show.

**Buybacks? Not This Time**

Usually, Buffett‚Äôs all about scooping up his own shares when Berkshire‚Äôs cash pile is high, but this quarter, buybacks took a timeout. And that‚Äôs surprising, given Berkshire‚Äôs been on a 25% winning streak this year.¬†

Analysts speculate he‚Äôs holding out for the¬†*really*¬†right moment to jump back in‚Äîbecause why not, when cash is stacking up faster than Wall Street can blink?

**Cash-Burning Dreams:**¬†So, what‚Äôs next for Buffett‚Äôs billions? Will he finally splurge on something big, like a mega-acquisition? Or is he playing the long game, waiting for stock prices to cool off before making any serious moves? One thing‚Äôs clear: the Oracle of Omaha knows patience is a virtue‚Äîand he‚Äôs got the cash mountain to prove it.

# Palantir Reports Record Profit, Cites ‚ÄòUnwavering‚Äô AI Demand

Palantir just dropped a knockout earnings report, sending its stock up 15% after hours. Revenue shot up 30% in Q3 to $725.5 million, leaving analysts' forecasts in the dust. But the real kicker?¬†

Demand for Palantir‚Äôs AI tech in the U.S. is off the charts, setting the company up for a stellar year with a new revenue target of nearly $2.81 billion.

**The U.S. Appetite for AI**

Business is booming stateside, with commercial revenue up 54% and government revenue climbing 40% year-over-year. CEO Alex Karp didn‚Äôt hold back, describing this as ‚Äúunwavering demand‚Äù that‚Äôs positioning Palantir front and center in an AI-powered revolution.

The U.S. government‚Äôs appetite for advanced data tools is a big driver, making Palantir‚Äôs AI solutions essential for organizations seeking smarter, more efficient operations.

**Boosted Guidance Lights Up Investors**

With a solid quarter under its belt, Palantir has raised its guidance, now expecting full-year revenue to land between $2.805 and $2.809 billion‚Äîwell above Wall Street‚Äôs estimates.¬†

Q4‚Äôs forecast looks equally strong, with revenue projected as high as $771 million. Given AI‚Äôs moment in the spotlight, investors are betting on Palantir‚Äôs long-term potential in this high-stakes arena.

**Global Hiccups, U.S. Dominance**

While the U.S. powers Palantir‚Äôs growth, international sales are a mixed bag, particularly in Europe, where commercial revenue slipped this quarter. Yet Karp remains optimistic, seeing the U.S. as the core of Palantir‚Äôs AI growth.¬†

As these tools become integral across industries, Palantir‚Äôs strong domestic foothold could keep it leading the pack, even as it navigates a few global bumps.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Two economic reports are due tomorrow‚Äîthe ISM Services Index and a snapshot of the U.S. Trade Deficit. But, let‚Äôs face it, neither will come close to stealing the spotlight from the presidential election.

Election night means noise, lots of it. And with every update and needle movement, it‚Äôs tempting to hit the panic button. But seasoned investors know the real trick: tuning out the chaos and sticking to their strategy.

Here‚Äôs the game plan‚Äîkeep calm, keep steady. The ones who make it big aren‚Äôt the ones glued to every election twist but those who play the long game, staying true to their plan no matter what.

# Before Market Open:

* **Ferrari**¬†has been cruising on pure brand power. While most of the luxury market is slowing down, Ferrari‚Äôs ultra-wealthy customers barely feel the pinch, happily shelling out for a supercar that hits 0-60 in just 2.4 seconds. With a waiting list that stretches well into the future, Ferrari‚Äôs got smooth sailing for months, and management will likely be popping the champagne tomorrow to toast another year of market-beating gains. Consensus: $2.19 EPS, $1.79 billion in revenue. ($RACE)

# After Market Close:

* Meanwhile,¬†**Super Micro Computer**¬†has found itself in hot water. A damning short-seller report, a DOJ investigation, and the sudden exit of its independent auditor have all hit within weeks. Investors are expecting answers in tomorrow's earnings call, but clarity? That might be harder to come by. Consensus: at this point, who really knows? ($SMCI)"

2024-11-06 10:30:50,Dangerous-Time-7819,I have a capital of $100. How do I trade/enter & Should I risk around 5% on stocks like these?,"My scanner runs for stocks <$20, relative volume pretty high, and >10% change. Although I faced a problem attempting to trade those stocks; The market is either very sideways, unpredictable, gains/loses slowly. (I‚Äôm aware that‚Äôs how 80% of the stocks work)

So, the question is as a very small account beginner, should I take the trade on these types of stocks or pass them and find very volatile penny stocks with an uptrend as I only have a strategy for this condition?

And if You were to take those trades, how would you go about doing so? I‚Äôm trying to expand my strategy on entries for these specific type of stocks but have no clue how.

Am I being too ambitious? Unrealistic? Thanks guys."

# The Trump Trade Is So Back

With the confetti barely settled, Wall Street is jumping on the ""Trump Trade"" bandwagon, cheering on the promise of tax cuts, deregulation, and a whole lot of American-made everything.¬†

After Trump‚Äôs decisive win, investors seem ready to party like it‚Äôs 2017 all over again, driving stocks higher in celebration.

**Stocks Soaring, Banks Roaring**

In true Trump style, the biggest winners were unsurprising: Trump Media & Technology Group ticked up 6%, and Tesla shot up a whopping 15% as Elon Musk fans speculated his next role could come with a White House Cabinet badge. B

anks were also in for a big day with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo seeing double-digit gains‚Äîinvestors banking on lighter regulations are here for the ride.

Crypto fans are grinning ear-to-ear as Bitcoin hit a new high at $76,000, with Ethereum and Coinbase riding the wave of Trump‚Äôs pledge to make the U.S. the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the planet.‚Äù And oil‚Äôs back in play, with fossil-fuel giants like Exxon enjoying a lighter-touch regulatory future.

**Clean Energy, Not So Much:**¬†Not every sector is feeling the love. Green energy stocks like First Solar and Enphase Energy took a beating, down 10% and more, with the Invesco Solar ETF trailing alongside. Investors are worried Trump‚Äôs clean energy cuts could halt momentum for solar and wind.

**Bonds, the Dollar, and All That Jazz:**¬†Treasury yields popped as bondholders braced for a more inflationary, debt-ridden policy path. And the dollar? It‚Äôs on a tear, seeing its biggest gain since 2020 as a higher tariff policy puts a chill on imports, boosting the greenback.

**The Bottom Line:**¬†While Wall Street‚Äôs in a post-election high, the experts are wary. Veteran investor Leon Cooperman warned that traders might be ‚Äútoo optimistic,‚Äù and some analysts say it could be short-lived. For now, the ‚ÄúTrump Trade‚Äù seems full steam ahead, but as always in markets, it‚Äôs best to keep one hand on the exit.

# Prediction Markets Are Having Their Moment

Betting markets took a big W this week, as former President Donald Trump‚Äôs election win confirmed what sites like Kalshi and Polymarket have been shouting for weeks: the odds were in Trump‚Äôs favor, despite what the polls claimed. With bets pouring in as high as 70% for Trump on some platforms, it seems political markets may just be stealing the predictive spotlight.

Prediction markets are officially having a moment. Platforms like Kalshi, Polymarket, and even Robinhood are diving into event-based trading, allowing users to bet on anything from presidential outcomes to rainfall odds.¬†

For Wall Street pros and everyday bettors alike, these markets offer a new way to speculate‚Äîand maybe even profit‚Äîon real-world events. The appeal? While traditional investments hinge on long-term trends, event-based trading lets users cash in on predictions in real-time, giving them a front-row seat to high-stakes, headline-driven market moves.

**Trump Odds Surge, Betting Markets Get Serious**

The betting markets were on fire leading up to the election, with millions poured into wagers across various platforms. Kalshi, the only legal site for U.S. election betting, saw over $250 million in wagers, but Polymarket, the grey-market crypto platform, took it to the next level with over $3 billion in bets.

Robinhood even joined the game, rolling out election contracts a week before the final votes were counted. Clearly, everyone‚Äôs trying to cash in on this new political betting boom.

**The Winners, Losers, and Future of Election Betting**

On the winning side? Tesla, Bitcoin, and Trump Media all enjoyed post-election bumps. But this newfound love for political markets has the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) eyeing tougher regulations. They‚Äôre worried that this craze for betting on real-world events could be too risky for the average trader.

So, for now, betting markets are riding high, basking in the glow of their big election night win. Whether they‚Äôll continue this streak without regulation raining on their parade? Only time (and a lot of bets) will tell.

# 

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow‚Äôs lineup starts with initial jobless claims‚Äîaka, the latest pulse check on how many folks are filing for unemployment. It‚Äôs a big deal for the Fed‚Äôs next rate move, though by the time these numbers hit, Jerome Powell and the crew will be locked in on their decision.

So, what‚Äôs the verdict? Analysts are betting hard on a 0.25% rate cut, and markets seem to agree, pricing in the odds of a trim at a cool 99.6%. It‚Äôs a smaller dip than the one in September, but that‚Äôs the Fed keeping things steady. The labor market‚Äôs been flexing some strength lately, so no need for the summer‚Äôs panic-fueled, jumbo-sized cuts.

But don‚Äôt get too hung up on the rate cut itself. Eyes should be on Powell‚Äôs press conference later in the day. The man‚Äôs words and the Fed‚Äôs follow-up chatter could tell us a whole lot more about their game plan for the months ahead.

# Before Market Open:

* **Planet Fitness**¬†banks on members who sign up, then conveniently forget to show up. But the FTC‚Äôs new ‚ÄúClick-to-Cancel‚Äù rule could make those ‚Äúset-it-and-forget-it‚Äù memberships harder to hold onto. The rule, aimed at simplifying cancellations, is still under legal review, so the company‚Äôs stock hasn‚Äôt taken a hit just yet. But if this rule sticks, Planet Fitness might need a new game plan to keep revenue pumping. Analysts forecast $0.58 EPS and $285.87 million in revenue. ($PLNT)

# After Market Close:

* **Pinterest**¬†has been on a wild ride lately‚Äîa strong spring, followed by a tough summer slump thanks to lackluster guidance that sent shares tumbling. But now, with the stock looking relatively cheap, investors are tuning in to see if AI can be the growth engine Pinterest needs. All eyes are on management‚Äôs plans for AI-powered user engagement and revenue growth. Wall Street expects $0.34 EPS and revenue of $896.31 million. ($PINS)"

See what one deviation from standard practices and rule can do.

The day started, I had no patience for anything, I felt invincible and as opposed to trading SPY like I normally do, or better yet, recognize and act on the fact that I wasn‚Äôt feeling it that day, my brain manipulated me into NVDA after it broke resistance, as opposed to my edge, of waiting for the retest to jump in, but NVDA would not slow down here, wouldn‚Äôt it? 

Well, guess what‚Ä¶ it retested and broke down, I kept averaging down (another red flag) and kept on holding until I gave up and closed the trade.

That day, was Oct 7, 2024, another financially painful lesson in the world of trading.

Believe it not, I actually ended the day feeling great, realizing that it‚Äôs a great opportunity to re-prove myself that the edge I have isn‚Äôt a fruit of my imagination.

The day after I got back on the horse, utilizing my regular system which proved great results in a more aggressive fashion and got back into the trend, still averaging 1-2 mins per trade and focusing on 0dte. More progress to come‚Ä¶ stay green folks."

# Vaccine Stocks Catch a Cold on Kennedy's Nomination

Vaccine stocks felt the pain Thursday after President-elect Trump tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal vaccine skeptic, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).¬†

With Kennedy‚Äôs track record of challenging vaccine safety, investors quickly hit sell on big names. Moderna ($MRNA) slid 5.6%, Novavax ($NVAX) lost 7%, while Pfizer ($PFE) and BioNTech ($BNTX) joined the red tide.¬†

The market‚Äôs verdict? Kennedy‚Äôs policies could shake up the sector, potentially eroding public confidence and tightening regulations.

**Uncertain Times for Vaccine Makers**  
  
For an industry already coping with waning COVID-19 vaccine demand, Kennedy‚Äôs HHS role injects new uncertainty. His anti-vaccine advocacy‚Äîand leadership of Children‚Äôs Health Defense, an anti-vax group‚Äîhas industry players and investors bracing for possible policy headwinds.¬†

Vaccine manufacturers now face the risk of reduced immunization rates, which could pressure their bottom lines even further.

**Biotech Takes Note**  
  
Kennedy‚Äôs views extend beyond vaccines, casting a shadow over the wider biotech sector. With his skepticism about pharmaceutical companies, market watchers anticipate potential shifts in health policy that could impact drug development, approval timelines, and sales.¬†

Analysts are on alert, viewing Kennedy‚Äôs influence as a wildcard that could affect drugmakers‚Äô performance across the board.

**Stock Market Reaction**  
  
The market is clearly concerned, and health stocks could be in for a bumpy ride if Kennedy‚Äôs nomination is confirmed.¬†

With his anti-establishment approach, the biotech and vaccine sectors might see a heightened level of volatility, as investors weigh the long-term effects of Kennedy‚Äôs potential policy pivots on the healthcare landscape.

# Netflix‚Äôs Heavyweight Gamble: Tyson vs. Paul

**A Punch at Streaming‚Äôs Future**  
  
Netflix is stepping into uncharted territory¬†~~tonight~~¬†right now as it streams a high-profile boxing match between 58-year-old Mike Tyson and 27-year-old influencer Jake Paul.¬†

While the spectacle promises millions of viewers, it‚Äôs also a trial run for Netflix‚Äôs live-streaming chops ahead of broadcasting two NFL games on Christmas Day. For a platform that once dismissed live sports, this is a pivotal moment to prove it can handle the pressure‚Äîor risk being knocked out of the game.

**Betting Big on Live Events**  
  
This fight isn‚Äôt just about punches‚Äîit‚Äôs about ad dollars.

Of Netflix‚Äôs 283 million subscribers, 70 million are on the ad-supported tier, offering prime real estate for advertisers during live events. If the Tyson-Paul bout performs well, Netflix could command premium ad rates, mirroring the cable TV playbook.¬†  
  
With live NFL broadcasts already sold out, Netflix is betting on its ability to leverage sports content for future growth.

**Streaming vs. Traditional Sports Networks**  
  
The event also marks a shift in boxing‚Äôs media landscape. Once dominated by HBO and Showtime, the sport is now migrating to streaming platforms like Netflix, DAZN, and Amazon Prime.¬†

Tyson and Paul‚Äôs fight is Netflix‚Äôs way of signaling its intent to compete in live sports broadcasting, even as it diversifies with long-term deals like the WWE‚Äôs¬†*Raw*and the NFL‚Äôs holiday matchups.

**The Real Test:**¬†While the buzz around the fight is undeniable, the real winner tonight could be Netflix‚Äîor not. If the platform falters under the strain of millions of viewers, it could undermine confidence in its ability to handle future live events.¬†

But if Netflix pulls off a seamless broadcast, it will solidify its place as a new heavyweight in the live sports arena, setting up a much larger bout: its battle against traditional sports networks.

# Meta To Face Us Antitrust Trial Over Acquisitions Of Instagram and Whatsapp

Meta‚Äôs decade-old acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp are finally getting their day in court.¬†

A federal judge ruled that the FTC‚Äôs antitrust lawsuit against Meta will go to trial, alleging that the company overpaid for these platforms to eliminate competition. If the FTC wins, Meta could be forced to part ways with its prized assets, reshaping the social media landscape.¬†

However, Meta scored a minor victory with one claim‚Äîrelating to access for third-party developers‚Äîdismissed.

**Regulators Everywhere, All at Once**  
  
The hits don‚Äôt stop there for Meta. The European Union just slapped the company with an ‚Ç¨798 million ($840 million) fine, claiming Facebook Marketplace unfairly leveraged its dominance in social networking to outmuscle rivals.¬†

Meta says it‚Äôll appeal, but the penalty adds to a growing list of regulatory headaches that have investors questioning Big Tech‚Äôs resilience.

**What‚Äôs at Stake?**  
  
Meta‚Äôs empire is under siege. A breakup of Instagram and WhatsApp would mean a significant shift in its revenue streams and market power. Meanwhile, fines and lawsuits across the globe are hitting the balance sheet.¬†

For a company already navigating fierce competition from TikTok and others, the uncertainty around regulatory outcomes could stymie its future growth.

**A Global Reckoning for Big Tech**  
  
Meta isn‚Äôt alone in the hot seat. Antitrust cases against Amazon, Google, and Apple are ramping up, marking a bipartisan push to rein in tech monopolies.¬†

The stakes are high: these trials will set the tone for how governments worldwide handle Big Tech, creating ripple effects across the sector. Investors, brace yourselves‚Äîthis is just the beginning.
