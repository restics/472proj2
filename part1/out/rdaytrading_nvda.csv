While AMZ maybe Microsoft maybe still the case LT, NVDA, TSLA are down and haven‚Äôt participated.  When will NVDA really bounce back or what are your thoughts specifically on this.  Thinking of a strangle strategy here."
2023-12-17 23:02:44,TeaAdministrative421,NVDA Bullish?,"NVDA Bullish?

NVDA Bullish?

I‚Äôm thinking NVDA will either fall to around  $480 and then continue going up, or continue going up from its current point. It‚Äôs above the 20 and 50 moving average on the 4H timeframe. $480 is also close to the Daily 20 Moving average . Good for buys at or around $480 and good strike price call options, Friday expiration. Quote me üí∞"
2023-12-19 05:38:45,TearRepresentative56,I'm a professional trader and this is some of my notes on what's been happening in premarket.,"Note: I tried to take on some of the feedback from yesterdays post and provide a bit more analysis, although I keep some more back for my personal notes. Hopefully you can find value in this post though.

**What happened yesterday, and thoughts on this:**

* Yesterday, SPX and Nasdaq made marginally new highs, whilst Dow was flat. This despite fed officials continuing to try to walk back rate cut optimism.
* This move higher in SPX and Nasdaq was driven by Mag7 again, with exception of Apple and Tesla. We can see the mag7 dominance by the fact that QQQ rose by 0.43%, whilst QQQEqualweight was down for much of the day.
* Oil was higher on Red Sea disruption, particularly after BP said they would not be using the Red Sea Routes after Houthi attacks. This forces them through the Suez Canal which delays oil shipments by 2 weeks on average.
* Steel stocks pumped after Nippon Steel agree deal for X, although Senator Fetterman says he intends to try to stop the deal.
* Solar stocks notable losers as Sunpower raises doubts over its ability to continue as going concern, which dragged other Solar stocks lower.
* Vix remained suppressed around 12 which is supporting the market higher.

**My Thoughts:**

* Personally seeing signs that the market is topped out. Saw Tesla reached resistance near 260 but got rejected. NVDA now trading at 500, which I think is a psychological level that sellers will be sitting at, so would expect it to get rejected there over next few days. Apple trading near 200, which I think will be a psychological level sellers will be at. To be honest, I would have expected Apple to be down more than 0.85% with news of Apple Watch sales being paused and China accelerating their Apple ban in government institutions.
* Snapchat got a very bullish analyst upgrade but was flat on the day, which can be a sign madcaps are topping out too after a very bullish run.
* Nasdaq (IXIC, not NDX) now coming close to 15k which will see sellers sitting there.
* Other than lack of headwinds in the market in coming days in terms of data, I think market is close to key resistance levels.

**TODAY‚ÄôS DATA LEDE/MACRO EVENTS:BOJ RATES DECISION - recall from previous reddit post, my expectation was for BOJ to hold rates despite speculation of possible hike.**

* Made no change to negative interest rate, holding benchmark at -0.1%Yield curve control unchanged.
* People had speculated that they would tighten which pumped up yen. Yen to now retrace those gains.
* BOJ spoke of ‚Äúextremely high uncertainties‚Äù and said more needs to be seen to determine if ‚Äúpositive wage inflation cycle is in place‚Äù.
* Seeing gradual improvement in inflation but still not in a position to be sufficiently confident.
* Didn‚Äôt remove the rhetoric about ‚Äúwon‚Äôt hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary‚Äù. Thats quite dovish

**ANALYSIS:**BEFORE SPECULATION THAT BOJ WOULD TIGHTEN, USDJPY WAS TRADING AT 147.22JXY was trading at 68.Probably needs to retrace close to back to this.As Yen falls, Japanese equities going to become cheaper, so Nikkei will likely pump for few days now.

&#x200B;

**AUSTRALIA RBA MINUTES - For meeting where RBA went back to pausing after hiking again last month.**

* Board considered whether to raise rates by 25 bps or to keep steady. Decided on pause.
* Will continue to analyse the data to determine future policy.
* Some encouraging signs on inflation that need to continue.

**ANALYSIS**:Not much to these comments to be honest. Continued data driven rhetoric.**US** 

**BUILDING PERMITS AND HOUSING STARTS DATA COMING.**

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî FX ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* Yen lower, propping up USDJPY. USDJPY was trading at 147 before speculation of tightening. Since that didn‚Äôt materialise, USDJPY needs to retrace.
* Money rotating out of yen into other currencies like AUD, GBP etc
* Note Risk reversal on dollar index has touched lowest since 2020, and options pointing to substantial drop in USD. This would support equity markets.
* Note: Dollar and US equities are most inversely correlated since May - Can watch for some correction there.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî OPTIONS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* 4800 remains sticky strike
* Record Call skew - Bullish.
* Single Digit implied Vol
* CTAs moving supporting on Brent Crude now - algorithmic strategies supporting oil

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî MARKETS OVERVIEW ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* Markets: Flat as you would expect in premarket when they are trading at all time highs and there‚Äôs little macro catalysts to drive them notably higher right now.
* NIKKEI: Japanese stocks pumping after ultra easy monetary policy maintained for foreseeable future. Makes yen lower and Japanese equities cheaper
* GER40:Majority of sectors slightly green.
* HKG50: NOTE: I‚Äôm holding positions in the HKG50. I think it‚Äôs undervalued and people will rotate from US equities into HKG at some point.
* OIL: Flat this morning after pushing yday, although it did pare those gains when US said they will help to safeguard Red Sea vessels. Launched a task force. This reduces risk premium and made oil fall again.Yields: Flat, slightly lower

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* PIMCO SAYS THEY THINK UK WONT ACHIEVE SOFT LANDING. Said they are betting against GBP. Said UK consumers feeling brunt of interest rates more than US as less on 30 year fixed mortgages.
* MS‚Äôs MIKE WILSON SAYS US EQUITIES HAVE GREEN LIGHT TO MOVE HIGHER. - Another Bear capitulates. To be honest, I see this as a sign of market topping out too.
* GOLDMAN releases paper saying UST yields are higher in short term, but near historical averages. Bullsh\*t report really. They‚Äôre high, lets be real. Highest since 2005.
* GOLDMAN‚Äôs SENTIMENT INDICATOR TICKED UP TO 1.1. Points to stretched equity positioning. Due a correction.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Company Specific ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

Quite a flat premarket, not TOO much company specific news driving big moves. Piper Sandler put out some pieces in analyst reviews on solar sector.

* SEDG - Downgraded at Piper Snalder to neutral, price target at 105 (which is 15% above spot)
* RUN - Piper Sandler upgraded to overweight, raising price target to 31 , 72% above spot. Because RUN is more sensitive to cutting rates

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî EARNINGS REPORT ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

HEICO:Will read during the day. Is too pumped up right now and I was hoping for a correction aftermarket. Didn‚Äôt come so not an immediate priority to read before market open. Wont be buying it at these prices.I just read a short overview with summary that aerospace product demand was strong, and acquisitions helped to fuel their growth. Without acquisitions, still 12% organic sales growth though. So strong performance.

&#x200B;"
2023-12-20 05:31:43,TearRepresentative56,20/12 I'm a professional trader and these are some of my notes from premarket.,"**I want to start this post by clarifying some of my comments in yesterdays post, and responding to some of the user comments there.**

* When I said the market looks like it can be topping out, I am in no way saying I am a bear, nor am I saying I am short on the market. This is the US stock market. Obviously, in the long run, it is ultimately going to go up, and break highs. To clarify, I am still long the market. What I was saying was that barring a catalyst, which it doesn‚Äôt appear there is in the near term, I do not see a sharp move higher. I am not saying the market cannot move 0.4% higher etc day to day. It can, especially when there is nothing on the economic calendar in way of headwinds. The market is moving on optimism and can continue to move in the direction it is, especially when VIX is so suppressed. What I am saying is that if you look at the economic calendar, there‚Äôs not much this side of the new year to help push it higher forcefully.Instead, when you look at certain factors which I will break down here, it seems likely there will be some short term correction, before it again moves higher.Firstly, Mag 7 trading near resistance, which it will have to break. E.g. NVDA rejected at 500. AAPL rejected at 200. Obviously a news story can break these resistances, but trading right against them, makes it more likely for them to come down than go up.Same can be said for indices, with SPX just below all time highs, which will probably act as a resistance.
* Secondly, look at market breadth. More than 90% of stocks are trading above their 50 day Moving average. This makes sense to be honest, when you consider the rate cut optimism. But at the same time, if you look at the last 3 instances that this has happened, in each of them, the market has done short term corrections. The last time that it was able to reach a level where market breadth was at 90% and still move higher was in 2021. To be honest, I do not see enough similarities in the economic picture today to in 2021 to suggest this will happen again now. Interest rates are much higher, economic growth is slowing, consumer is holding up but there‚Äôs still uncertainty as to how long it can.
* For this reason, I see it as more likely than not that there will be short term correction before it moves higher again.
* I am still long the market. We operate a long only fund, so we never short. What we do do, is fluctuate our cash position to reflect the headwinds and tailwinds in the market, or you can say, the risk/reward in the market. Right now, I have trimmed my positions, and have closed my swing trades/active trades. I still have my passive positions all running. To this end, if the market moves higher for whatever reason, and I am proved wrong, I am happy, because my passive positions are doing well. If it price corrects, I am also happy as I can put my swing trades back in and utilise my cash position. This is what trading is all about in our strategy, using the cash position to hedge ourselves such that we benefit if the market goes up, or comes down.
* *I will now continue with the normal posts:*

**What happened yesterday, and some of my trades from yesterday:**

* Was off the desk yesterday, due to family bereavement.
* From what I can see, market continued to push higher from open. SPX is now 0.6% below all time high, whilst DJI and Nasdaq closed at all time high.Dollar was lower, whilst bond yields were flat.
* Only order I placed was for a small day trade in ARRY, entering at 18, for 2.6% gain, after its rating was cut by analyst.
* My sell order on short term trade in AVAV also executed at 130.

&#x200B;

* ***Because I was off the desk yesterday specifically, I will insert a section here on general market conditions, for those who want a bit of a summary, those who don‚Äôt can skip.***
* Market breadth continues to increase. The QQQ Equal weight, which negates the heavy weighting of the Mag 7, has moved from 52 week low to 52 week high across last month and a half.40% of stocks on the S&P are now above 70 RSI
* Goldman Sachs custom indices of unprofitable and heavily shorted stocks up 12% in last week, which tells you people are short covering and continuing to move into those stocks which have potential to run up with rate cuts.
* Discretionary stocks now at their highest level of outperformance vs Staples since January 2022.
* Put interest still very low, traders are chasing not hedging.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî EARNINGS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* FEDEX earnings: Was trading at 52 week highs going into the print, up around 20% from last earnings, which puts pressure on the earnings being good.
* EPS of 3.99 missed estimates by 5%Revenue of 22.2b was down 3% yoy, and missed estimates by 1%Express Revenue still not picked up in last 4 quarters.
* Continues to see less shipments. Package volume down YOY. Perhaps less benefit from the UPS strikes than expected. Bit disappointing.Continuing on efficiency and cost reduction program (DRIVE). Cost reductions of $1.8bTo this end, cost per packaging declined 2%, due to lower line haul expense, and better last mile productivity.Demand remains uncertainBuybacks on stock of $1b in FY 2024
* Guidance:Cut full year revenue guidance - to fall single digit %, vs previous outlook of flatEPS guidance fell short at 17.75 at midpoint, miss consensus by 3%
* Conclusion:Yes margins expanded on lower revenues to help bottom line, but operating margin still fell short of expectations. Package volume decline showed limited benefit from UPS strikesNot enough has improved at all to justify how high it is trading.
* Overall, 5/10. Not terrible, but not good enough vs where its trading. Actually cut full year guidance, vs last quarter, when stock price is 20% higher.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî DATA LEDE ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* **JAPANESE BALANCE OF TRADE DATA -** Imports fell more than expected, whilst exports were more or less flat.
* This in theory should prop up the Yen as less imports means less selling of JPY. Seems to align with when Yen started going up last night, although the move is partly price correction from yesterday‚Äôs drop.
* **UK CPI (Nov) -** As noted in my Sunday post, I expected it to come in soft in line with US, and other European peers. GBP to fall slightly.
* This proved correct, as it came in well below expectations at 3.9% vs 4.4% expected.Core also fell to 5.1% vs 5.6% expected. Lowest core reading and headline reading in more than 2 years.
* MOM move was deflationary.
* This result is good for UK economy. Whilst Bailey at last meeting was signalling higher for longer, and UK and US situations are different, this datapoint shows that UK are starting to catch US up on inflation fighting front. May see rate cuts sooner than expected in UK.GBP falls on this, as it signals BOE can maybe move more dovish than before.
* **US - Consumer Confidence (Dec)** \- After market open, so hold early trading in anticipation of this.
* **US - 20 year bond auction**. Can move bond yields which can influence markets. Likely will see decent demand which will keep bond yields lower.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî FOREX ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* GBP moves lower on soft inflation numbers, which suggests BOE may be able to be more dovish than first thought.
* Yen doing some price correction after yesterday‚Äôs move lower. Also moving higher as Japan plans to issue more government bonds in 2024, increased demand for Yen.EUR lower slightly, in sentiment with GBP
* Note: Am holding GBPUSD as I believe that the BOE will hold rates higher than the Fed. Today‚Äôs inflation surprise does bring that into question a bit, but still think BOE will be more hawkish than Fed. I had trimmed a tiny bit ahead of the inflation print, so will put that back in soon.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî MARKETS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* DJI hit new all time highs in premarket again, near 37,600 then pared gain as European markets sold off after open.
* SPX and NASDAQ similar story. Mostly flat in premarket. We expect this to continue, as barely any news catalysts around, VIX is suppressed, and GEX is very high which tells us volatility will be lower.
* GERMAN market quite flat, rejected at 16,800 today.
* UK at 3 month high following inflation data which fuelled rate cut bets.
* NIKKEI higher again on dovish BOJ yesterday as they signal ultra easy monetary to continue
* HKG50 opened higher, around 16,750 then sold off the gains, down 0.77%
* Oil moving higher by 1% in premarket. Continues higher on Red Sea complications. According to the downtrend I have drawn, which I think it will eventually break to the upside, oil is now close to the top of the downtrend, and may on a technical analysis basis do some correction here. My near term price target for oil overall is 80 though.
* Bond yields slightly lower in premarket today, which can support equities. But it‚Äôs only marginally lower so likely to have no impact.  10y lowest since July

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî OPTIONS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* GEX continues to grow - which lowers volatility4800 still sticky strike. 0dte tells us this is likely to be the max range today.HVL at 4645, 2.3% below spot.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* Didn‚Äôt read too much as was off the desk yesterday. Here‚Äôs what I did read.
* DataTrek review 30 day rolling correlations of Daily returns on SPX vs individual large cap sectors, to suggest that the current rally has around 1-2 weeks left to run. They suggested that past that, market optimism would have pushed too far too fast.
* Bank of America‚Äôs fund manger survey yesterday showed equities saw largest inflow since October 2022. Tech saw the biggest inflows, industrials saw the biggest outflows. Dont; take too much notice of this inflows/outflows news. Ultimately, Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 9 straight days of gains.
* Bank of America also put out a piece saying that although credit card delinquencies have risen sharply over the last year, households on average remain flush with liquid assets. This is something we knew as Black Friday sales showed increase in Buy now pay later.
* Societe Generale: Market finds it easier to price monetary policy impact (rate cuts) than impact of inflation trends on margins. Last year, they misplaced hikes, vs impact of inflation on profits. For 2024, could be the other way around. AKA they are saying markets are probably pricing too much cuts.
* Unicredit - ‚ÄúCurrent enthusiasm seems somewhat exaggerated from short term perspective, and setback is highly likely‚Äù. Positives are priced in.

**‚Äî‚ÄîMAG 7 NEWS ( CAN MOVE MARKETS) ‚Äî‚Äî**

* Generally flat, so the headlines outlined below are not considered big enough to have a market moving impact.
* **AAPL** \- financial impact of the smartphone ban not likely to be as severe as some first thought. Dan Ives estimates it to be about a $400m impact to sales over Holiday period. Is a drop vs their revenue.

* **LUV** \- Southwest and Pilots union reach labour deal.

* **Oil** stocks generally higher on Oil prices being up 1%
* THERE WILL BE MORE COMPANY SPECIFIC NEWS NEARER THE MARKET OPEN. THIS WAS WRITTEN A COUPLE OF HOURS BEFORE

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî OTHER HEADLINES ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* AFTER CPI DATA, UK INTEREST RATE SWAPS NOW PRICE 140bps of easing vs 117bps before CPI. Now markets beginning to price a cut by March.
* GOOLSBEE COMMENTS AFTER MARKET:Cautioned against euphoria in markets.Inflation will determine easing.What market is pricing won‚Äôt influence the Fed
* BOSTIC yday reiterated that the Fed won‚Äôt wait till 2% inflation to start cuts. Said he expects 2 cuts in 2024.

2024-01-18 12:03:37,BigBreadBreaka,Where Did I Go Wrong?,I took two shorts today on SPY. One right at open which is not normal for me( should‚Äôve waited for a range or direction to be established) but I was focused on mainly that the higher time frame was pointing towards a bearish sentiment. I was also focused on a bullish dix correlating to a bearish market from my understanding. Then I scaled down onto a lower timeframe and waited for a fair value gap for my entry. Immediately after both trades I got stopped out before reversing down in which I would have hit my targeted take profit. From my understanding I should have maybe waited for a better entry and been more patient but from what I saw there wasn‚Äôt any better entry setups above my targeted entry. So where did I go wrong on this trade?

Puts are the absolute worst way to make money, it is extremely difficult if you don‚Äôt time your puts correctly, I have closed my eyes and randomly bought calls and made profit multiple time. No strategy required just buy calls when SPY or QQQ goes down and it always bounces, works best with 0dte 

I have bought puts at the top overbought levels and it just keeps pumping away, I have never seen SPY goes down and not have a bounce, calls = free money

TLDR fuck put options

Sorry for the angry rant

Edit: Today was a PERFECT example of what I‚Äôm talking about, it was going up with ZERO pullbacks, anywhere you got puts you would get your head taken off unless you timed your puts perfectly and took profits immediately, I‚Äôve never seen SPY goes down the same way without some sort of bounce before going back down even during the 2022 bear market

Just go on Stocktwits and see how many blew up their account buying puts on QQQ NVDA

2024-01-26 08:33:07,Honest-Debate-6863,NVDA free fall until $570,"The gamma is too low and below static levels 


Valuation disconnected from reality: Some analysts believe that the company's valuation is disconnected from its actual performance, which could be causing the stock to drop

 U.S. export controls: New U.S. export controls on advanced technology to China have led to concerns about the impact on Nvidia's sales and revenue. The company has already completed its scheduled deliveries to China for 2023, but the new restrictions could cause a ""permanent"" loss of opportunities for U.S. businesses in China

 Revenue guidance: Nvidia increased its fourth-quarter revenue guidance to $20 billion, but there was a ""whisper number"" on Wall Street that the company might miss its revenue targets. This slight misstep in revenue guidance, combined with U.S. export controls, could be contributing to the stock's decline

 Insider trading concerns: Some investors have expressed concerns about insider trading activities, which could be affecting the stock's performance"

2024-02-20 21:25:12,AlgoTradingQuant,NVDA Earnings and Predictions üöÄ,"Every time my algo trading bots have identified a short against NVDA this year, 61.83% of those trades were losers.  At this point, I‚Äôm considering just buying and holding this stock for a few months because I have completely disabled my bots from day trading NVDA.  

My prediction as of today 2/20/2024 is that NVDA will pop tomorrow (especially in the afternoon) and NVDA will absolutely crush analysts estimates tomorrow evening.  I also anticipate them providing an extremely positive guidance/outlook and suspect we will see extreme volatility near and after the closing bell tomorrow.  I‚Äôd also like to see NVDA announce a major acquisition and/or partnership.

Just my .02 as I am not a financial professional.  YMMV"
2024-02-21 07:22:13,tradingpoker,Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings play and caution for later.,"The charts below are NVDA 1 minute when earnings were released last time (21st¬†November 2023) As you can see, it's a violent move and a pure gamble if you are in beforehand, IMO.¬† 

The second chart is the NVDA 5-minute chart, on the day of earnings. I am predicting an inside-ish day on NVDA, which could be great for scalpers/day traders.¬† 

I will avoid the earnings release, as that's gambling IMO. But I will look to trade a smaller size once it settles after hours.¬†

Levels-wise, I will be watching the $750 on the upside; after that, we have no levels to look at. Downside $670

These losses were mostly due to my poor judgment when it came to earning announcements for certain companies.

Monday- 1 $NVDA 800c (SL on Tuesday at -$1.2k loss)

Tuesday- 8 $SOUN 8C (SL tdy at a -$736 loss)

2024-03-04 08:25:23,GetEdgeful,üìà $NVDA fills the gap 89% of the time ON THIS WEEKDAY,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ew0idst45cmc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d34f82b3f251d6e6698cc6695d269f48cab58362

this report pulls data on $NVDA's gap fill tendencies by weekday for the past year.

what I found was that on Monday's, $NVDA has a strong tendency to fill the gap - regardless of whether the stock gaps up or gaps down.

for the past year, when $NVDA has gapped down (meaning today's opening price was lower than yesterday's opening price) the gap has filled 89% of the time, and when $NVDA has gapped up (meaning today's opening price was higher than yesterday's opening price) the gap has filled 78% of the time.

you can use this to estimate how price action today will move relative to yesterday."

this report shows how often $NVDA has touched its previous week's high and low in the past 3 months. this report only considers the current trading week and the week prior - that's it.

what I found was that 85.71% of the time, NVDA has touched last week's high at some point during the week, and only touched last week's low 21.43% of the time.

based on this, we see that highs most frequently get touched and that price is trending upwards. you can use this to take trades targeting last week's highs."

I definitely could‚Äôve made much more, but I exited all my positions pretty quickly since I was scared of running my account back down again.

this report looks at NVDA's price action on Friday's to see how often price broke out, broke down, didn't break or broke both out and down of the opening 15 minute range in the past 6 months.

what I found was that on Friday's during this period, price never broke both out and down of the 15 minute opening range, nor did it ever stay within it. 

based on the data, I found that price tended to break out (meaning price broke above the opening range first) 65.39% of the time, and only broke down (meaning price broke below the opening range first) 34.62% of the time.

you can use this to estimate how price will move on Friday's after market open."

this report looks at NVDA's price action for the past 6 months to see how often gaps up on Mondays fill and how often gaps down on Monday fill.

for context: a gap up is when a stock's opening price is higher than yesterday's closing price and a gap down is when a stock's opening price is lower than yesterday's closing price.

what I found was that for the past 6 months, if a stock has gapped down on a Monday, it has retouched Friday's closing price 75% of the time. 

use this when building your next trading strategy to make sure you're trading with the trend and not against it."

2024-03-21 17:16:12,T1m3Wizard,Started trading 5 years ago with 36k after saving up from my first job out of college. These are the lessons I learned along the way (in no particular order) that I hope can benefit other aspiring traders.,"Preface: I only funded this account with the starting capital of 36k and had never added to it. This was supposed to be my go ham with real money live trading account so I can feel the real emotions involved instead of a painless simulated trading experience/practice (probably not recommended). Perhaps I got lucky but I am surprised it survived as well and grew so steadily. This account has evolved from buying and holding to day trading stocks and options, and is currently in the premium selling phase for the last 3.5 years. Methods changed and evolved but the below is true and should remain consistent as you still need to analyze the chart before jumping in.

I decided to do a write up in hopes of helping others because I asked a question the other day since I started using my broker's mobile app and was perplexed about the way it displayed it's margin balance and boy did I get chewed up üòÑ. To be fair there were some helpful comments but it was extremely rare. I don't want others to be discouraged and think this sub is unhelpful to hopefully someone finds these suggestions helpful. Here were my list two posts and the comments I received if you are curious: [Why is my margin balance showing -46k?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1bj0cf3/am_i_overleveraged_my_options_margin_available_is/) / [Positions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1bjtarx/i_was_told_to_post_my_positions_here_after_asking/)

1. Psychology plays a big role.
2. Don't trade with money you can't afford to lose.
3. Trade with the trend.
4. Pick stocks with relative strength or relative weakness.
5. You can measure a stock's RSRW against SPY and/or it's sector.
6. There is a STEEP learning curve.
7. Journal and review your trades.
8. Although Indicators are subjective, if there are enough people watching or using it, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy so always be mindful of where buyers and sellers are eyeing.
9. If a stock is strongly supported or sold off at one area or price point, it will most likely create a temporary top or bottom as buyers/sellers were rewarded there once before so you can expect them to react the same way. 
10. Unless you're yolo'ing or gambling, don't trade around earnings or any major news event as these can create a catalyst and are very unpredictable.
11. Gaps tend to be filled.
12. Day 2 and plus continuation is a real thing if there is a strong enough catalyst (e.g. gap and go)
13. Institutions move markets.
14. Volume is important.
15. Don't chase loses.
16. IV is high for a reason.
17. Know your greeks if are going to trade options.
18. Use a top down approach such as multi time frame analysis  and start with the higher time frames.
19. Buy and hold trumps all (unpopular opinion for day traders but it's true).
20. Try not to trade during the first and last 30 to 60 mins of market open/close. 
21. There are opportunities throughout the day 
22. Know and develop your own trading style and do what works best for you.
23. Risk management is important but I do not follow the regurgitated 1% rule (it's regarded if you have enough buying power and margin at your disposal).
24. Use margin wisely.
25. Learn to adapt to different market conditions.
26. What has worked in the past might now work in the future if macro economics changed.
27. Never stop learning. 
28. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

That's it for now mainly because I'm tired and don't want to type anymore, I'm sure there's more. Will come back later and add to the list perhaps. Good luck everyone!"

this report pulls price action on NVDA for the past 6 months to look at how often price touches the previous week's high, the previous week's low and both the previous week's high and low as well as how often it stays within the range.

what I found was that on average, NVDA has touched its previous week's high 68% of the time and only touched its previous week's low, 32% of the time. 

if you see that price has a tendency to touch last week's high - which in this case it does - you can use this to set targets around that price. 

on the contrary, if you see that price doesn't tend to touch the previous week's low - which is the case here - don't aim to set targets around that price. "

this report pulls price action data on NVDA for the past year to see which weekday the weekly high tends to fall on and which weekday the weekly low tends to fall on. 

what I found was that in the past year, Friday's often record the week's highs (38% of the time), whereas, Monday's generally record the week's lows (33% of the time). 

this might make Monday's a good buying opportunity, aiming to benefit from a rise after the trough.

2024-05-19 14:43:14,saadalvi10,What stocks are you currently trading? Which ones have the most volatility? ,I usually trade NVDA or MSTR. I was wondering what everyone is using for their stock of choice?  
2024-05-22 05:03:19,TearRepresentative56,"I'm a full time trader and this is my total pre market cheat sheet, including positioning analysis on US markets, NVDA, TSLA and FX. ","ANALYSIS:

Overall US Market:

* SPX Skew is elevated, traders remain bullish. Skew points slightly down, but this is hedging ahead of FOMC. Traders selling some calls but its v low volume.¬†
* Note: positioning and trader sentiment around NVDA remains bullish.¬†
* Because of this positive expectation around NVDA, traders are buying calls on QQQ. Traders expect Nasdaq rot continue to go higher.¬†
* So we do see some disparity there in what traders are doing. They are more bullish on tech right now ahead of NVDA.¬†
* Momentum continues to show stronger buyers, we are at ATH on both QQQ and SPX.¬†
* MSFT and NFLX both hit new highs yesterday.¬†
* VIX liquidity continues to be very low, whilst liquidity in equities is increasing. The fact that VIX liquidity is very low is a sign that traders have no real fear in the market. Bulls v comfortable right now.

On FX & metals:

* As mentioned in other post, GBPUSD positioning bullish, particularly after CPI came hotter than expected. Short term and long term we see skew point up. 1.28 target. on EURUSD, skew points higher but price is stuck below 1.085 for now. 1.08 is clear support, traders target 1.09, even calls on 1.10.
* On Gold and Silver, we can see a slight pullback or flattening whilst traders wait to see more volume. V low volume but mostly traders selling their calls now and buying puts. Still low volumes though so not expecting big moves. But also not seeing big move higher yet.

Key stocks for focus:

* **NVDA: skew is flattish this week but pointing higher. Traders will be looking for 1000 if earnings come in in line. More if stock split. A lot of calls around there. As a result of NVDA earnings looking higher, SMCI higher too. Other semis in general quite bullish on hopeful expectations for NVDA.**
* **TSLA: Got bit of a jump yday as skew pointed higher and we got good news to support. Gamma is mostly between 180-190. Can see move to 190 if NVDA supports, but beyond that not much OTM call gamma. Positioning iTM is strong but not seeing move higher. More likely possible rejection from 100D MA.**



DATA LEDE:

* UK CPI: Headline came out 2.3% vs 2.1% expected. Still down a lot on the 3.2% last month. Hot, but not that bad.¬†
* But if we look under the hood, we see that there are areas of the UK inflation that are heating up.¬†
* Core CPI came 3.9% vs 3.6% expected. Only down slightly from 4.2%
* And if we look at Services in particular, we see Services inflation at 5.9%, much hotter than the 5.4% expected and more or less sticky to last month.
* BOE have been more dovish/neutral recently
* This increases risk of moving more hawkish again.¬†
* Now traders see just 38bps of rate cuts in 2024 after the data, much less than before.¬†
* RBNZ hawkish pause.¬†
* FOMC minutes later.¬†



MARKETS:

* SPX: Flat at 5317. Bounced off high of 5325 again, same as last couple of days.¬† Market will likely remain flat ahead of NVDA earnings and FOMC. WAS A RECORD CLOSE YDAY
* NDX: At record highs. 18,730. 1.5% away from 19k, so can be in view if nVDA earnings come good
* Dow: Flat just under 40k
* GER40: Slightly lower this morning, all just normal profit taking and hedging at these highs, positioning remains bullish.¬†
* HKG50: Flat at 19,202 today, absolutely flat
* OIL: slightly lwoer again. Mostly flat around 78. Was rejected at 80 WTI
* Gold slightly lower today, at 2413. Support still 2400.¬†



FX:

* USD moving slightly higher again, paring some of the post CPI losses.¬† With this, USDJPY continues higher, as yen remains weak after failed intervention. Failed to break 152, hence moving higher.¬†
* EURUSD stuck just under 1.285, bullish positioning. ¬†
* GBPUSD at 1.272. Target looks like 1.28 especially given CPI hot.¬†

Stopped and went to the gym and told myself no touchy. Be happy with your profits. Don‚Äôt overtrade. 

Well, I decided to start in on some $NVDA puts after the 1200 break out. I took more size than I should have. I got smoked. 
I gave back all gains and ended the day -1,400.

Then I had the smart idea to take 2 option contracts of $NVDA 1250 puts expiring June 14 at $58.00. 

Well. I‚Äôm starting in the hole tomorrow on these most likely over 1,000 I‚Äôd guess probably closer to -2,000.  

My +2,000 day will now be a -3,500 day because I‚Äôm a fucking idiot. So pissed. So upset with myself. Despair. Maybe this isn‚Äôt for me if I can control my overtrading. "
2024-06-05 17:11:12,Lavanger,"Made 30%, could have made 300%. How do you guys deal with profit taking?","Alright hear me out, I been planning this week since Sunday night, watch some news, what to expect from the week, take some notes, put some stocks on my watch list, set up ranges, look up a an economic calendar and see what catalyst we have this week etc. 

Well this week for all you regards it's all around PMI reports and Job reports, sure some foreign banks playing with interest rates, but we don't care about that really, unless you trade Futures or Forex (I don't), I trade US equities we don't care about ECB lowering rates. Earnings season almost over, and although weak, not bad. 

Monday and Tuesday reports pointing to a weak report on Friday, and today was like a confirmation, NVDA doing split on Friday, perfect, we go long. Without even looking at charts, just the ADP report I knew we were in for a 2% day movement. 


Well it's 9:45 and QQQ is already up 1%... should I go long, I mean it's already high enough..

Well, of course, like I said trend days like this tend to be 2% days on average. (For QQQ)

I see it starts a breakout I go long as soon as it starts, no fear.  
I buy 20 contracts, 0dte QQQ. 

Long story short, I sold at 1.25% lol , made $620 instead of $6200. 

Obviously I was checking the chart every 2 minutes after I sold and was pissed I myself, now I am more calm because nobody goes broke taking profit, and I know I did good...
But this is something that always happens to me, I sell and I keep looking at the charts. Only time I'm happy is when I sell for a loss and then it dips further, I'm relived lol

But we all know that's not good, if you put emotions you end up taking more trades etc. How do you guys deal with it? any recommendations? 
Trust me I close the chart only to open it every 5 minutes."

I have now turned the tides today and am up just under +5,000 on NVDA today. 
I left for the gym now and am going to try to not trade anymore today. Keep my profits. 
The FOMO in NVDA is here though with it sitting at 1200 on this big gap down going into tomorrow last day before split takes effect. 

If anyone sees me open my computer or trading platform today please slap me and tell my wife."

Not even a couple months later NVDA started sky rocketing and carrying the 2024 market (Currently at 1200). Fast forward to last Friday I got GME at $23.03 a share with 43 shares. The following Monday GameStop rose to $38 a share so I coulda sold Monday morning and made an extra 700. But since I slept in I ended up selling for $280 profit. Now GME is at $55, excluding the profit I sold it for I fumbled 800 today. Now I feel like shit why do I keep doing this to myself how do I prevent this? It‚Äôs really eating at me I feel absolutely dead. I know these might be rookie numbers for some people but I‚Äôm 17 and my account is valued at 1300 with these GME shares I could have made my profit goal for the entire summer (which was to double my account). Long story short I missed 3 opportunities to double my account to around 2000 one on NVDA and twice in one week on GME how do I stop being an idiot? How can I prevent this in the future?

I get it‚Äôs part of trading and I need to turn off my emotions but I need actual advice I just feel really dead inside and stupid "
2024-06-11 20:09:30,Outrageous_Bid5910,Thoughts on nvda,"### High Demand for NVIDIA's GPUs

#### Key Drivers of Demand

1. **Product Development and Computational Tasks**:
   - **Chatbots and AI**: Companies use GPUs to power AI models for chatbots, virtual assistants, and other natural language processing (NLP) applications. The computational power of GPUs is essential for training and running these models efficiently.
   - **Scientific Research**: High-performance computing (HPC) tasks in scientific research, such as simulations and data analysis, heavily rely on GPUs for their parallel processing capabilities.

2. **Self-Driving Technology**:
   - **Autonomous Vehicles**: GPUs are critical in processing the vast amounts of data from sensors and cameras in real-time to make decisions for self-driving cars. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and others invest heavily in GPU technology for their autonomous vehicle programs.

3. **Robotics**:
   - **Industrial Automation**: Robotics in manufacturing and logistics use GPUs to handle complex tasks, including real-time image recognition, object manipulation, and path planning.
   - **Service Robots**: From healthcare to hospitality, service robots rely on GPU-powered AI to interact with humans and perform tasks autonomously.

4. **Race Towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**:
   - **Major Tech Companies**: Companies like Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft are in a race to develop AGI. This requires building and training extremely large neural networks, which demand substantial computational resources provided by GPUs.
   - **Market Advantage**: The first company to achieve AGI could gain a significant market advantage, driving intense competition and further increasing the demand for high-performance GPUs.

### Implications for NVIDIA

#### Market Position

- **Leadership in GPU Technology**: NVIDIA is a leader in the GPU market, known for its continuous innovation and high-performance products. This positions NVIDIA well to meet the growing demand across various sectors.
- **R&D Investment**: NVIDIA‚Äôs investment in research and development ensures it stays ahead of competitors and continues to deliver cutting-edge GPU solutions.

#### Potential for Growth

- **Revenue Increase**: The diverse and expanding applications of GPUs suggest sustained and potentially increasing revenue streams for NVIDIA.
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Collaborations with tech giants, automotive companies, and research institutions can further boost NVIDIA‚Äôs market presence and revenue.

### Considerations and Risks

1. **Supply Chain Constraints**:
   - **Manufacturing Capacity**: Meeting the high demand may strain NVIDIA‚Äôs manufacturing capacity, potentially leading to supply shortages and increased prices.
   - **Component Shortages**: Global semiconductor shortages can impact the production of GPUs, affecting supply and pricing.

2. **Competitive Landscape**:
   - **Rival Technologies**: Competitors like AMD and Intel are also advancing their GPU technologies, which could impact NVIDIA‚Äôs market share.
   - **New Entrants**: Emerging companies in the AI and semiconductor space might introduce innovative products, increasing competition.

3. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**:
   - **AI Regulations**: As governments develop regulations around AI and autonomous systems, compliance could affect development timelines and costs.
   - **Ethical Implications**: The race towards AGI raises ethical concerns, including safety, job displacement, and privacy issues, which could lead to public and regulatory scrutiny.

### Investment Perspective

Given the diverse applications and high demand for GPUs, particularly NVIDIA's products, the company is well-positioned for significant growth. However, potential investors should consider the risks associated with supply chain constraints, competition, and regulatory changes. A balanced investment strategy, possibly including a diversified portfolio of tech stocks, can help mitigate these risks while capitalizing on the growth potential in the GPU market."
2024-06-16 17:23:11,p8q8,$NVDA Optimal Trades for Friday,
2024-06-18 18:11:55,Elmksan,What makes a good day trader,"Hi everyone. I've had a RH account for about 4 years now. Over those 4 years I've turned about a thousand dollars into 20,000. Though I frequent WSB, I don't take insane gambles. I usually watch for dips on companies I'm bullish on then buy a long call and am happy to sell it when it reaches a 30 or 40 percent return (and have had a fair share of 200-300+ percent returns). Also have the toughness to suck it up and sell at a loss when the prospects don't look good. It's been consistent for me. I very much wanted to buy NVDA long calls in 2022 but didn't have the money. Very much wanted to buy thousands in Celsius stock when it was a dollar or so. Again, no cash. Could have had a small fortune (for me at least).

The past few days have been different. After a lot of research and gauging the general zeitgeist, I put a lot of money into NVDA, TSM, and ARM calls in the past few weeks and months. Also some AMD awhile back and some Apple. All were options, also with a few thousand dollars in fractional shares of stuff like SMCI, MSFT, and semiconductor and AI ETFs. Long story short, this all came together to give me a 3,200 dollar gain today. I made more money in a few hours than I've made working a regular job in 2 months (Ivy League degree, but I work in education, so I get paid shit despite the fancy degree).

My question is: am I deluding myself into thinking I may be good at this? I feel strongly that I have the emotional intelligence and risk management skills required to day trade. I don't have any fancy technical tools; mostly just look at basic performance charts, P/E ratios, etc. and read a variety of articles from reputable sources. I think I certainly have the capacity though to learn some more sophisticated analytical tools (fairly strong background in math and logic as well a fair amount of exposure to software, coding, etc.).

Should I consider getting into day trading and devoting more time to it, even making it full time? If so, what's my next step? Currently sitting at 22k in my RH account (5K available in margin), as well as a few thousand in Fidelity (all AMAT; another bet I made 6 years ago that's given a huge return).

tl;dr : I've 20+xed my Robinhood investment of 1,000 bucks in 4 years, mostly through bullish long options. Should I consider getting into day trading more seriously?"
2024-06-20 13:33:42,Klaus_Winchester,Lost nearly 8k day trading today,I messed up big time today. This was a loan from my parents too.  I‚Äôm such an idiot I bought NVDA and VRT at the high and kept holding thinking it would bounce back up. But the dang stocks kept dropping today. Finally flattened for an 8k loss. Worked my way back up to -6.5k and now ended day at -7.4k.  Just ranting here.  Please tell me how tomorrow will be since I need to make this money back.  I‚Äôm not gonna be able to sleep till I make it all back.

I was thinking about this question a lot lately. The question is kinda hypothetical but I'm pretty sure many of you trade only a single ticker.

So if you had to pick only one what would it be and why?

Let me know what you think! Thanks!"
2024-07-05 15:12:03,MiserableAd5608,Solid week with NVDA options,"I strung together 4 great days and got a little lucky too. I generally only trade the SPY but NVDA has been ripe for scalping this week 

  I finally started automating my stop losses instead of doing it manually, and moved them up as profits increased. This really let the winners run moreso than when I am in control of the stops ( I take profit too early)

I gave back about $15k trying to increase my green days this week, but no risk, no reward. I generally increase my buy-size if I'm up for the day by more than I expected.  Today, I was up $8k by 10am, and ended up only profiting $1100. I made many consecutive bad trades but finally hit my stride around noon

Trade-on!

Do you only trade one ticker?  Or mostly trade one? 

Any advice for someone just starting out watching one ticker?  SPY specific advice?

I had no experience day trading beforehand, but I talked to a friend who was experienced in the art of trading and he taught me a couple of indicators and gave me a book to read, which I think helped tremendously as I learned that not being a smartass and trying to outsmart the market by going against trends/predicting reversals.

2024-08-17 18:48:10,daytradelife1,The Unfiltered Truth About Day Trading Realities,"Day trading. The thrill of making quick profits, the freedom to work from anywhere, and the potential to live a life of luxury. It's an enticing prospect, and many of us have been drawn to its promise.

Many people think day trading is a get-rich-quick scheme, where you simply jump into the market, make a few trades, and voil√†, you're a millionaire. Others believe it's a thrilling lifestyle, where you're always on the edge of your seat, making bold moves, and reaping massive rewards. But let's be real, most of these perceptions are fueled by social media and Hollywood movies. The reality is far from glamorous.

In reality, day trading is a tough business. The failure rates are staggering, with some estimates suggesting that up to 90% of new traders lose their entire trading account within the first few months. Yes, you heard that right ‚Äì 90%! And it's not because they're stupid or lazy; it's because they're unprepared, naive, or simply don't have the right mindset.

The truth is, day trading is a skill that requires dedication, hard work, and a deep understanding of the markets. It's not a hobby or a side hustle; it's a full-time job that demands your attention, discipline, and patience. And even then, there are no guarantees of success.

Let's talk about the realities of day trading. Market volatility is a constant threat, and even the best traders in the world can't predict what will happen next. Emotional discipline is crucial, because one impulsive decision can wipe out your entire account. And education ‚Äì oh, education is key. You need to have a deep understanding of technical analysis, fundamental analysis, risk management, and trading psychology.

But even with all these factors in place, day trading is a game of probability. You can do everything right and still lose. You can follow the best strategies, use the best tools, and still end up in the red. That's just the nature of the beast.

So, what's the key to success in day trading? Is it magic? Is it luck? No, it's actually quite simple. It's about understanding that day trading is a marathon, not a sprint. It's about being consistent, patient, and persistent. It's about adapting to changing market conditions, learning from your mistakes, and constantly improving your craft.

The average trader's experience is a rollercoaster of emotions, with moments of euphoria followed by periods of despair. They're constantly chasing the next big trade, the next big win, without realizing that consistency is the key to long-term success. They're like gamblers, always looking for the next fix, the next rush of adrenaline.

But the few who achieve consistent success ‚Äì they're a different breed altogether. They're the ones who understand the importance of discipline, risk management, and education. They're the ones who take the time to develop a solid trading plan, to backtest their strategies, and to refine their skills.

In conclusion, the allure of day trading is real, but the realities are harsh. It's not a game for the faint of heart, and it's certainly not a get-rich-quick scheme. If you're thinking of becoming a day trader, you need to have realistic expectations, a solid understanding of the markets, and a deep commitment to your craft.

2024-09-14 09:35:54,Content_Substance943,Momo Strat For $NVDA,"Fwiw....

  
Backtested a momentum strat for NVDA over the last 30 market sessions. 100% mechanical. No nuance. It was either take 100% profit or 100% loss. No ema, no vwap, no magic. Just used 2 day prior range and %'s.  

  
The R/R was: 1.67 , win was 25% of 2 day prior range, loss was 15% of prior 2 day range. 

  
The strategy: Take hi/low range for last two market sessions combined (I used daily hi/lo indicator on ToS.) Using total prior 2 day range, the play started when price hit the 25% mark in either direction. It is a momentum play, so when price went down 25% of prior 2 day range, it triggered a short  and vice versa. If price momentum stalled and reversed, the stop was at the 10% mark. Take profit was price continuing on to hit the 50% mark. So a loss was 15% of prior 2 day range and a win was 25% of prior 2 day range. 

  
Totals: 

11 LOSSES for a Total of 1547 cents (Average loser was 140 cents)

17 WINS for a Total of 3637 cents (Average winner was 214 cents) 

3 plays were flat ending the day near the trigger bar. "

This was more than 2 weeks of trading I put in to make that kind of money, pissed off I bought 50 calls of NVDA deep ITM in hopes to make it all back and break even.

I saw myself down -$10,000 unrealized losses, I didn't sell, I was getting prepared for the possibility of wiping everything out the whole $60,000 I had in the calls. The unrealized loss got smaller as the price went back up.

Eventually I was able to close it out with just +$100 profit, but look at what it took! I felt like vomiting and this isn't an exaggeration. $10,000 is a LOT of money to me, what is wrong with me, it looks like I have a gambling addiction of some sort.

And I am still up overall, and made profit end of the year, but I have had a habit of forcing trades, revenge trading, and gambling my weekly gains.

I have a really bad feeling one of these days if I keep this up my luck will eventually run out, and I need to stop doing this not for the sake of my money but for my own mental health. I never had anything raise my heart rate like that without any physical activity. I hated myself for doing this, but relieved I got out without a scratch."

11 days doesn't seem like enough data to go off of, but I can almost guarantee myself I can make $50 a day trading no problems. but of course $339.40 is almost 7x that amount, but I do have $30,000 more in my account than I had last year.

\[UPDATE\]: DAY 13, my average decreased and is now at $299.86 per day when taking all the gains made from the past 13 trading days and dividing it by 13. As expected the value is decreasing.

No divergences were spotted here, but as most of you know I also look at the 200ma and VWAP, (PINK AND BLUE LINE). If I see price test but not break below one or two of those, I will typically enter when I see a buy or bullish signal. This is one of my favorite strategies to use simply because it‚Äôs simple. 

Was simply the move today, and it worked out like I needed it to. Who here thinks $SPY hits $580 this week? Lot of factors to consider, CPI, Minutes, etc‚Ä¶ I think if we break ATH we have a real chance to explode. We shall see.

Do any of you do the same? What timeframes do you look at? I have found this to be very effective especially 30-45 mins after market open on lower timeframe charts. (2,3,4m)

Swing trade vs Day Trading + Hold Overnight Since October 14th Open to October 30 close - NVDA:

Swing % up unrealized 2.06%.                                                   

Day Trade % up realized 20.21%


Long time investor, swing trader, and day trader. I've been doing all three for a while and my girlfriend, who's a swing trader, used to tell me day trading was a Fool's Errand until she saw how profitable I am. One of the ways I illustrated this to her was to compete with her over a period of time as she swing traded stock and I day traded the same stock. As it turned out, day trading was an order of magnitude better at reaping profits than swing trading. The exercise prompted me to experiment with day trading in slightly different ways to figure out profitable, easy ways to day trade and make profits. 

Here's what I've learned about stocks over the years. 

1. Almost all stocks of healthy companies and, especially ETF's (which cycle out bad stock and cycle in good stocks periodically),  trend net upward over time. Sure they go up and down, but overall they go up. 

2. Almost all stock and ETF's make their real gains overnight. [https://www.ccn.com/the-stock-markets-biggest-gains-always-happen-at-the-same-time-each-day/](https://www.ccn.com/the-stock-markets-biggest-gains-always-happen-at-the-same-time-each-day/)

3. Although most gains are made overnight, stock prices swing considerably, up and down, during the intraday. 

4. The markets intraday have repeating patterns. [https://tradethatswing.com/stock-market-intraday-repeating-patterns/](https://tradethatswing.com/stock-market-intraday-repeating-patterns/)

5. The markets also have annual patterns. [https://tradethatswing.com/seasonal-patterns-of-the-stock-market/](https://tradethatswing.com/seasonal-patterns-of-the-stock-market/)

6. Stock with Buy and Strong Buy analyst ratings that are below their price targets tend to trade upward toward that target much more often than not.

Knowing all this, we can infer a trading strategy: 

Find a good stock with lots of upside, high volume, strong buy ratings from analysts, and average analyst price targets above the stocks current price and day trade it aggressively without a stop loss during up trending seasons and hold the stock overnight, every night (well, almost every night). Then, never hold it when a down trending season is approaching.

Take NVDA for example, which has increased 227% over the past year. If you day traded and held NVDA overnight, you'd have made considerably more than 227%. If you consider seasonal downturns which occur mainly in February, June, and September and you day trade without holding the stock overnight and accept any intraday loss - but try to avoid them - you'd make even more $$.

https://preview.redd.it/8zbntxysskvd1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c16ae98b361ef74c7bc126c989a58a93c16a7cc

Anyway, I decided to quantify and collect evidence starting this week and I will continue for this Q4 up trending season. All U.S. markets have their best gains in Q4 from roughly the end of October to the end of December. Often, though, the market continues to make gains until March with a dip in February. 

This week NVDA from Monday open to Friday's close gained -.01%. However, if you day traded NVDA as I did you would have made $$ instead of losing it like a swing trader or long term investor. Look at all those ups and downs on the NVDA chart for this week! Perfectly ripe for Day Trade pickin'!

https://preview.redd.it/mv82q8k3ukvd1.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa926cbdb63efe7f23aff5d2202c3c359082cb60

So, I day traded and held NVDA every night this week and am still holding it. Instead of losing -.01%, I earned over $900. I also day traded a lot of other stock for more profit than just $900, but this is what I earned from NVDA. I'll be continuing this probably until NVDA announced earnings in March 2025.

https://preview.redd.it/8f1hqy7pukvd1.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3862943df5ed00ad5eb402251843e66924e93fb

Day trading is much more profitable than swing trading and long term investing. I often day trade and hold overnight during up trending seasons for the reasons illustrated above. Oh, yeah, I also do not use stop losses. So, F your stop loss.

2024-10-22 09:54:43,theonlyretard,Caught Monday's Entire 4% NVDA Rally Using Dark Pool Orders ,"https://preview.redd.it/bjf2mf1u7cwd1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=204a8e052bed0e60a08840dffddbb08b0a5ed4f3

Played NVDA yesterday and caught the whole rally from open to close using dark pools transactions. You had a massive transaction come in on the dark pool tape at close on Friday at $138. You also had a transaction from Thursday at 139.16 that had not touched yet aside from when the initial order came in. 

  
The following Monday I looked at the stock and noticed that it had been moving premarket around $138 and placed an order premarket for the NVDA 149C 10/25 Expiration at 0.20. The order didn't fill at open, so I moved the order to .22 where I filled and took the option all the way up to as high as 0.90.

  
This is a screenshot of my position while I was in it yesterday.

2024-10-25 21:37:18,Gigantic_Elephant,"I built an AI that reads 10,000+ news every morning for your portfolio. Check it out folks!","Hi y'all! I am a college student studying Computer Science and finance.

Three month ago, I came across the idea of building an AI that can go through all news that were published within the last 24 hours and select the ones about my investment portfolios, so that I don't have to spend lots of times scrolling news apps or websites to research what happened in the world or in the market that I genuinely care.

Now, I successfully built it!

**Here is what it does**: every morning, it reads from 50+ reputable sources (around 10,000+ news). Then, based on user's chosen stock in their watchlist, my NewsGPT analyzes all news with its understanding regarding the stock and select the ones that have impact on the stocks. Every morning, it will generate a news summary and send it to the user through email.

Please check it out \[[www.dinodigest.news](https://www.dinodigest.news/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic_social)\] if you're interested in being my early-stage user (**it's free forever!**). I'm happy to answer any further questions regarding this NewsGPT or how I built it. Of course, if you don't like it, roast me hard and I'll fire back (evil face).

Thanks a lot everyone!!!

2024-11-01 08:09:20,Rennat91,How can I improve this? ,Bought on finger one. Sold on finger two. I bought when volume was heading up. Figured I better cut my loss so I did and came back later and could‚Äôve gained on my position. Should I wait to see after the second green candle instead of buying the second green candle?
2024-11-01 11:25:45,crystal_castle00,Share your premarket gameplan for NVDA Friday 11/01?,"I was heavily short biased and heavily mistaken. It turned out to be the worst short of the day. Luckily i adapted quickly and closed my day at b/e but I'd really like to know how you guys read the setup.

Please share your thesis with me.

My short bias was primarily driven by the daily breakdown from consolidation and the 5min chart showing topping action in premarket (same on 60min) - I was looking for a continuation move to the downside. Also camarilla pivots were setting up nicely for an R4/R3 short."
2024-11-06 10:30:50,Dangerous-Time-7819,I have a capital of $100. How do I trade/enter & Should I risk around 5% on stocks like these?,"My scanner runs for stocks <$20, relative volume pretty high, and >10% change. Although I faced a problem attempting to trade those stocks; The market is either very sideways, unpredictable, gains/loses slowly. (I‚Äôm aware that‚Äôs how 80% of the stocks work)

So, the question is as a very small account beginner, should I take the trade on these types of stocks or pass them and find very volatile penny stocks with an uptrend as I only have a strategy for this condition?

And if You were to take those trades, how would you go about doing so? I‚Äôm trying to expand my strategy on entries for these specific type of stocks but have no clue how.

Am I being too ambitious? Unrealistic? Thanks guys."

See what one deviation from standard practices and rule can do.

The day started, I had no patience for anything, I felt invincible and as opposed to trading SPY like I normally do, or better yet, recognize and act on the fact that I wasn‚Äôt feeling it that day, my brain manipulated me into NVDA after it broke resistance, as opposed to my edge, of waiting for the retest to jump in, but NVDA would not slow down here, wouldn‚Äôt it? 

Well, guess what‚Ä¶ it retested and broke down, I kept averaging down (another red flag) and kept on holding until I gave up and closed the trade.

That day, was Oct 7, 2024, another financially painful lesson in the world of trading.

Believe it not, I actually ended the day feeling great, realizing that it‚Äôs a great opportunity to re-prove myself that the edge I have isn‚Äôt a fruit of my imagination.

The day after I got back on the horse, utilizing my regular system which proved great results in a more aggressive fashion and got back into the trend, still averaging 1-2 mins per trade and focusing on 0dte. More progress to come‚Ä¶ stay green folks."
