2023-11-16 06:43:15,arjensmit,How do advisors beat the market ? Or dont they ?,"Warren buffet famously made the bet that fund managers don't beat the market and won that bet.

Now if you google to find the answer if motley fool, seeking alpha or others are worth the price you pay them, you see seemingly independent sources say the stock advise from those pages beat the S&P500 by a landslide over the past 20 years.

How do i put this in perspective ?

I am a new trader. What will be better for me to do: Buy some global ETFs, have faith in Buffet's words and just wait. Or should i make an account at one or maybe even multiple of these sites and build a portfolio out of everything they advise ? I do have a strong interest in learning everything i can. I have already gotten over my dreams of getting rich fast and want to take it safe. Still, i am worried that its all pointless if hedgefunds managers cant beat the market how could i ever expect to do so ?

EDIT:Ok, as i kind of thought, everyone sais the buffet story is the right one. Thanks for all the respons. It does confirm my intuition to a degree. (the intuition that sais, if they can make such profits, every one would be following them, so there must be a catch)I still have some doubts though.

Still, how exactly do motley fool and seeking alpha produce the numbers they report ? They cant blatantly lie i would think ? I mean, they are so well known that outright lying would be obvious and make the news. So what is the catch behind their numbers ?"
2023-11-18 09:51:37,Playingwithfire23,"7 years from $0 to $100k, 3 years from $100k to $200k","I joined eTrade in 2013 a few years after graduating college. I had set up automatic monthly contributions to my accounts, which I slowly raised over time and mostly invested in blue chip stocks. 

On December 1, 2020, the combined value of my Roth and Traditional Brokerage account was just over $100k. It took me over seven years to get there and was a major milestone.  In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35. You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testiment to that fact.  My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire. 

For all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don't rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if you’re patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible. 



Edit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. It’s been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. I’m not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years I’m up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains. 

Investments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors. This is more risky than ETFs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance. I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there’s opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices I jump on it. There’s really nothing super special to it. Not going to share my current exact portfolio, but stocks I have owned in the past or currently include AAPL, GOOGL, META, COST, HD, MCD, DKNG, AMD, DIS, and BAC to name a few. There are many others I’m interested in buying that are on my watchlist.

I will also add that I’ve made a ton of mistakes along the way. Bad investments, selling too soon when I should of just held, taking risky, over leveraged day trades that resulted in nasty losses and wash sales. However, I’ve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn’t be recovered. You can read all the books you want but I’ve always found that the best way is to learn by doing and over time you develop your own skills and are able to trust your own analysis and decisions."

I am also an avid user of Klarna, where my average spend per month is $500-800 with hundreds of transactions processed. I was approved for and placed an order for a maxed out M3 Max Macbook Pro (128gb, 2TB, no support) with Klarna $4950, and the rest with my debit card ($770ish). I had to put down just under $1100. I have never missed a buy now, pay later payment. I also use it for grocery shopping and put almost every purchase I make on it some weeks, including gas, candy, netflix, google domains, adobe creative suite membership, gym membership, tinder, Coachella, airline tickets, etc.

The point of this post is just to say, Reddit's groupthink is not always as rock solid as it seems. What many people in this sub call risky, to the trained eye, is not that bad. So don't worry if they laugh at your DD and your trade. As long as you are honest with yourself, and put in the work to understand the company, the trend, and the risk/reward, you should be fine.

somebody tell me why i’m wrong. there has to be a reason more people dont pile into TQQQ but do pile into QQQ to hold for longterm. is it just risk appetite and they dont want to deal with 3x downturns? im 23 so i still have plenty of time to be able to afford high risk so i would be okay with 3x downturns assuming im not missing something big here."

Yeah, maybe I could make a few thousand before another major pullback in February and March, but what's the point?

I realize a lot don't sell due to taxes, but like I said, I don't have that worry so why should I hold and see my gains evaporate and then have no more significant cash to buy if we get some serious sales in February or March like I think we will?



I've been watching Mad Money and Cramer has been saying ""you should take some gains cause the big money won't start buying mag 7 till they sell off more""

I think that's true.

I.made really good gains in nvda. I bought in at $144 a year and a half ago and I'm up to $490 a share, but it's been topping at $495 or so and then staying in range.

I've also been heavy msft aapl googl asml and lrcx and have very significant gains.

Don't see any reason that any stocks are going to go higher in the next few months till at least April if that.

Sure, maybe oil and utilities and industrials will go slightly higher but I think big money is waiting for the mag 7s to fall.

Anyone else going heavy cash right now?

Yes I'm an investor, but you have to be smart and to me sitting in the market at a top is not really smart, especially if you can sell with no tax consequences.

2024-01-18 14:13:00,123archer,20 stocks till 2049 - buy and hold for 25 years,"Hello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community. 

I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.

https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e

The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.

So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold. 

So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049. 

Here is my list so far. 

1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 )
2. Costco
3. Johnson and Johnson
4. Waste Management
5. CVS
6. Home Depot
7. Boeing
8. Caterpillar
9. GE Aerospace
10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia
11. Walmart/Target
12. Starbucks / McDonalds
13. UPS
14. JP Morgan / Bank of America
15. Berkshire / Markel
16. Disney
17. Tesla / GM
18. Hershey
19. Dollar General
20. Lockheed Martin

Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate. 

Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.

Edit: Some really good points in the comments. 

1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment 
2. Since all of these are mature large companies, maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case, what would you pick?"

> The Nvidia bandwagon is packed and everyone is jumping on it. It’s fun to be right and more fun to be right in good company. But what if everyone is wrong? Isn’t it this type of mania and exuberance that should give the market pause? 

> Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition. This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%.

> over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia’s margins and the company’s ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate. 

> the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house. 

> not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk

2024-02-27 09:53:01,BonjoroBear,Reddit files their S1 and is set for IPO,"Reddit, Inc. files their S1, marking the first social media IPO since Pinterest five years ago. Here are some interesting takeaways for me…

\- Average revenue per user is $3.42, but that is buoyed heavily by the US cohort that has a $5 ARPU vs. $1 ARPU globally. Compare this to Facebook’s ARPU in US/Canada of $68.44.

\- 98% of revenue is from their ads (they have some freemium features but they never really made an impact) but the big question mark is can they monetize the API side and license their data to LLMs. Reddit’s $60m Google licensing deal right on the eve of this S1 is likely to build confidence there, but licensing still feels like the big unknown when it comes to monetization.

\- Reddit gets a massive portion of revenue from just a few top advertisers. CJ Gustafson notes in his analysis of the S1, “The company's advertising revenue is mainly derived from a small number of advertisers, with the top ten largest customers accounting for approximately 28% and 26% of its revenue for 2022 and 2023, respectively.”

\- R&D is 54% of revenue so they are investing heavily here. It feels like Reddit is looking to really lean into new monetization paths moving forward but these are untested.Overall, Reddit is one of the most anticipated IPOs of 2024 (dwarfed only by potentially Stripe). 

I think there is a lot to be excited about, but also a lot of unknowns as Reddit moves to this next growth chapter."

2024-03-04 09:40:52,thechosen10ne,Was told by an advisor to completely change my taxable brokerage portfolio,"Hi all. I recently had a free call with a financial advisor with Empower (my 401k provider). I have been considering going to a local fiduciary fee-only financial advisor service, but figured I'd give the call with Empower a shot first. I have my taxable brokerage account linked up with empower so I can track all my investments in one place. This means that the folks at empower can see the linked accounts and their holdings.

It was a quick 30 minute call where I was able to ask a lot of general questions I wanted answers to. One of the things he recommended to me was completely redoing my taxable brokerage portfolio. Over the past couple of years I have been making automatic direct deposits into my brokerage account every paycheck, and investing in low cost ETFs and high dividend paying ETFs and securities. I also have DRIP enabled so that the dividends would compound and buy more shares and eventually the goal was to get to a sizeable chunk of income that can be relied upon.

The advisor at empower said that at my age I need to be focused on growth only, and that high dividend-paying securities aren't very tax efficient at my age. I am 30 years old. Currently, about 30% of my portfolio is in good stocks that I like (PEP, XOM, MNST, INTC, VZ, T), and the other 70% is in low cost ETFs. Of that 70%, I have roughly 8% SPY, 5% VOO, 4% VUG, 7% QQQM, 16% JEPI, 11.5% JEPQ, 10% SPYI, as well as a few other randoms here and there. I went a little crazy researching low cost ETFs and ones with good dividends and just picked a few that I liked, instead of putting everything into one. I was mainly using JEPI and JEPQ for their divys. I know this portfolio isn't anywhere near 'balanced' so I would definitely like to make some changes. For instance I know SPY and VOO are very similar. I started investing in SPY first, and then found that VOO had a lower expense ratio and the shares were slightly cheaper. This makes buying more shares easier because currently I can't purchase fractional shares of ETFs through my brokerage (Schwab).

Long story short the advisor at Empower told me I should basically sell everything, and do 50/20/20/10 into an S&P 500 Index, Small Cap Index, International Index, and Real Estate Index. This would allow that money to grow without me having to pay taxes on all of these high-paying dividend securities. He also recommended I look at the free Schwab Robo-advisor called [Intelligent Portfolios](https://www.schwab.com/intelligent-portfolios), which I did and it looks interesting.

I have to say that I am giving his advice some consideration, but first wanted to get some more opinions and also I am still planning to visit an in-person local financial advisor.

Edit: I appreciate the feedback so far. Yes, I understand I have made mistakes and the ETF/stock picks may not make sense to a savvy investor. I'm no savvy investor. I will take the advice so far and talk it over with an in-person advisor. I'm just starting out investing in a taxable account outside of my 401k, so I'm learning. Mostly the picks that I have are from reading articles about good low-cost ETFs, and I was focusing on high dividend options without realizing the tax implications. The the Google algorithm took over and just kept feeding me more articles about good dividend ETFs.

  
Edit 2: FYI for anyone who's still reading this. I'm currently maxing out my HSA contributions to the IRS limit and taking full advantage of my employer match and then some. All 401k contributions are currently ROTH only. I have considered doing half ROTH and half traditional to reduce my taxable income. Currently I have an emergency fund that should cover 4-6 months of expenses but it could be stretched if necessary. But to answer your question, no, I currently am not maxing out my 401k. I asked the advisor at Empower if I should stop investing in the taxable account until I am maxing out my 401k and his response was that it's always nice to have liquid investments. Meaning that my taxable account can be used in the event I need cash without the penalties of withdrawing from a retirement account."

I recently took a swing with Rivian. Although they have a lot of risk (tight cash, lots of debt), I do believe the excitement around their products give them a lot of leverage to raise more cash if and when they need it, or entice a partnership with another major tech company.

I have heard Google come up several times as a ""beat down"" stock, as a result of the recent Gemini controversy, but when you look at their historical stock price, it's not like they're way down...they're moderately down in the last month or so.

Who else is out there? Who has had recent trouble but is still fundamentally a good company with ambitious and sharp management?"

I was told that I will lose money and that's not how stock money is made. 

I recall living through times where everyone said ""Buy Microsoft stock!"" and ""Buy Amazon stock!"" and ""Buy Starbucks stock!"" and ""Buy Chipotle stock!"". I always thought, ""Well if everyone is saying it, then it's too easy, people will lose out"". But those all performed very well. 

I had always heard putting money in stocks and leaving it for a long while was best. But the recent advice I got made me question that. 

I'm in my late 30's, and am OK with moderate to a good deal of risk.

2024-03-15 17:34:52,MysteriousShadow__,How is bitcoin up from the abyss?,"When btc first started, there was lots of hype and its value rose quickly (1btc=$60k). In 2022 and 2023 it dropped to 1btc=$16k. That's a massive drop, and full-time btc investors/traders must've had a rough time. At that time I was like ""yeah it's great I didn't buy into btc. It's just a quick concept and this is its end"".

But now somehow it rose back again to a whopping 1btc=$70k. If I had bought the dip, I'd had lots of money now, but again, btc could've dropped more and just died right there.

I haven't really followed btc news and trends at all. I know that btc is volatile and unstable by nature, but there has to be tricks to somewhat predict it or else there won't be so many people taking blind gambles.

So can someone give a timeline of how btc formed, why its value rose, why its value dropped, why it's rising again, and will it drop again in the future?"

What is everyones thoughts on how google will integrate AI without killing their search ad revenue? I don't see how the two can work together because they feel like they work against one another? AI being validated, unbiased, rich information, and search revenue targeting one tiny specific piece to that information pie going to the highest bidder/company with the best SEO strategy (hardly validated, unbiased, or rich).  
I don't necessarily doubt they can release a great AI product, however I question how it will affect their revenue and how they would be able to monetise it without a huge shift in their revenue strategy. E.g Microsoft has a much smaller shift to do as their AI solution will fit seamlessly into their revenue structure (subscription paid per user).

2024-04-07 11:43:30,notmyaccount64744,How to/should I short DJT stock????,"So, the moment I saw this stock I told my mom "" We need to short it.""

I'm my mind, it's obvious. Ignore everything else about Trump, just looking at the financials of this company, it's a social media platform that is not growing, and how people are buying on a hope and a prayer. It's a bubble, even the most generous evaluation of the stock says it's overvalued by a lot, the numbers simply do not match reality. And there is even a road map to when it would pop because in less then 6 months Trump can sell his stake.

I'm my mind it's perfect. I mean, the way you lose money on a short is you expect after X time, the stock went up, not down. But in this case, it seems like there is a very obvious time when it's going to crash, if not before. And as for going up???? Only if some massive tomfoolery happens.

My mom looked at me and said ""No, it's a scam, it's a pump and dump, we wouldn't make money."" She also hates the idea of shorting a stock, I think it bit her or her dad (my grandfather) at one point. But it seems like this is the closest thing to a sure bet one can get. 

But then I thought wait, rule number 1 above all in the stock market or any gambling of any kind, ""the only sure thing is that there is never a sure thing.""

So, am I missing something? Should I avoid what looks like a very golden goose because it's all lead?

And, if I did, this would be my first time ever shorting a stock, how would I do it? I have a Fidelity. I have no intention of taking any loans out or anything, just using some cash I have on hand.

Edit 1: please, considering all things, make sure we keep this civil and that's try not to get too political.

Also, I realize that some of the questions I or others might be asking are ""lazy questions"", sure we could just Google all the information and learn it that way. But isn't the whole point of this subreddit to become more educated when it comes to investing? I mean, we're already here and if you have the knowledge why not share? If have nothing else it might add to the overall pool of human knowledge that is the internet. And Reddit is a part of the Internet, so I am using it, aren't I?

Just remember what your teachers taught in elementary school, there are no dumb questions. And you shouldn't discourage others from asking something you already know.

2024-05-10 11:13:07,captainporthos,Real Estate vs. The Market - An answer to all those touting real estate as the way out there,"Real estate has often been touted as one of the most accessible ways to grow real wealth. Who among us ambitious haven’t heard the platitudinous claims passed off as conventional wisdom or perhaps as an arcane right of passage into occult upper echelons of society?

*“Real estate makes more millionaires than any other industry.”*

We have heard it in forums, self-help books, and from passing snake oil peddlers trying to get you to sign up for their educational seminar so you too can get rich.

As an engineer fortunate enough to not be living pay check to pay check as many Americans do, I also found this promise alluring. After all the basic principle that you can own a second home and collect a sizable and secure supplemental income certainly seems like a good deal at first approximation and so when me and my wife moved out of our first home for new jobs, we decided to keep it as a rental property rather than sell it.

We had purchased the property for only $130,000 dollars in 2017 and after living there for about five years the value had doubled. It was also located in an above average area of growth in South Carolina that had seen explosive growth going from Hicksville, USA to having two Starbucks by the time we moved out (of course the number of Starbucks is the proper measure of affluence). We were able to rent the house out with ease for two years for $1,800 a month while all of the recurring costs amounted to only $1,000 a month.

Indeed on paper it was an excellent investment. But when a difficult tenant started to stress us out we began to wonder if having a rental was worth all the hype in comparison to less stressful alternative investments.

So I decided that rather than scouring the internet for advice from likely unqualified faceless charlatans, I would conduct my own analysis of owning a rental home vs. simply investing in the stock market. After all, at one point in the not so distant past relying on your own mind rather than the top 10 Google search results to reach your own conclusions was considered desirable.

# The Calculation

My methodology was to calculate the total net benefit over the next 22 years (the time until the house would be paid off) in today’s dollars of keeping the rental vs. the total net benefit in today’s dollars of selling it and investing the proceeds in an index fund for 22 years and compare the two results. Although seemingly simple, the reality is that the financials of rentals are convoluted and comparing them to neat investments is *actually kind of difficult.* There are a lot of assumptions and extrapolations that must be made about both benefits and expenses.

The total net benefit for market investing was actually pretty simple. I estimated that the total proceeds from a sale after everything was said and done would be $100,000. So simply applied compounding interest to calculate the value I’d have in 22 years.

For this I assumed the historical average market return of 10% (7% accounting for inflation) as well as a few other higher returns to see how I would fare if things went well.

Because I will not be retired in 22 years and this money would be growing in a traditional taxed brokerage account, I made the assumption that if I wanted to derive regular income from the final capital I would have to sell everything and take the fat 15% long-term capital gains tax in order to move the money from an index fund into a high yield fund providing a yield of 5%. I then further assumed that as income I would have to pay 29% of those earnings in federal and state taxes. This yielded the total income I could expect in my pocket every month after investing for 22 years.

Total derived benefit and possible income for investing $100,000 in index funds after 22 years.

The calculation for the house was much more tenuous, but as I mentioned earlier, you do have to make some big assumptions to make a comprehensive assessment of the total net benefit of renting a house for 22 years. I started by calculating the **total positive factors**:

**Total rent —** Assuming that I will increase rent at 3% to keep up with inflation, I assumed an average rent value for a total present day value of all collected rents over 22 years of $468,600. I then adjusted this value for an assumed vacancy rate of 8% to yield **$431,112 (A)**.

**Appreciation** — Of course one of the benefits of real estate is that it generally appreciates at a rate that is commensurate with the desirability of the location. Before things exploded circa 2022 and houses got crazy expensive, the rate of appreciation in my area was just under 5%. This is a good bit better than the historical national average of 3.5%. Since it is a higher growth area in South Carolina where I’ll used the higher number. At 5% appreciation (2% after accounting for inflation) I can expect the house value to grow from the present value of $250,000 to about $386,494 or an increase of **$136,494 (B)** in today’s dollars.

Although there are *many* other potential benefits of renting a house, at the basic level, the benefits are from rent and appreciation. So the total gross benefit can be calculated simply by adding **A+B** for a total of **$567,606.**

However, the story doesn’t stop there. There are also negatives or *expenses* associated with owning a rental property. The **total negative factors** were calculated as:

**Capital gains tax on sale-** It turns out that when you sell your house after many years of appreciation you have to pay long-term capital gains tax on the profit. *There actually are ways around this* but as we will discuss later they probably are pretty useless to the average one-off real estate investor. So since I paid $130,000 for the house and expect it to be worth $386,494 when I ultimately sell it 22 years from now, the net profit is $256,494 which is taxed at 15% costing **$38,474 (A)**.

**Depreciation recapture tax-** When you rent out a house you get to depreciate it’s value every year like any other large capital assett in a business. This means you can kind of say you “lost” a certain amount of value every year from use. That depreciation ultimately helps lower your taxes every year and so it is a benefit….kind of.

When the time comes to sell your house, you actually have to pay the government back for all the asset depreciation you claimed. You could try to figure this out yourself, but I just used an online calculator and figured that I would have to pay about **$31,200 (B)** in depreciation recapture tax.

**Sales cost —** There are also significant costs associated with actually selling your house. Things like real estate agent commissions and repairs can really add up. Based on some internet research I saw that 8% is a reasonable number for sales cost. It could be more if there are many repairs needed. At 8% it would cost **$30,920 (C)** to sell a house for $386,494.

The total **future expenses at time of sale** can be calculated as **A+B+C** or $100,594. However, this is in 2046 dollars (22 years from 2024). This has to be adjusted to be in present 2024 dollars for the purpose of comparison. The adjusted number in 2024 dollars works out to **$58,432 (D)**.

**Maintenance —** There are also repairs to consider. Any repairs that are not covered by the rent payments come out of your pocket. There are a lot of assumptions that you have to make here. I was actually pretty light on repairs assuming that the tenant wouldn’t trash the place and that only predictable things would need to get done. This included things like replacing the roof once, changing the carpet out three times in 22 years, and painting the place several times, and replacing the wooden privacy fence once. I also made the assumption that most of the repairs would be sooner rather than later. I browsed the internet to get estimated repair costs and life expectancy numbers. For 22 years I estimated **$75,000 (E)** (in today’s dollars). Honestly, I think this number is very light and could easily see it being twice that.

So everything said and done, the total gross expense in present money can be found by adding **D** and **E** for a **total of $133,432.**

The **total net benefit** can *finally* be calculated by subtracting the total expenses from the total benefits, or **$434,174** ($567,606 — $133,432 )**.**

When we compare this with the estimated stock market returns, we see that it is on par with the 11% return (8% after inflation) which is slightly better than the more conservative 7% often quoted. So at that it looks like real estate wins! … however there is still more to consider.

# Other Considerations

Remember why I started looking at this in the first place? I said that having a rental property was beginning to stress me out. Even with a property management company “running things” the reality is that it is impossible for them to take care of your property the way you would want to. They aren’t there day in and day out noticing the slow degradation of condition. Yes, they will catch the big things and hopefully boot tenants that are trashing the place, but the insidious decay will be left un-noticed until it becomes a big enough problem.

For me, being emotionally attached to the house, I find this to be *incredibly stressful.* It is fair to say that not everyone feels that way about their properties, some are able to treat them strictly as business assets that require repair when they stop working. However, you really can’t discount the psychological affects of dealing with someone who doesn’t care about your home the way you do.

So now we are talking about 22 years of stress. That is 22 years of worrying if you are going to go in to sell the place and find that the house should be condemned and repairs would take a tremendous chunk out of what you expected (possible A LOT more than that $75k we estimated). That is 22 years of stress dealing with tenants and having to watch their ridiculous and rude maintenance tickets come through your email where they call you a “slum lord” and tell you that the carpet looks like someone “took a shit on it” (mind you *this* is who is living in the house you once loved).

*Is it still worth the difference?*

That is a personal determination that everyone in this situation must make on their own. In my case, I am leaning towards ‘no.’

*But why does everyone make a bid deal out of real estate? If the actual returns are comparable to the market, why is it so special?*

Now *that* is the question, and I think that we are ready to answer it given the context of the above analysis.

If the total net benefit really is comparable to the market then why in the hell would anyone want to dabble in real estate let alone claim it is *“the way?”*

I am hardly the Supreme Overlord Barron Lord Admiral of real estate investing, but I know enough to tell you that the reasons have to do with those secondary benefits we deferred from earlier.

The primary benefit of real estate is *leverage.* Leverage is the idea that you can own a house using primarily someone else’s money (i.e., the bank’s through a mortgage). This means you get the full benefit of owning a house and renting it (full appreciation, equity, and rent proceeds) with minimal investment of your own. You are taking out a loan to buy an asset and having someone else pay for it. Leverage is possible for stock investing, but houses are much more secure investments and banks realize this and so the rates and terms are much more reasonable than taking out a loan to buy stocks. So why would you ever want to give that up?

The reality is that you are only leveraged while you are …. well, leveraged. As your equity in the house increases (either by paying down the mortgage or through appreciation) you become less leveraged. That is to say that magical benefit of real estate decreases with the less you owe.

Look at it this way. Say you only owe the bank one more dollar on your mortgage; while you still don’t own the house outright, you have nearly 100% equity. That equity is effectively *your money* (not the bank’s) that can be applied to anything and thus it carries an opportunity cost. That is, you have to compare what it is doing for you tied up in the house to what you could get from the market or other investments. If the situation were flipped and you only had one dollar of equity, it is a **much** better deal… you couldn’t do much else with that single dollar. *The more equity you have in your house, the less leveraged it is, and the more it acts like a traditional stock.*

What you’ll find, is that houses perform very much like high dividend, low growth stocks. That is, they provide good income, but appreciate less than the market. When we do the comparison (as we did above) it really does come out as more of a wash than many burgeoning real estate investors might think.

There are other benefits to owning a home. For example, it is real and has an intrinsic value; when the next great depression happens, people will still need a place to live. Plus, since mortgages don’t change with time (that is they get cheaper with time due to inflation) *you* could live there during difficult times, probably for much less than your current rent or mortgage.

Although these are secondary considerations, there are also creative financial mechanisms available for homes. For example, home equity loans or lines of credit can give you a better rate when you need money compared to a private loan. There are also mechanisms to avoid having to pay taxes on your gains (possibly until you die) such as 1031 exchanges, however these are very complicated and are really only designed for real estate investors to turn one property into another. They are nearly useless for the average Joe with maybe one rental (big surprise).

We also hear a lot about the tax benefits of owning rental property. What are those? Well you can claim depreciation. Depreciation is the government’s way of acknowledging that large capital business assets (think a large factory machine) lose value over time as they are used. So you are generally allowed to claim back the full purchase price of your home over the course of 30 years which helps to offset taxes on the rental income. However, you *do have to pay it all back* when you sell the house in a process called depreciation recapture tax. So maybe it isn’t that much of a benefit after all….the real benefit is that since you pay it back later it is worth less due to inflation. Not a huge benefit… You can also claim business operating expenses to also help offset your rental income (think new roof, new windows, repairs, project management fees etc.).

So now seeing the whole picture it is obvious that there are *some* benefits to owning a rental home over investing in the stock market. However, they may not be what you thought. Let’s recap:

* **The total net benefit from renting a house, vs. investing in the market is likely comparable.**
* **Renting a house is much more stressful (even with a management company) than investing in the stock market. You have to have the right kind of personality to not be affected by people trashing your place, being rude to you, and, if this was a home you lived in, the steady decay of a home you once loved (because no, management companies do not maintain houses like you did when you lived there). There is also (i’d argue) a lot more variability in how you’ll fare with real estate (assumptions about vacancy rate, long-term repairs, etc.)**
* **The primary benefit of owning rentals is the ability to leverage into a stable investment on favorable terms. The more of your house you own, the more they perform like traditional stocks and the less argument there is for keeping it due to the opportunity cost of your tied up equity.**
* **There are some secondary benefits, pertaining to taxes, the actual utility of the home, and some creative financing opportunities.**

**So in conclusion:** what does this mean? It means in an apple to apple comparison houses are good investments that rival stock markets but they are much more stressful. However, with leverage being the primary benefit *there is* a real advantage here if you are willing to maximize your leverage in the real estate market.

If you are going to have one house and pay it off and keep it for income, I’d advise you to consider other options if it is stressing you out as (1) it won’t make you rich and (2) it may not be better than the markets. **However,** if you are going to go big and leverage leverage (no not a typo) there is a possibility to do well.

So what does that mean? Money is made in real estate at the front end by making good investments and using (and I mean USING leverage). If you are willing to maximize your credit and home equity usage as much as possible to buy more and more houses putting as little of your own money into each one as possible and you are willing to have a part or full-time job dealing with managing them all and it won’t stress you out, it is **a** path to wealth. Of course, you could also do well just dropping that $100k into the S&P 500 and call it a day."

Surprisingly enough, less well known, cheap books I came across by accident prooved to be more useful. Like How to Keep Score in Business.

For starters, I'd like to read a book that clears up basic terms. What is equity or capital? What is earning, income, revenue or profit? What's the relationship between those? What is a share or stock? What is cash flow? And so on, from the beginning. In layman terms.

Then valuation. Starting from ratio vs percentage, (some books seem to use interchangably), basic math involved, where to get the data from and how to read it? What does split mean for the P/E? And so on... From simple things to more complicated. With studies if possible.

What I don't want is reading about just another famous investor turning a stock into a 3, 5, 10 bagger buy the wise decision of buying it. Or Bond vs stock comparison in the 3 to 5 years time frame with historic data from the 1920's in relation to the Dow using a 3% average annual inflation.

I read (at least started) these books so far:

* - How To Swing Trade
* - Trading: Technical Analysis Masterclass: Master the financial markets
* - One Up On Wall Street: How To Use What You Already Know To Make Money In The Market
* - Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing
* - The Little Book of Common Sense Investing: The Only Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns
* - The Little Book of Value Investing
* - How to Keep Score in Business: Accounting and Financial Analysis for the Non-Accountant

Rebought a few month ago and ready for the next ride. A close second for me is BLDR. Before the recent pull back I was up over 200% and just bought more. What are your biggest winners?
2024-06-03 07:04:35,gabe736,2 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"For context, I planned on holding the original stocks for a few years, but ended up parlaying into AI when I developed strong conviction.

In previous posts, I shared more about the ‘why’ behind the investment decisions and reallocation. The previous 1 year update is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) Interestingly, the stock I lamented missing the run up on (Nvidia) is now by biggest holding and one of my best performers.

# Tracking progress

Below are the gains for this portfolio (opened in 2022) as of May 31, 2024. 

# Realized (sold)

**2023 Totals**

* **Affirm (AFRM):** +18.09%
* **Allbirds (BIRD):** +6.89%
* **Coinbase (COIN):** +6.42%
* **Carvana (CVNA):** +845.57%

All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). 

Peloton was a big loser and the only one I almost immediately regretted, but it was a relatively small investment that was more than offset by others.

I had extra cash, so I purchased small amounts of these in the last week or so: 

* **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):** -2.98%
* **ARM (ARM):** -1.88%
* **Intel (INTC):** -1.42%
* **Microsoft (MSFT):** +2.32%
* **Tesla (TSLA):** -0.54%

I know these are all less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. 

# Rate of return

The total rate of return since inception (June 2022 to May 2024) is **77.90%**. 

# 3 ways my investing evolved

I’m still well within the ‘maybe I’m just lucky’ phase since it’s only been a couple years, but I’ve noticed I invest differently now than I have in the past: 

1. Insight 
2. Conviction 
3. Patience

**Insight**

I’ve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views). 

Ben Graham’s quote rings true: 

>“In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”

Perhaps counterintuitively, I’ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers. 

Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both. 

# Math

In 2023 I also started practicing math daily (243 days straight as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I’d done any meaningful math. 

I’m not sure how much, but it *feels* like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not. 

**Conviction**

A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term. 

However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths. 

Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I’ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I’m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I’m happy I did. 

A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial. 

This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise, you must seize them.

**Patience**

As a result of my convictions, I’m much more patient in my investing these days and don’t react to the day-to-day. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if I don’t make another trade for the rest of 2024.

**UPDATE:**

A commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:

I opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S&P return is \~28% (\~39% for Nasdaq). My cumulative return for that same period is around \~215%. The annual rate of return (per my Vanguard dashboard) is 77.9% as mentioned in the original post. I would expect my returns to revert to the mean over time."

You never rebalance, you just wait until the first trading day of the next year, google the top 20 stocks, and again put $1,000 into each stock. 

  
Over a 20 year timeline, what would the return be? 1990-2010...1995-2015...2000-2020.... 2005-2024... and for funsies: 1927-1947

  
I've looked online, the closest thing I can find is someone buying the top 10 stocks every year and then selling them at the end of the year, then rebuying the top 10 stocks the next year. This on the surface sounds like a terrible/tax inefficient idea and lo and behold it was! I'm not sure why that is what is out there. I feel like what I mentioned here would be a pretty common idea. I'm sure it is I just couldn't find it. 

  
If anyone has any resources to back test it, it would be awesome. thank you

Edit: sorry folks. A lotta wet blankets here. I looked into this a bit because I assumed someone else had done this. Couldn’t find it. Came here, asked, then looked more and realized I could do this myself. I’ll reply back the performance when I get it. 

RESULTS PENDING: so I actually have the results for 1985-2005. The return is SO BAD (compared to s&p), I find it hard to believe. I’m having someone check my work to see if I messed up (this is very VERY likely). Although I believe someone down there in the comments mentioned this strategy wildly underperforms.

2024-06-18 11:23:48,National-Ad8416,Getting on the AI bandwagon,"Hello Everyone, I am already invested in the SP500 through Vanguard (of which AI giants like Nvidia and Google form a major part). I am wondering if it makes sense to buy individual GOOG and NVDA stocks at this point in time (when valuations and prices are high). Alternately, I am also thinking about buying more affordable but promising AI companies (I wouldn't know which) using the philosophy that a rising tide lifts all boats. Or maybe an AI-based sector ETF?

I have never invested in individual stocks before (other than what was granted to me through RSUs) and am not even sure if a play like this makes sense.

Is what I am contemplating prudent? Any feedback (critical or otherwise) is welcome.

EDIT: Thanks for the very spirited discussion and the comments. I am not the type of person to take a plunge into individual stocks all that easily as staying invested in the SP500 has netted me great returns over the years. But there's this itch I feel like scratching hence considering this."

2024-07-17 05:22:59,TraashhBagg,Why are Tech Stocks Falling? ,"I'm confused... is this because people think they are 'overpriced' or because inflation lessened slightly.

Damn, I lost almost 6000 dollars on Microsoft (I have alot invested), almost 2000 on google class A, thousands on the S&P, and some on NVIDIA. I'm still positive overall, but this is going to be rough if they keep falling and take a long time to recover

I made so much more money day-trading and putting the rest of my money in stuff like VTI, QQQ, VHT, AGTHX, and just holding long term. But day trading was so time consuming and I had to constantly be staring at my phone, so I stupidly just dumped a ton of money in Microsoft for some reason lol"

2024-07-19 11:52:38,Valvador,Any way to estimate the full financial impact of this CrowdStrike incident?,"* Was having trouble getting some banking statements to download yesterday...
* Tried to use my work laptop last night around 10pm noticed it had Blue Screen of Death
* Started trying to debug it, realized it was my company's nanny anti-virus of choice... Crowdstrike
* Google Crowdstrike Marketshare: ~23% of anti virus solutions... Oh fuck.
* Told my wife, before going to bed: ""Prepare, tomorrow is going to be a historic event""

This morning, holy shit. Airports, Banks, Hospitals, all getting screwed.

Market pulled back, but I don't think the bean-counters have fully understood the extent of this damage. Repairing the issue is not something you can do remotely, it literally requires a physical person to access the machine, reboot it in safe-mode and delete some files one machine at a time. If your machine uses Bitlocker encryption, you need to make sure you have the Bitlocker backup key to every single one of those machines. 

So you have an update that auto-deployed on a bunch of Windows machines that requires manual 1-at-a-time intervention to fix. Have we ever had an incident on this scale? I expect markets to dip for a while from the fallout of this.

Anyone know any ways to model this? VTI barely pulled back from this, but I expect there to be significantly more fallout as time passes.

EDIT: What is going on with this thread? If you sort by Controversial, it's the top right now. Why is this controversial? 

EDIT: Some interesting testimonials from [Bay Area redditors about direct impact of this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/1e77pxt/question_how_is_the_crowdstrike_debacle_impacting/)

EDIT: This is not a fear-mongering post. I am more curious about systematic discussion of impacts like this on investments across the board. Once in a lifetime events are interesting because their novelty makes it difficulty to model. In times like this getting a variety of sincere, thought out opinions is interesting to me.  

If all you want to do is come into this post and type ""HODL"" or some other crypto-like one liner, or even VTI and chill, please save us both the trouble and don't."
2024-07-23 07:52:21,BobbyFuckkingAxelrod,Google Q2 Earnings Preview: Three things are worth paying attention to,"Alphabet will release second-quarter financial results after the market closes on Tuesday, revealing the magnificent 7 earnings season. Here are 3 things that should be scrutinized:

**First: the growth in Alphabet's spending and capital investment for AI.** Google needs to show that AI is driving Google Cloud growth, that there are no share losses in Search as users start leaning more on AI chat, and that the new models being built are competitive.

**Second: the company's guidance on adv sales growth in the second half year.** Media investment firm GroupM raised its 2024 global advertising growth forecast to 7.8% in June, from 5.3% in December, primarily on account of better-than-expected spending in China and the United States.

Analysts also expect strong performance at YouTube, thanks in part to expanded monetization features in its TikTok-styled video offering, Shorts.

**Third: Any progress in monetizing AI cloud services** (that is, will customers pay up for the company's AI offerings). The company could provide updates on projects like its AI assistants, Gemini Live and Project Astra, which could help compete with OpenAI. It may offer insights into how AI Overview is affecting Google Search. 

Google will infuse artificial intelligence into the U.S. broadcast of the Paris Olympics, allowing sports commentators to use AI to explain competitions."

There is a lot of talk about passive funds creating causing over-valuation. But if that is true - shouldnt other asset classes -  real estate be cheaper? Or bonds should give exceptionally high returns (before Fed raised interest rates, bond prices were high too/yields were low). Maybe I am confusing the topic by bringing up Fed, so ignore bonds/Fed rates if thats the case.

But I am unable to see which asset class is available for relatively cheaper as a result of disproportionate money flowing into equities due to passive investing.

Will appreciate if someone can point to what I am missing?

  
EDIT - My main point is about demand and supply of money and assets. If money disproportionately flows into 1 asset, shouldnt other assets become cheaper due to disproportionately less money flowing into them? Assuming supply of money is fixed "

The most likely resolution will be that the first time you turn on your iPhone you are given a screen with the different search engines in a random list.

You then choose your search engine.  Free to change later but likely most will not.  This will be basically you choosing your default search engine.

Obviously this would be very bad for Apple.  Today, Apple sells the access to their customers and Google has been reported to pay Apple over $15 billion per year.  Some estimate over $20 billion.

I believe this is going to be the toughest decision yet needed to be made by Tim Cook.   He could have Apple try to create their own search engine and then sell advertising with the new Apple search engine to try to replace the lost revenue.

Then Apple would be one of the search engine options when you first turn on your iPhone and the hope would be people would choose the Apple option over the Google option.

What other options does Tim Cook have to replace the Google money?"

When Standard Oil was split into smaller companies, the combined market value of the individual entities exceeded that of the original company.

how real is the process and is it regulation? shouldnt the info on the processes and fees be disclosed somewhere on the website regardless if it usa or intl?

can anyone help clarify info, guidelines, rules? its very confusing when its not explained well and the dam financial jargon is a headache. if i had morw detailed and non-confusing info on how the system works, understanding the process would be easier to digest.

thanks in advance!"

My mother is 73. Does she have to notify her financial advisor about the fact that she's 73 and has to withdraw her money?

At what point can she wait till? like December?

She doesn't need the money, so do most people put it in a brokerage account? I want to know sorta what I'm talking about when i speak with the advisor with her.

Oh, and you can open up more than 1 brokerage account, correct?..

She has a brokerage account, but it's in a irrevocable trust.. so ..well tehnically you can, but it defeats the purpose of the trust. for medicaid planning

Thanks!"
2024-08-27 11:28:47,howisthisillegal,Inactive 401k - Take the Penalty?,"Hi All,

I’ve got a 401k worth about $12k and it has performed terribly in the past five years…as in it has gone from 11k to 12k. 

This 401k is from an employer I left in 2018 so it’s just been sitting around collecting dust. 

Would it be wise to take the 10% loss for an early withdrawal and throw it into my brokerage account? I feel like if I could put it in ETFs and dividend funds it’ll be worth much more in 10 years than if I leave it in the funds it’s currently in. 

Edit: Spelling error"
2024-09-02 16:32:03,ThinkBigger01,Honestly.. is AI profitable or a bubble?,"During Google's last earnings call, when they were being asked if their gigantic spending (capex) on AI can actually turn a profit, they remained very vague. As a result the stock sold off. Well there were other reasons for it, for example that their youtube revenue was problematic, but the bottom line is that alot of big tech is spending massive amounts of money (capex) on AI but can't really explain how all of that will become profitable. Do you think AI can be profitable (and if so how) or is it really just the latest bubble similar to the late 90s? Which companies will actually be able to turn this into profit and which simply jumped on the hype with nothing to show for?"
2024-09-06 15:39:42,WellThatsNoExcuse,Looks like Russia is gearing up to snip underwater fiber cables...how would you hedge this risk?,"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/us-sees-increasing-risk-of-russian-sabotage-undersea-cables/index.html

So it appears Russia is now abandoning subtlety in booby trapping global undersea fiber cables, presumably to use in the event of a hot war, or maybe as a bargaining chip to get the west to back off something important.

Either way, this seems like a serious threat to major infrastructure. If they followed through, it could effectively shatter the global internet into a handful of continental sections, causing massive economic disruptions.

Who stands the most to lose and gain if this happens? What ""panic button"" trades would you queue up if you were guaranteed of 10 minutes notice warning that this was about to happen? Presumably one would need to structure this globally to get 24 hour coverage."

I also just hard code my CD's in there and just display the value of the CD after maturity in the annual dividend income field.  I just bought into BlackRock Treasury Trust Fund TTTXX in order to park some money there.  I have a decent amount in SGOV so figured it's best not to put more into that fund.  Anyway, does anyone know a good way to pull in data from these mutual funds?  Like to automate pulling in the name of the fund based on like TTTXX.  Obviously it's worth a $1 a share.  Not sure if it can pull in the current percent one should expect to make off it?  Or do I just need to hard code it and calculate the growth say until the end of the year manually?"

Here's the question: what if I have a stop order at $19 and someone fat-fingers a trade to sell ABC at $1.  Surely the $1 order will be filled.  And so my (and everyone one else's) stop orders would trigger?  Wouldn't this one instance of fat-fingering have the potential to cause a lot of ""unintended"" trades?

Am I misunderstanding how this all works?

2024-09-23 08:26:23,Tmorr,How do you track your rate of return between all your accounts? ,"I've recently been curious about my rate of return over the past 5 years that we've been taking investing seriously. Between my spouse and I, we have 6 investment accounts between old and current 401ks, Roth iras, and brokerage accounts between different brokerage companies.

When I log into those accounts I can see the rate of return they give for that specific account, but I want to know what the rate of return is for all of our accounts combined.

My solution so far has been to track the year end balance of all accounts in a spreadsheet. And do a weighted return calculation from like the 2023 end balance compared to the 2022 end balance. Taking into account our total contributions to get the total weighted rate of return.

Is this an accurate way to calculate rate of return or is there a better way? Are there any online tools you use to track this between all your accounts?

2024-09-29 22:59:45,Upbeat_Sun_7904,Anybody else investing mostly in companies whose products/services they personally use and love?,"I think mainly Peter Lynch was the one who among other great advice suggested that people should invest in companies whose products/services you or your family and friends use and love. According to his books Lynch often found investment ideas in everyday life. He encouraged investors to observe the products and services they use and consider investing in the companies behind them. That seemed like a great advice to me 20 years ago when I started investing and I haven’t regretted it since. Here are the companies I invested in following this advice and still hold:

Apple, Amazon, Disney, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Nike, Uber, Mastercard, Nintendo

Now I’m thinking about Reddit lol. However, I’m not very excited about the prospects of it becoming profitable. Maybe a small position just to watch and see what happens in the future?

However, would be really interesting to know if some of you have practiced this advice as well and how has this advice served you in the past and which companies have you invested in? Thanks!"
2024-10-07 04:56:32,Away_Department_8480,What is going on with all the advertisements where companies beg for investments?,"I keep seeing advertisements where companies are looking for investors.

  
My understanding of the startup world, is that if these companies had any likelihood of succeeding they'd be able to reach out to angel investors to get funds.

  
Since they are posting advertisements on google, it seems like they weren't able to convince any of those angel investing groups and are desperate, looking to lure in random people off the internet for a few hundred dollars at a time. This starts to get into borderline scam territory, where it seems very pertinent to question whether these advertisements/companies are even real entities to begin with.

  
My main question is though, is it even reasonable to entertain these types of investing opportunities? Or is the fact that they are advertising on Google ads such a huge red flag you'd immediately turn tale and run as fast away as possible?"

I have often observed scammers that speak English as a second language use terms inappropriately, so I’m going to chalk this up to a group of scammers using the wrong terminology.


Just FYI, I already googled “stock deployment” and point blank asked the originator of the partnership invitation to give me specifics on what was meant by “deployment.”

Background:  I was recently invited to join a group that was recruiting people to join a long term partnership for investing.

As an introduction to the partnership managers and enticement to join the group, they are “deploying” short term gain stocks for the first few days of their recruitment period. 

Some of the people in the group chat are already saying they have realized up to an 85% gain on the stock that was “deployed” yesterday.  I’m not convinced, and am suspicious!  It is clear that people who participated are NOT getting these stocks for free.  It’s NOT clear what is really going on here.

The word “deployment” really bugs me because in my mind you deploy troops, not stocks!

So, can anyone help me understand this “deployment” business?"

I am proud of it and thought I would share here. While the guide is a lot more than just investing and so may not be ideal for this subreddit, I definitely think it hits some investing FAQs. 

For context, I am a 23 year old that became obsessed with personal finance at 17. I was able to hit a $100k net worth and 750 credit score at 22 prior to my peers' college graduation. Yes, I had some form of slight help from family, but I come from middle class and no money/inheritance was given to me. The point is not that I am some genius and successful. The point is that I learned some good advice online, actually followed a lot of it and want to share what I've learned. 

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: The advice contained is simply what I personally know. 99% of it I learned as a 17 year old in high school. The financial institutions/products I mention are simply what I have used and thus recommend. I understand that the companies/funds/credit cards are not perfect and there may be better options. Do your own research. I understand that what has worked for me will not work for everyone.  I understand that there are a lot of other great or better ways to go about things. I don't claim this to be a perfect guide by any means. I am 23 and not a financial advisor. It's just a guide I made initially for my cousin. It's not that deep.

Guide TLDR: Live below your means, have an emergency fund, establish your credit safely and invest what you can in a Roth IRA.

This is my guide to have a good hold on your finances through saving and investing. This guide should give you a general idea of what to do, however it is mostly based on my own experience and what I have learned online. When it comes to what banks and brokerage accounts to use, I recommend that you do your own research and explore other options. The accounts I mention are simply what I use and so I recommend them. Different companies are always changing and improving so there may be better options out there.

5 Steps to Get Ahead in Your 20’s

\*The following steps are generally in order of importance. Ideally, you should have the previous step accomplished prior to later steps\*

Step #1 - General Bank Accounts

* ●  Open a checking and savings account with Capital One ○ Checking Account: “360 Checking” ○ Savings Account: “360 Performance Savings” (If names havechanged, make sure the account is a high yield saving’s account)
* ●  Along with the checking account, you will receive a debit card to be able to

make purchases in person with

* ○  You will also receive a checkbook with personal checks
* ○  For your debit card and checks, you can only spend what is in yourdebit card account

● Keep all of your savings in the savings account and keep $100-$500 in

your checking account  
○ When making a purchase with debit card or checks, transfer from

savings to checking  
● The savings account will usually generate 2% to 5% interest per year

which will be paid monthly  
○ Ex. If you have $10,000 in your savings, 3% would pay you $25

each month ($300 for the year = 3%)

Step #2 - Emergency Fund

* ●  Maintain 3-6 months of living expenses in a savings account
   * ○  Ex. $2,000/mo living expenses = $6,000-$12,000 minimum
   * ○  A minimum regardless of living expenses is $5,000
* ●  (RECOMMENDED) If you want to ensure you do not spend your emergency fund, open a second high interest savings account with a second bank, transfer the full emergency fund balance there and forget you have it!

■ I recommend CitiBank or Discover since I recommend their credit cards

Step #3 - Early Debt Pay Off  
\*Skip this step if you do not have bad debt or your debt interest rate is below 2%\*

● Determine if/how much you can pay extra towards your debt per month ○ I recommend 30% of your income to be for saving/investing (I

consider paying debt in the “investing” category  
■ If you have your emergency fund saved in full, you should put

30% of your income towards paying down bad debt  
● Set up automatic payments (or reminders if not possible) to pay extra

towards debts  
○ Ex. You have your emergency fund saved up and make $50,000/yr

after taxes. 30% of $50,000 is $15,000 to invest per year. You can set up an auto payment to pay an additional $1,250/mo towards your bad debt.

* ●  Examples of bad debt to pay off early include credit card debt, student loans and private loans/payday loans
* ●  When you have debt, you are losing money to negative interest. If you are able to pay that debt off and then invest the money you were paying towards the debt, you not only are no longer losing money to negative interest, but you are gaining money from positive interest

○ Ex. You are paying $300/mo towards credit card debt. $150/mo of that money is towards the interest. After you save and pay off that debt early, you now invest that $300 into

Step #4 - Credit Card

\*Skip this step if you are not disciplined with finances and may spend more than you have\*

* ●  Open a “Discover It Secured Card” with Discover Bank ○ You will be required to put down a deposit which you will receive in7-10 months so long as you pay all payments ○ You cannot spend more than your deposit so I recommend a depositof $500-$1,000 ○ Connect your general savings account and set up an auto paymentto pay off the full balance every month ○ Subscribe to email notifications and manually pay off your accountevery time you get an email that your new statement is ready inaddition to the auto-pay
* ●  Use the credit card for all possible purchases to get cash back (2% on gasand restaurants, 1% on everything else)
   * ○  To be safe and not spend more than you have in your savings,always check your savings account prior to making a purchase tomake sure you have enough money
   * ○  NEVER SPEND MORE THAN YOU HAVE IN YOUR SAVINGS
* ●  After 7-10 months, you will receive your full deposit bank and your card limit will increase from that amount to a higher amount

○ As a bonus, go into the discover app and request a higher limit every 6-12 months

■ Based on your income, monthly expenses and job, the bank may give you a higher limit, which can improve your credit score

● With a secured card you can establish/improve your credit score ○ A breakdown of credit score is included later in this guide

Step #5 - Roth IRA Investment Account

\*You can only invest in a roth if your income is below the maximum requirement ($160k in 2024) and you are investing taxed income (you must have a job and it cannot be cash under the table)\*

* ●  Create an account with Fidelity and open a “Roth IRA”
* ●  Determine the maximum amount you can invest each month based onyour income
   * ○  I recommend 30% of your income to be saved and invested (If youare not saving for a large purchase or your emergency fund, the full30% should be invested)
   * ○  $7,000 is the current annual maximum for a ROTH IRA (2024)($583/mo)
* ●  Connect your general savings account and set up automatic investing to purchase two different mutual funds or ETFs every month
   * ○  75% of the monthly investment should purchase FXAIX or “Fidelity 500 Index Fund” (S&P 500 / the US Stock Market)
   * ○  25% of the monthly investment should purchase FSPSX or “Fidelity International Index Fund” (the International Stock Market outside of the US)

■ Make sure that dividends are reinvested automatically  
○ Ex. Each month $400 is transferred from your general savings account with Capital one. $300 is invested into the US Stock Market (Fidelity 500 Index fund) and $100 is invested into the International Stock Market (Fidelity International Index Fund)

* ●  Never ever withdraw funds from this account or any other investment account if possible (unless retired or for dire emergency after emergency fund is empty)
* ●  Stick to investing in low cost Mutual Funds or ETFs (the funds mentioned above). Investing in individual stocks can result in a better investment, however usually investing in a large fund that represents many companies (such as the entire US stock market or international market) will be the safer bet that nearly ensures you will get a solid return over time
   * ○  Investing in individual stocks is gambling
   * ○  Investing looking to make money in the short term (less than 10years out) is not investing. It is trading. Trading is gambling.

Bonus Steps for your 20’s:

1. If your employer offers a 401k match, always take it and invest the maximum match amount

* ○  This is more important/better than your Roth IRA and if you cannot do both, do the 401k match instead of the Roth
* ○  If you can do both, invest the full 401K match and then invest the remainder of your investment funds into your Roth IRA2. Additional credit cards
* 2.   If you are very responsible with credit cards, will never spend morethan you have, and always pay them off each month in addition to autopay, you can receive some better benefits with more cards■ 2nd Card - Citi Double Cash: 2% back on everything ■ 3rd Card - Citi Custom Cash: 5% back on one category ofchoice (I do gas personally)
* ○  If you are an independent contractor or business owner, designate acredit card for all of your business expenses (so you can easily trackexpenses for write offs)
* ○  I never recommend getting any credit card that has an annual fee

Additional Steps for your 30’s

\*Move on to these steps in your 20’s if you can\*

1. Hire a financial advisor  
If you make enough to where you can invest more than the Roth IRA annual maximum, you should hire a financial advisor  
Make sure they are a fiduciary advisor  
A cheap option is to hire them only for flat fee based financial planning (general guidance instead of them doing the investing for you)

2. Start investing in bond funds  
Change your automatic investments in your Roth IRA so that your stock allocation is 120 minus your age

* Ex. 30 year old is 120 - 30 = 90% stocks 10% Bonds
* Ex. 50 year old is 120 - 50 = 70% stocks 10% Bonds With your new bond allocation %, set up your auto investment to purchase FXNAX or “Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund” Every 5 years, adjust the automatic investment to align with the 120 minus your age rule

3. If you can afford to invest more than the Roth annual limit, contribute more to your 401K

○ OR other great options include:

* HSA: Pre and Post Tax Investment account that can only bespent towards healthcare and medical costs (Tax benefits ofROTH IRA and 401K combined)
* 529 College Savings Plan: Post tax investment account (likeRoth IRA) that must be spent on a family member’s education costs (use to save for kid’s college)4. Save up for and purchase a home
* ○  While still contributing to your investment accounts, start settingaside funds monthly to save up to purchase a home
* ○  Use your emergency second savings account or a 3rd savingsaccount so that you don’t accidentally spend the money

Saving Tips

Saving is, in my opinion, the most important aspect to one’s financial health. You must save to establish your emergency fund. You cannot pay off debt without saving the money to pay it. You cannot safely use a credit card without having savings. You cannot invest without saving that money first.

Living below your means can allow you to have less stress in your life, choose a lower paying, but more enjoyable career path, spend money on “the big important things”, afford to cover emergency costs, pay for incredible experiences, retire at a reasonable/early age and actually afford to raise children.

As of 2024, 56% of Americans do not have savings to cover a $1,000 emergency (per CNBC and FOX). For many young people, in my eyes, making money isn’t the issue. It’s actually saving money. Saving money is very simple. However, it’s also very hard at the same time. If you spend less than you make, you will save money. We all know that, however, what makes it so difficult is the emotional side of it. You have to get out of your comfort zone and make changes to the way you think if you want to change your spending habits into saving habits.

Tactical Tips:  
Before you buy anything, ask yourself if you actually need it - You were

living before, weren’t you?

Wait to Buy Something - Impulse purchases are deadly. If you really want it that bad, you will still want it a week or month from now. The bigger the purchase, the longer you should wait.

Have a spending account and a savings account - Only make payments out of your checking account and only transfer from your savings when you need to. An even better method is to open a second high yield savings account with another bank. Then you can put your savings there and forget about the money. That way you can keep your spending money in your general savings account and collect interest on both saving and spending funds.

Don’t Window Shop - Window shopping can be a fun way to pass time, however if you are going into a store without the intention to buy a specific item you need, every single thing you end up buying is unnecessary. Or if you need a specific item, go straight to that item and straight to the register. Don’t browse!

Review your Expenses - Simply take 5 minutes to review your bank or credit card statements once a month. You might be shocked at how much you are actually spending. You might also find old subscriptions you can cancel.

Set up an automatic savings transfer from your spending account to your savings account - If possible, time this with your paycheck deposit. Just like with an automatic transfer to your investment account, you can just forget you have the money and you never even see it! You don’t miss the taxes taken out of your paycheck so you want to have the same setup with your saving/investing.

Mental Shifts to Tell Yourself Before you Spend Money:

“Stop using material things to fight insecurity” - Everyone wants nicer cars, homes, clothes, the list goes on. Why? Mostly because of status. We put our own value in our material possessions. Be that confident 70 year old that wears what’s comfy, drives an old, reliable car, and lives in a quaint, outdated home. Don’t wait until you’re old to realize what’s really important. Work on that now.

“The little things add up” - $2 here, $5 there, $13 here. Next thing you know, your credit card statement is $800.

“Would I rather this small thing now or this big thing later?” - Would you rather an expensive gym membership or would you rather a second vacation each year? Would you rather go out to dinner and drinks every week or would you rather be able to save up and buy a house?

“How many hours/shifts of work does this cost?” - Is buying that dinner worth it if it cost you an entire day’s work? Is spending an hour of work worth buying your lunch out vs bringing it from home? Is an expensive vacation worth 2 months of hard work or should you go the cheaper route? This also works great for commission jobs. How many cars/apartments/ect. would I have to sell to buy this?

“Saving is a tax free way of “making” money” - You can either work to make $130 and get $100 after taxes or you can just save the $100.

“What is more important to me, having nicer things or being stress free financially?” - Is that second vacation worth the stress of running up a credit card you cannot pay off? Is that daily starbucks coffee worth the stress of paying rent late? Is that nicer car worth the stress of not being able to afford to move out of your parents?

“If I invested this money today instead of spending it, I would have X when I’m older” - Use a compound interest calculator to understand generally how much your money will grow until retirement. When you are a 20 year old, each dollar you invest now should grow about 20 times itself by age 65 (10 times itself as a 30 year old). If you are 20, ask yourself if you want to spend $1,000 on something you don’t need now or have $20,000 to spend on something when you are older.

“I’m stealing money from the future me/family” - What do you value more, the novel item you don’t need right now or something you care more about in the future? Would you rather drive a nicer car now or would you rather be able to vacation every year after you retire? Would you rather spend money on yourself now or your family in the future?

“Instead of buying this every day/week/month, I invested it, how much would I have later?” - How much money could you invest if you downgraded from a $100 gym membership to a $20 membership? How much money could you invest if you got a car with a $300 monthly payment instead of $500? How much could you invest if you split rent with a roommate to pay $1,000/mo instead of $1,800. Someone who buys a $6 coffee five days a week could instead invest that $30 per week to have over $350,000 extra at retirement.

If you like to gamble/buy scratch tickets: “Do I want an impossible chance to have $100,000 today or do I want an almost guaranteed $100,000 in 30 years” - A 30 year old who spends $20 per week on scratch tickets will very likely never win big even if their habit continues for life. However, if that person invested that $20/week starting at age 30, they would likely have $113,000 at 60.

Brief Guide to a 750 Credit Score

A credit score is extremely important, however it’s something that there is a lot of confusion about. While many know what a credit score generally is, most don’t know all of the factors that determine the score and thus how they maintain a high score.

First off, a credit score or “FICO” score is how businesses and financial institutions like banks determine how qualified you are for certain services. Your credit score will be a factor in determining not only if you can get a loan for things like a car, house, ect. but also can determine what your interest rate will be on that loan. You also can be required to have a credit score to finance purchases like appliances and furniture or very commonly in order to rent an apartment. The higher your credit score, the higher the likelihood that a landlord will let you rent their apartment and later on, the cheaper your car and home will be.

Building a good credit score can take a very long time, however ruining your credit score can happen in an instant and can often take many years to repair. The easiest and most common way to lower your credit score is by missing a payment. This is why it is so crucial that you have autopay setup on all of your loan payments and credit cards.

If you have a bad credit score, you may find yourself unable to rent an apartment, buy a home, or buy a car. This is because you are seen as risky and untrustworthy. If your score is fair but not good, you will find yourself paying high interest rates. Because of this, you want to maintain a score above 700.

Credit Scores are typically seen as follows:

300 - 579 = POOR  
580 - 669 = FAIR  
670 - 739 = GOOD  
740 - 799 = VERY GOOD 800 - 850 = EXCELLENT

When it comes to apartments, you generally need to fall into “good” or better to rent. In order to get the best interest rates on loans for cars/homes you generally need to fall into the “Very good” category or better.

Credit scores are determined by the following categories below. The percentage represents how much this category makes up a score and so a higher percentage means a more important category.

Payment History - 35%  
Credit Utilization Rate / Amounts Owed - 30% Length of Credit History - 15%  
New Credit Opened - 10%  
Credit Mix - 10%

What each category means and how to do well in each:

Payment History - How often have you made payments on time?

1. Never miss a payment. Set up autopay AND manually pay off monthly.
2. Open cards sooner. The longer a card has been on your history the morerecorded payments on your history.
3. Have more cards/loans. The more lines of credit, the more on timepayments. Don’t close card accounts for this reason.

\*If you do miss a payment, #2 and #3 help. Having many total payments makes your percentage of late payments smaller.\*

Ex. If you have one credit card for 10 months and miss one payment, you’re late 10% of the time. If you have 5 credit cards for 5 years and miss one payment, you’re only late 2% of the time (1/10 vs 1/60)

Credit Utilization Rate / Amounts Owed - How much of your total credit limit are you spending? (credit cards) / How much do you owe? (Loans)

1. Pay off your cards in advance of the statement date. Manually or with autopay, pay most or all of your current balances so that the balance is very low compared to your limit. Ex. If your limit is $1,000 and you have a $900 balance, your utilization rate on that card is 90%. If you pay $850 of the balance before the statement period ends, the statement balance will be only $50 which is just 5% of your limit.
2. Have more credit cards. The more cards, the higher your total limit. This is another reason why you should not close a credit card.
3. Ask for limit increases. You can easily do this right in your banking app or call from a phone. Income, expenses, and credit score will determine the increase
4. For amounts owed, you really can only pay off debt. Save money so you can pay it off ahead of time. Don’t just make minimum payments.

Length of Credit History - How long is your average line of credit?

1. Open up lines earlier in life. If you know you will get a certain credit cardeventually, get it now.
2. Be smart about timing of new lines. When possible, do not acquire newlines of credit prior to a life event that requires good credit.
3. Have more lines. When you open a new line of credit it does not affect you as much with more lines since that line represents a smaller percentage ofthe total amount of lines. Ex. A second credit card is 50% of your lines, however a 10th line of credit is only 10% of your lines.

New Credit Opened - How recently have you opened a line of credit? 1. Follow the same first two tips above for “Length of Credit History”

Credit Mix - Is the mixture of types of lines of credit diverse?  
1. Have different types of lines of credit. There's mainly revolving (credit

cards) vs installment (loans). Ex. It’s better to have a mortgage, car loan and two credit cards rather than just 4 credit cards

Payment history is the most important by far and so it’s crucial to stay on top of all lines of credit and ensure payments are being made and made on time. If there is an accident and a payment is not made or made late you can actually call your creditor and potentially have them remove the late payment.

Keep in mind that you should never make bad financial decisions in order to increase your credit score. You also don’t want to complicate your finances. With one or two lines of credit, you can easily get a good score after just a couple years of on time payments.

Credit should not be taken lightly. If you are not financially responsible, do NOT get a credit card. The benefits are not worth the consequences of bad credit or even worse, snowballing credit card debt.

Compound Interest Explained (Why you Should Invest)

Saving is necessary in order to invest, however investing is much more powerful. When you invest, you are paid a percentage yield.  
In other words, your money grows. But the beautiful thing about the growth is that it is not linear. It is exponential.

A simplified example of this can be with a high yield savings account and $100. Let’s say the savings account has an annual yield of 5%. That means after one year, the savings account would have given you $5. However, in year 2, you do not get $5. Why? Because you are no longer being paid 5% of $100, you are being paid 5% of $105. 5% of $105 is $5.25. The next year you are paid 5% of $110.25 which is $5.51. Each year you are paid more and more because the interest compounds on top of itself. Compounding interest!

Saving on the other hand, is linear. Fortunately, high yield savings accounts do have compound interest, however the annual yield is typically much much lower than stocks and checking accounts don’t have any interest at all. If you were to save $100 every month, rather than investing it, it would look like the blue line on the chart above. However if you invested it, the growth would compound on top of itself and look like the red line.

  

Example - A $5,000 one time investment at 7% interest per year:  
\*The first number is the new amount and the second number is the amount gained in the 5 years\* Year 5 - $7,012 (+$2,012)  
Year 10 - $9,835 (+$2,823)  
Year 15 - $13,795 (+$3,959)  
Year 20 - $19,348 (+$5,553)  
Year 25 - $27,137 (+$7,788)  
Year 30 - $38,061 (+$10,924)

In the first 5 years, the $5000 would grow an additional $2,012. However in just the final 5 years (from year 25 to 30), the investment would grow an additional $10,924. That is over double the original $5,000 alone! Compound interest!!

If you contribute $7,000 annually to a Roth IRA from age 20 to 65, with an average annual yield of 7%, you would have approximately $2,140,262.34 by the time you reach age 65. Tax Free! (\*7% is a decent inflation adjusted estimate of growth based on investing in the US Stock Market\*)

Because of the fact that compound interest gets better and better the longer it works, the earlier you start investing the better. Not just better, but much better. The downsides of starting later are also exponential (same math but backwards).

Example - $5,000 invested per year at 7% interest per year: (at different ages) \*The amount next to the age is the total amount the fund would grow to by age 65\*  
18 Years Old - $1,881,579.00  
20 Years Old - $1,633,771.07

25 Years Old - $1,142,920.14 30 Years Old - $792,950.21 40 Years Old - $365,519.51 50 Years Old - $148,235.43

Each year matters a lot. The difference between starting at 18 and 20 years old is $253,808 even though you would only invest $14,000 in those two years at 18 and 19. Start as early as possible! Even if it's only $100 a year.

By the way, if you start saving $5,000 a year at 18 instead of investing it, you would only have $235,000 instead of $1,881,579. Don’t just save!

Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA (401k)

Roth IRA taxes income but not stock growth (“Post tax”)  
Standard IRA (401k) taxes stock growth but not income (“Pre tax”)

When you are young, your income is usually low, but the investments you make will grow a lot by the time you retire. You want the low income to be taxed and not the high stock growth.

When you are older, your income is usually higher and since your investments do not have as much time to grow until retirement, the growth is low. You want the low stock growth to be taxed and not the high income. In conclusion, when you are in your 20’s and 30’s it is generally better to invest your money in a Roth IRA

\*remember that if your employer offers a 401k match, invest the maximum amount that will be matched by the company and invest the remaining money you can into a Roth IRA - The match is better than the tax savings of a Roth\*

Example #1 - Roth IRA

Income: $50,000  
Age: 25 (40 Years of Stock Growth to Retirement) Amount Invested that Year: $5,000  
Amount at Retirement: $74,872

Example #2 - 401k

Income: $100,000  
Age: 50 (15 Years of Stock Growth to Retirement) Amount Invested that Year: $7,000  
Amount at Retirement: $19,313

In example #1, you want to be taxed on the $50,000 income and not the \~$70,000 of tax growth. In example #2, you want to be taxed on the \~$12,000 of stock growth and not the $100,000 of income.

2024-10-19 03:41:38,Charming-Log-9586,I want to retire at 60 then collect SS at 62 so I'll need healthcare. Can HSA's be using to pay insurance premiums to help me bridge the gap until I hit 65?,"  
I Google and get two different answers.

By using untaxed dollars in an HSA to pay for deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and some other expenses, you may be able to lower your out-of-pocket health care costs. **HSA funds generally may not be used to pay premiums**.

  
**You generally can't use HSA funds to pay premiums**. Once you turn 65, you can use the money in your HSA for anything you want. If you don't use it for qualified medical expenses, it counts as income when you file your taxes. Six months before you retire or get Medicare benefits, you must stop contributing to your HSA."

I want to invest it, my grandpa did that over the course of his life and did really well.
However, he’s from a generation where if someone seems nice or educated that automatically means to him they are qualified.
I don’t think that way.

I started off by speaking to someone at Edward jones, she turned me off instantly by asking me to give her a Google review having not done anything yet. She didn’t promise anything ridiculous however, after reading on Reddit the awful and overwhelming negative comments regarding Edward jones I’m off to search for something else.

I have no investing skills what so ever, my husband does but went into future trading which was very volatile.

I’m simply looking for reputable companies where others have had good success.
I heard Fidelity and Vanguard are fine, when I searched those in my area they had awful reviews.

Appreciate any experiences/direction in advance!"

401k is traditional, have maybe 125k or 200k in it. Idk.  

I don't understand IRAs either or if I would even want to put more money in one. 

I probably won't set up a 401k plan for my employees for another year or so. We're an early vc-backed start up, so the retirement plan is their considerable equity in a fast growing company. The growth of the company has already outpaced the 401k by a lot. 

When I talk to advisors in person, they try to sell me life insurance and won't stop calling me. 

I don't want to manage things myself. 

Is there somewhere or someone I can give it to and forget about it? What's the point of putting more money into it if I have an investment (my business) that I believe will essentially double money every year for the next 3 years? 

Just lost and wondering if anyone else has insight. I know I'm blessed/privileged to be in the position, but it feels likes there isn't any material I can find on a google search that speaks to my situation.

Started with around 250k in 2022. Account is held in Schwab, value is about now $276k. (Dividends have been taken out quarterly (total taken out around $25k since 2022, will stop these and just re invest them).

Just wanted to share some exciting developments for Reddit investors and tech enthusiasts alike. Reddit's shares have seen a notable jump recently, and here's why:

AI Deals Boosting Share Price:

- Profitability at Last: Reddit has just reported its first profitable quarter ever, with a 68% increase in revenue YoY. This isn't just from ads; they've made smart moves by licensing their user-generated content for AI training.

- Google and OpenAI: Yes, you heard that right. Reddit has inked deals with tech giants like Google and OpenAI, essentially turning user posts into gold for AI model training. This isn't just good for Reddit's bottom line; it's positioning them at the forefront of AI integration in social media.

- User Base Expansion: Not only is Reddit making money, but they're also seeing a surge in daily active users. Their platform's growth seems to be fueled by these AI partnerships, perhaps through features like real-time translations or enhanced content discovery.

- Market Reaction: The financial markets have responded with enthusiasm. After Reddit's earnings beat expectations, shares reportedly jumped by up to 22%. Investors are clearly betting big on Reddit's AI strategy.


What This Means for Reddit:

- Future Revenue Streams: This could be just the beginning for Reddit. With more AI companies hungry for training data, Reddit's stock of user-generated content becomes increasingly valuable.

- Innovation in User Experience: The partnerships might lead to innovative features on Reddit, making it not just a place for discussion but a hub for cutting-edge tech experiences.

2024-10-30 00:40:28,r0aring_silence,When does it make sense to sell stocks at a loss for capital gains tax savings?,"I asked myself this question this morning as I purchased a stock for $160 initially, and now it is at $9 (gotta love inflated pandemic prices). My decision was whether to sell the stock now, and take advantage of tax savings from the capital loss, or whether to wait for possible price appreciation and sell at a future date. I believe this is a fairly common scenario investors find themselves in.

This led me to perform an analysis that I think would be generally useful for folks in this situation, namely where the price of a stock has fallen very significantly below it's original price. The proceeds I would make from the sale of 1 share of the stock today would be $9, however the capital gains tax savings would be ($160-$9)\*0.15 = $22.7. The tax savings in this scenario are much greater than the proceeds from sale of the stock.

If I wait and sell the stock in future years, any tax savings have to be discounted because of the time value of money. Similarly, the proceeds from the sale would have to be discounted. I performed an analysis assuming the stock price appreciates 30% every year to see if selling in future years would be better than selling now, in Year 0. Included it below with many assumptions:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ5kGw7oRw4Qike-adjVGS5zpaD6Xn3vZaRm3V751EuQNYHVMt3bokhkMFwiT8GZy32PPhqB-0ZHNsD/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ5kGw7oRw4Qike-adjVGS5zpaD6Xn3vZaRm3V751EuQNYHVMt3bokhkMFwiT8GZy32PPhqB-0ZHNsD/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true)

As you can see, I would have to wait *5 years* with yearly 30% price appreciation to make it worthwhile to wait instead of selling the stock now.

Out of curiousity, I calculated the stock price appreciation it would take to make it worth waiting to sell in Years 1 through 5. The appreciation needed, as shown in the table, ranges from 41% in Year 1 to 137% in Year 3 to 253% in Year 5.

So based on this simple analysis, I need to ask myself: ""do I think the price of this stock will appreciate by at least 41% in 1 year, or 137% in 3 years?"" If not, then I should just sell now and take the capital gains tax savings now.

I think this is quite a high bar for waiting - if I don't think the stock price will go up at rates significantly above market, then it makes sense to sell immediately. This applies when the stock price has dropped to very low levels relative to the price I purchased it (e.g., <10% of the purchase price).

The above analysis doesn't take into account strategies such as selling now and purchasing similar securities, but I believe these types of strategies would only add to the case for selling now at a loss.

This is a very simplified analysis with a lot of assumptions, but my goal was to get it directionally correct. Feel free to let me know your thoughts or point out any big things I missed.

In summary, when a stock price has dropped to levels that are significantly below my purchase price (e.g., <10%), it makes sense to sell now unless I think the stock will appreciate at rates that are significantly above market. This is because the capital gains tax savings are large relative to the proceeds I would get from the sale of the shares, and the time value of money makes it compelling to get these tax savings in the current year vs. in future years."

2024-11-01 07:46:58,Labrador421,Selling a profitable stock to offset a loss and buying it back immediately ,"I can’t seem to find the answer to this question and was hoping someone here would know. I have a stock that is doing terribly and I’m going to sell it for a rather large loss. I have another stock that is doing fantastically. If I sell the stock that is doing great, I will realize a gain that is just about equal to the loss that I will experience in the stock that is terrible. Can I sell the stock that is doing well just to realize the profit so that I can write it off against the loss, and then buy the great stock  back just about immediately? I have no intention of buying the losing stock back so it won’t trigger a wash sale."
2024-11-05 18:37:46,TangyApple680,Do I have too much in NVDA?,"So, my account is worth about 127k right now. I have it split up into 12 different stocks. 

Most of my stocks are in the tech sector, I have 5k in MU, INTC, Disney, HD, Nflx, up to 10k in META, FB, MSFT, AAPL, TSLA, and other large cap stocks.

Nvda exploded up and I have atleast 40k on them right now. It keeps gaining though so I don't sell it. But, I'm a little afraid I have to much in it. 

What do you think?"
2024-11-10 09:11:30,Ben280301,Best ETFs to avoid being to tech heavy ,"What are the best performing ETFs against too much tech exposure?

I’ve recently started investing and I’ve put 1000€ in CSPX and IUIT.

I have another 6000€ to invest and I’m planning on putting most in CSPX and IUIT with GOOGL, AMZN, ASTS and GSAT getting 5% each.

Now, I think that that is too much tech exposure so what are some good UCITS ETFs to diversify.

I'm not a professional trader, I just want to occasionally look up funds with certain annualized returns over a period of time, yields, expense ratios, alphas, Sharpe ratios, etc. while I'm out walking or lying on my couch. I'm using Schwab's screener on my laptop and it works fine, but I already spend enough time sitting down at a computer. I've tried searching Google Play for screener apps, but they're all aimed at traders and/or have a subscription fee that I can't justify paying. The Schwab mobile app unfortunately doesn't have a screener.

My definition of ""cheap"": Doesn't require a $5+ monthly fee for something I can do for free on my laptop. I'm not opposed to paying, especially if it's a one time purchase and the UI is great."
