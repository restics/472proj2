2023-11-20 04:55:19,Alternative-Bid-2760,Is it possible for an intraday strategy to beat 'buying and holding' TSLA,"Just for a bit of fun - the closest I managed to get was using Keltner Channels and SMA whilst keeping the drawdown to under 30%. first trade 2018.

2023-12-14 18:10:32,ImmediateAid4267,I don't understand the stock market... at all,Didn't tesla have an announcement yesturday that it had a mass recall on all of its vehicles. Also cyber truck sucks. why isn't the stock going down? How has it gone up 5%... maybe I am not meant for the trading world
2023-12-20 05:31:43,TearRepresentative56,20/12 I'm a professional trader and these are some of my notes from premarket.,"**I want to start this post by clarifying some of my comments in yesterdays post, and responding to some of the user comments there.**

* When I said the market looks like it can be topping out, I am in no way saying I am a bear, nor am I saying I am short on the market. This is the US stock market. Obviously, in the long run, it is ultimately going to go up, and break highs. To clarify, I am still long the market. What I was saying was that barring a catalyst, which it doesn’t appear there is in the near term, I do not see a sharp move higher. I am not saying the market cannot move 0.4% higher etc day to day. It can, especially when there is nothing on the economic calendar in way of headwinds. The market is moving on optimism and can continue to move in the direction it is, especially when VIX is so suppressed. What I am saying is that if you look at the economic calendar, there’s not much this side of the new year to help push it higher forcefully.Instead, when you look at certain factors which I will break down here, it seems likely there will be some short term correction, before it again moves higher.Firstly, Mag 7 trading near resistance, which it will have to break. E.g. NVDA rejected at 500. AAPL rejected at 200. Obviously a news story can break these resistances, but trading right against them, makes it more likely for them to come down than go up.Same can be said for indices, with SPX just below all time highs, which will probably act as a resistance.
* Secondly, look at market breadth. More than 90% of stocks are trading above their 50 day Moving average. This makes sense to be honest, when you consider the rate cut optimism. But at the same time, if you look at the last 3 instances that this has happened, in each of them, the market has done short term corrections. The last time that it was able to reach a level where market breadth was at 90% and still move higher was in 2021. To be honest, I do not see enough similarities in the economic picture today to in 2021 to suggest this will happen again now. Interest rates are much higher, economic growth is slowing, consumer is holding up but there’s still uncertainty as to how long it can.
* For this reason, I see it as more likely than not that there will be short term correction before it moves higher again.
* I am still long the market. We operate a long only fund, so we never short. What we do do, is fluctuate our cash position to reflect the headwinds and tailwinds in the market, or you can say, the risk/reward in the market. Right now, I have trimmed my positions, and have closed my swing trades/active trades. I still have my passive positions all running. To this end, if the market moves higher for whatever reason, and I am proved wrong, I am happy, because my passive positions are doing well. If it price corrects, I am also happy as I can put my swing trades back in and utilise my cash position. This is what trading is all about in our strategy, using the cash position to hedge ourselves such that we benefit if the market goes up, or comes down.
* *I will now continue with the normal posts:*

**What happened yesterday, and some of my trades from yesterday:**

* Was off the desk yesterday, due to family bereavement.
* From what I can see, market continued to push higher from open. SPX is now 0.6% below all time high, whilst DJI and Nasdaq closed at all time high.Dollar was lower, whilst bond yields were flat.
* Only order I placed was for a small day trade in ARRY, entering at 18, for 2.6% gain, after its rating was cut by analyst.
* My sell order on short term trade in AVAV also executed at 130.

&#x200B;

* ***Because I was off the desk yesterday specifically, I will insert a section here on general market conditions, for those who want a bit of a summary, those who don’t can skip.***
* Market breadth continues to increase. The QQQ Equal weight, which negates the heavy weighting of the Mag 7, has moved from 52 week low to 52 week high across last month and a half.40% of stocks on the S&P are now above 70 RSI
* Goldman Sachs custom indices of unprofitable and heavily shorted stocks up 12% in last week, which tells you people are short covering and continuing to move into those stocks which have potential to run up with rate cuts.
* Discretionary stocks now at their highest level of outperformance vs Staples since January 2022.
* Put interest still very low, traders are chasing not hedging.

**————— EARNINGS ————**

* FEDEX earnings: Was trading at 52 week highs going into the print, up around 20% from last earnings, which puts pressure on the earnings being good.
* EPS of 3.99 missed estimates by 5%Revenue of 22.2b was down 3% yoy, and missed estimates by 1%Express Revenue still not picked up in last 4 quarters.
* Continues to see less shipments. Package volume down YOY. Perhaps less benefit from the UPS strikes than expected. Bit disappointing.Continuing on efficiency and cost reduction program (DRIVE). Cost reductions of $1.8bTo this end, cost per packaging declined 2%, due to lower line haul expense, and better last mile productivity.Demand remains uncertainBuybacks on stock of $1b in FY 2024
* Guidance:Cut full year revenue guidance - to fall single digit %, vs previous outlook of flatEPS guidance fell short at 17.75 at midpoint, miss consensus by 3%
* Conclusion:Yes margins expanded on lower revenues to help bottom line, but operating margin still fell short of expectations. Package volume decline showed limited benefit from UPS strikesNot enough has improved at all to justify how high it is trading.
* Overall, 5/10. Not terrible, but not good enough vs where its trading. Actually cut full year guidance, vs last quarter, when stock price is 20% higher.

**————— DATA LEDE —————**

* **JAPANESE BALANCE OF TRADE DATA -** Imports fell more than expected, whilst exports were more or less flat.
* This in theory should prop up the Yen as less imports means less selling of JPY. Seems to align with when Yen started going up last night, although the move is partly price correction from yesterday’s drop.
* **UK CPI (Nov) -** As noted in my Sunday post, I expected it to come in soft in line with US, and other European peers. GBP to fall slightly.
* This proved correct, as it came in well below expectations at 3.9% vs 4.4% expected.Core also fell to 5.1% vs 5.6% expected. Lowest core reading and headline reading in more than 2 years.
* MOM move was deflationary.
* This result is good for UK economy. Whilst Bailey at last meeting was signalling higher for longer, and UK and US situations are different, this datapoint shows that UK are starting to catch US up on inflation fighting front. May see rate cuts sooner than expected in UK.GBP falls on this, as it signals BOE can maybe move more dovish than before.
* **US - Consumer Confidence (Dec)** \- After market open, so hold early trading in anticipation of this.
* **US - 20 year bond auction**. Can move bond yields which can influence markets. Likely will see decent demand which will keep bond yields lower.

**———— FOREX ————**

* GBP moves lower on soft inflation numbers, which suggests BOE may be able to be more dovish than first thought.
* Yen doing some price correction after yesterday’s move lower. Also moving higher as Japan plans to issue more government bonds in 2024, increased demand for Yen.EUR lower slightly, in sentiment with GBP
* Note: Am holding GBPUSD as I believe that the BOE will hold rates higher than the Fed. Today’s inflation surprise does bring that into question a bit, but still think BOE will be more hawkish than Fed. I had trimmed a tiny bit ahead of the inflation print, so will put that back in soon.

**——— MARKETS —————**

* DJI hit new all time highs in premarket again, near 37,600 then pared gain as European markets sold off after open.
* SPX and NASDAQ similar story. Mostly flat in premarket. We expect this to continue, as barely any news catalysts around, VIX is suppressed, and GEX is very high which tells us volatility will be lower.
* GERMAN market quite flat, rejected at 16,800 today.
* UK at 3 month high following inflation data which fuelled rate cut bets.
* NIKKEI higher again on dovish BOJ yesterday as they signal ultra easy monetary to continue
* HKG50 opened higher, around 16,750 then sold off the gains, down 0.77%
* Oil moving higher by 1% in premarket. Continues higher on Red Sea complications. According to the downtrend I have drawn, which I think it will eventually break to the upside, oil is now close to the top of the downtrend, and may on a technical analysis basis do some correction here. My near term price target for oil overall is 80 though.
* Bond yields slightly lower in premarket today, which can support equities. But it’s only marginally lower so likely to have no impact.  10y lowest since July

**————— OPTIONS ————**

* GEX continues to grow - which lowers volatility4800 still sticky strike. 0dte tells us this is likely to be the max range today.HVL at 4645, 2.3% below spot.

**————  INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ————**

* Didn’t read too much as was off the desk yesterday. Here’s what I did read.
* DataTrek review 30 day rolling correlations of Daily returns on SPX vs individual large cap sectors, to suggest that the current rally has around 1-2 weeks left to run. They suggested that past that, market optimism would have pushed too far too fast.
* Bank of America’s fund manger survey yesterday showed equities saw largest inflow since October 2022. Tech saw the biggest inflows, industrials saw the biggest outflows. Dont; take too much notice of this inflows/outflows news. Ultimately, Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 9 straight days of gains.
* Bank of America also put out a piece saying that although credit card delinquencies have risen sharply over the last year, households on average remain flush with liquid assets. This is something we knew as Black Friday sales showed increase in Buy now pay later.
* Societe Generale: Market finds it easier to price monetary policy impact (rate cuts) than impact of inflation trends on margins. Last year, they misplaced hikes, vs impact of inflation on profits. For 2024, could be the other way around. AKA they are saying markets are probably pricing too much cuts.
* Unicredit - “Current enthusiasm seems somewhat exaggerated from short term perspective, and setback is highly likely”. Positives are priced in.

**——MAG 7 NEWS ( CAN MOVE MARKETS) ——**

* Generally flat, so the headlines outlined below are not considered big enough to have a market moving impact.
* **AAPL** \- financial impact of the smartphone ban not likely to be as severe as some first thought. Dan Ives estimates it to be about a $400m impact to sales over Holiday period. Is a drop vs their revenue.
* **GOOGL** \- plans to reorganise a big part of its 30,000 person ad sales unit.
* **TESLA** \- Reuters report that Tesla blamed drivers for failure of parts it knew were defective.
* **TSLA** \- VW has signed an agreement with Tesla to adopt North American Charging standard from 2025.
* **TESLA** \- will skip yearly media based employee stock awards
* **TESLA** \- Analysts at JL Warren Capital say that Tesla cut their prices for their EV cars in China by more than BYD did for its flagship car. Potentially more margin risk for Tesla.
* **META** \- CEO Zuckerberg just sold another chunk of FB shares. Has sold $320m in shares in last few days

**——— COMPANY SPECIFIC —————**

* **BABA** \- CEO Eddie Wu will lead Taaobao and T-Mall business in latest reshuffle
* **LUV** \- Southwest and Pilots union reach labour deal.
* **XPEV** \- BABA slashes their stake in Xpeng for 2nd time this month
* **NIO** and **Li** moving in sentiment with Xpeng. Chinese stocks generally all lower.
* **UPS** lower in sympathy with FEDEX earnings
* **CHH** \- pushing ahead on regulatory process for Wyndham takeover
* **DOCU** \- Wells Fargo downgrades to underweight
* **Lowe’s** \- cut to hold from buy by Stifel
* **S** \- Wells Fargo keeps hold rating on S
* **ENS** moving higher on earnings after they raised their Q3 profit outlook (need to read this report in full later)
* **TENB** \- higher on Buy rating by Wells Fargo
* **Oil** stocks generally higher on Oil prices being up 1%
* THERE WILL BE MORE COMPANY SPECIFIC NEWS NEARER THE MARKET OPEN. THIS WAS WRITTEN A COUPLE OF HOURS BEFORE

2023-12-21 05:45:30,TearRepresentative56,I'm a professional (news driven) trader and these are some of my notes from premarket,"  
**What happened yesterday, and my thoughts:**  


* Yesterday, we saw the market start to do a little correction. There wasn’t much news behind the move, except for the fact that VIX options expired, and QQQ failed to break the Call resistance 0DTE at 410. This may have contributed as VIX options had been suppressing VIX till now, and the expiration reset the options positioning a little. As such, VIX moved higher rapidly from 12.5 to 14. For the most part though, this was just normal mean reversion.   

* Markets have been at all time highs, up 16% on SPX since October lows, with 90% of stocks above their 50 day moving average. The market had just become a little too stretched, and needed to breathe. 
* Note that this is of course a very small correction in the scale of the move the market has just done, and is very healthy. Moving indefinitely higher is what’s not healthy. The market has to absorb and digest that move, before moving higher again. In premarket already, we can see the market already start to pare the drop. Over the next few days we will see volume dry up a little going into the Xmas break, and there isn’t much on the economic calendar in the way of major catalysts. With lower volume, we may see markets trade flat, or we can see exacerbated moves in either direction. With little on the economic calendar, it’s hard to guess exactly which way markets will move on a day to day basis. E..g markets are up in premarket, but this can easily fade to retest 4700 at least. On the whole, markets are still stretched despite the 500 point drop on the Dow, but this isn’t to say that today will be red. I caution against making day to day predictions because people call me up if they are in any way wrong. Look, we as investors aren’t fortune tellers, especially when there’s little on the economic calendar to guide us. We can only assess the overall state of the market, to determine risk reward. As readers had noted, I had left my passive positions running (trimmed a bit) and had sold all my active/swing trades, to build cash, because I suspected a near term small correction. I didn’t put the cash into the market yesterday. The dip happened so close to the close that why would I put it in just before, when I have no idea how markets will open tomorrow, especially with little particularly in premarket in way of economic news? The correction, whilst sudden, was still small. So personally, I am waiting to see more before I put the money I had trimmed, back into the market. If it moves higher form here, which premarket points to (although premarket movement means little), I will still be happy as my passive positions make money.   


**My Trades:**

* (Explaining trades I made in my personal portfolio. People have mentioned rightly not to share too much details about company work, so I have shared trades I was executing in my personal port instead)  

* In terms of what I did yesterday, I explained in yesterday’s post that oil was trading at the top of the downward channel that had been forming. I thought it could easily get rejected there, so I trimmed half my oil positions, and left half running. My price target on oil is 80, so I left some going to meet that, but knew that this could easily get rejected at the top of that channel, so took some out. Technical analysis suggests it can even move lower to 67 now, although you’d have to see a move higher in dollar for that to happen.   

* I also trimmed my enphase position because I was off the desk the day before. Note: I still have some running. I also have positions in FSLR and ARRY. I am bullish on solar still for next year. The reason why I sold some was because I was holding form 80. It was up a lot, and whilst interest rate cuts will help them a lot next year, it doesnt immediately change their near term earnings, which were guided last quarter to be terrible. A 62% move higher in quick time was good enough for me to take some profits here. 

————  
**TODAY’S DATA LEDE/MACRO EVENTS:**  


* **UK CBI Trades data:**
* One of the less important metrics for the Uk, but does give some telling insight, especially because it was such a miss to the downside. Came out -32 vs forecast of -14. It’s a leading indicator of retail performance, so signals a weakening retail sector in UK. (Little impact in GBPUSD because it is a small indicator)  

* **US GDP Final Revision (Q3) - Expected to remain above 5%**  
PCE revisions too
* note: these are both revisions, and barring a big surprise, won’t move markets too much as should be confirming previous readings.   

* **US Jobless Claims**  
————

**INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH**  


* Evercore says that they see a big pullback in first half of 2024, as recession “materialises”.   

* Goldman put out a piece where they compared the performance of small caps vs large caps in various markets over the last 12 months. There, they concluded that smalls have only outperformed large in emerging markets. Other than it, in Japan, Europe, US and others, they have underperformed large caps. This is something we all mostly knew anyway, since Mag7 led the rally most of the year. I suppose for those that don’t follow other markets, it’s interesting to know this was the case in other markets too.   

* Goldman put out another piece looking at average inflation across G10 economies. They estimated that across them, core inflation ran at just 2.2% over past 3 months and 1.3% in November alone.   

* Hedge funds net long positions on crude hit record low going back to 2011.   

* Fitch says they expect their next moves from the Fed, ECB and BOE to be cuts - no sh\*t Sherlock. No more hikes from here.   

* Interesting fact: Statista shows that international tourism finally reaches pre pandemic level.

**FOREX**  


* GBP was lower yesterday after soft CPI print and continued slightly lower today. Trading 1.265. Note: I hold position in GBPUSD  

* USDJPY continues doing correction as yen moves higher. This is correction after Yen sell off following BOJ dovishness. Note, can bounce off of 142.59. Then again, can not. Depends on initial jobless claims numbers as they can move the dollar.    

* AUD moving higher again.   
————— 

**MARKETS**   


* SPX: Sold off yesterday a bit back to 4700. Held that level in aftermarket, and pared losses to 4722. ( up 0.5% from lows of yesterday)  

* Nasdaq: Fell to 16,550 yesterday, pared some of those losses in premarket, up 0.7% in premarket from the lows.    

* GER40 tracked the sell off in US overnight. Was relatively flat since.   

* HKG: Opened much lower, after US sell off. Recovered 1.6% from there. Basically pushed up right from the open. Partly due to China economic stimulus measure announcements e.g. cutting deposit rate  

* OIL: Failed to break out of downward channel yesterday. Still testing it in premarket. Needs to close above 75 on daily to break out.   

* VIX: pushed up after expiration. Now at 13 handle.   

* Bond yields slightly higher today, probably as sellers take from bonds into equities.

2023-12-26 14:06:19,crystal_castle00,Why is TSLA so popular?,"Someone asked me a good question this morning: Why is trading Tesla so popular? It’s one of the most (if not the most) popular retail trading stocks. Always has killer premarket volume, great morning volatility. 

Is it simply by chance, because something has to be popular, and this is where everyone inadvertently came together? What do you think."
2023-12-28 14:53:59,InvWithRed,How do you manage risk pre-market?,"Hi! My name is !\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*! and I am a Dumb Ass Day Trader! I started trading around July of this year after paper trading for a month. I lost about $16K over 3 months. I stopped and paper traded for a month in November, then traded starting December 4th and had no red days - until today! Then I lost over $24K! I mostly trade pre-market - how can you do a stop loss? It seems like you can only enter in limit orders pre-market. Just wondering how everyone handles it. And yes, I do have a problem or 2 - I was up about $300 this morning at 7:04 and I said ""Oh look, it is still going up!"" Of course, it was already up over 100% from the close yesterday and up like 200% pre-market - I shouldn't have gone anywhere near it!

Thanks!

2024-01-11 11:02:49,Sketch_x,Any ideas why my TradingView TSLA (NASDEQ) isnt matching my brokers price action? (its not spread..) I was stopped out of a trade due to this,
2024-01-19 09:17:59,helipad668,In 2 yrs I blew up 20 small accounts,"All from put options from SPY QQQ and TSLA, never had a single loss from calls… 

Puts are the absolute worst way to make money, it is extremely difficult if you don’t time your puts correctly, I have closed my eyes and randomly bought calls and made profit multiple time. No strategy required just buy calls when SPY or QQQ goes down and it always bounces, works best with 0dte 

I have bought puts at the top overbought levels and it just keeps pumping away, I have never seen SPY goes down and not have a bounce, calls = free money

TLDR fuck put options

Sorry for the angry rant

Edit: Today was a PERFECT example of what I’m talking about, it was going up with ZERO pullbacks, anywhere you got puts you would get your head taken off unless you timed your puts perfectly and took profits immediately, I’ve never seen SPY goes down the same way without some sort of bounce before going back down even during the 2022 bear market

Just go on Stocktwits and see how many blew up their account buying puts on QQQ NVDA

I’ve read all the positive helpful comments and took notes"
2024-01-30 09:38:12,CryptographerOk4571,Whats wrong with not selling at a loss if you have a good stock,"So, since i started trading stocks, mostly blue chips such as tsla, amd, tqqq etc. I have been not honoring my stop losses, because my theory is even if my current thesis turned out to be wrong,  eventually my underlying will recover at some point, if not today than maybe tomorrow. So far this has not caused me any loss, as i just hold out until it recovers. The only problem is that i might have to hold it overnight, or a day or two, so it ends up becoming a swing trade.

With options i do understand you have to sell out immediately if your thesis doesnt play out because of expiration, and theta decay etc. But whats wrong if i buy 30k worth of tesla, and when i was hoping for it to go up, it instead goes down. It will eventually recover right? What is wrong with this strategy?

Even today i bought tqqq when rsi was low and price was below all indicators. I was waiting for recovery after buying but it didnt happen and it has been chopping and even down a little since i bought it 45 mins ago. But eventually it will recover, and then i can sell it at a profit "
2024-02-08 19:53:01,AlanTrades,Tsla TA input,Is it just me or is this thing about to breakout?
2024-02-12 06:26:14,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is a complete report of everything I read and analysed from premarket 02/12 to inform your trading today.,"**Analysis**:

* Today looks like a relatively light day in terms of macro releases and news. This is pretty much reflected in how flat premarket has been, around the levels it closed on Friday. 
* Let’s get into positioning then: 
* &#x200B;
* On SPX, the call interest is surging on SPX at 5050 and 5100, following the break of 5000 on Friday. The market looks like it is extending the bets on the market going higher from here. The images below compare the option positioning on Thursday close vs Friday close. See a lot more developing over 5000.

* This chart shows all expirations. If we look at some near term expirations, we can see that the call resistance has rolled up to 5030. This is a bullish sign. We are not really seeing much activity here on the downside to suggest any worry of an immediate correction. 
* 5030 level looks like it could be a key level today, but watch the levels to watch section below  
  [https://imgur.com/a/XLxpVBl](https://imgur.com/a/XLxpVBl)   
   
 the Gex is very positive right now. We are quite far above the HVL. This tells us that mosts likely, since we are in such positive gamma, the volatility will be suppressed today. 
* Skew is actually pointing slightly lower, but it’s no big deal, it’s just because futures are flat. block flows are very strong, and continue to increase. 
* Traders are starting to hedge the market, buying OTM puts, but the positioning still bullish, just increasingly cautious.   
 
* If we look at QQQ then, we had SPX hit 5k on Friday, but the market is still watching to see QQQ hit 440. That is a VERY sticky strike. We see a LOT of call interest on it, and IV OI. I’d expect it to hit this week, particularly if some of the macro data supports it.  
 
* We can see the positioning in the images below:  
 
* [https://imgur.com/a/LyaRLVJ](https://imgur.com/a/LyaRLVJ)  
 
* Note that QQQ tracks Nasdaq (NDX), which is currently trading at 17,956. Watch 18k level. The market will probably face some resistance there and we will need to see stronger volume for it to break. 18k is also the Call resistance. So whilst you may watch QQQ, you should also be watching this level on NDX. 
* Look at one thing here: mag7 Skew. This is the skew but concentrated on just the Mag 7.
* Moving higher again, at ATH. Traders don’t expect any issues for the big firms. Expected to carry the market higher. 
* Let’s take a look at some FX ahead of the week:
* AS mentioned in the report yesterday, ahead of CPI, risk reversal in USD is pointing lower. Traders are not particularly concerned about the CPI and PPI and expect ti to come in soft or in line. 
* We can see this bearish divergence here, clearly. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/prrhrjB](https://imgur.com/a/prrhrjB)
* For individual currency pairs, EURUSD and GBPUSD, for both, risk reversal is pointing higher. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/NZXurdQ](https://imgur.com/a/NZXurdQ)
* A quick look at NVDa then, which is up again in premarket. 
* What we are seeing here is basically a continued squeeze. Skew points higher again, hits a new high. This comes as IV in OTM puts drop. BASically, bears keep trying to predict and short the pullback, but then as it moves higher, they continue to get squeezed and rush to cover their positions. This is moving NVDA higher in a parabolic way. If you are bearish on NVDA, it seems you need to just watch and wait rather than trying to guess the top.

**Levels to watch: (plot these on your charting platform as it will help you to analyse intraday price action).**   
 

* SPX currently trading at 5025.
* One key level will be the 0dte Call resistance which is now at 5030. 
* Note the all expiration call resistance remains at 5000, which will create some support there. 
* Other key levels for gamma are 5050 and 5015. 
* My quant says the max trading range for today is 5059.
* I doubt we hit that high, probs get stoped around 5030-5035. Let’s see
* Quant says minimum of expected trading bound is 4994 ish. 
* QQQ:
* Like I said, watch 18k level on NDX. This translated to around 438.4 on QQQ
* Call resistance for QQQ is 440. I doubt we move higher than that today as there’s not much news. 
* Key gamma levels to watch are 435 and 437. 
* Quant says min of day trading range will be 433 and max of the day trading range is 441.   
 I think we trade well within that range, as traders don’t want to make big moves before CPI. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* Nothing particularly significant on the economic calendar for today. No big data releases. 
* We do have some fedspeak later, as Bowman speaks, as does Kashkari. 
* For the UK, Governor Bailey will be speaking. He probably reiterates the data driven approach for BoE and that its too early for cuts. After the last BoE meeting, markets trimmed bets on BOE rate cuts slightly, pricing 107 BPS in 2024, from 111 before.

**INSTIUTITIONAL RESEARCH:**

* An interesting piece here from Goldman Sachs: They have put out a note telling their clients to get out of parabolic tech. Said Everyone Is In The Same Trades And All-In”. Went ton to say that this is the Best Start Of The Year Ever For Momentum, But ""You Don't Want To Be On The Wrong Side During A Momentum Crash”.
* A quote from a Goldman Sachs paper, where they compare the state of the stock market today, to the 2000 Dot com bubble: “At this point, valuations at the top are no where near as frothy as they were at the height of the Dot Com Bubble. The 5 largest stocks traded at 43x Fwd PE in March ‘00, a 59% premium to the Mag 7’s current multiple of 27x.""  
 
* We see this demonstrated in the table below:
* [https://imgur.com/a/fUdSFMa](https://imgur.com/a/fUdSFMa) 
* Bank of America say that they can see potential for the outperformance of small cap this year. They said that the factors that are supportive of this in 2024, include bottoming profits, historically attractive valuations (29% discount to large), improving market breadth, a Fed cutting cycle and inflecting macro indicators that are correlated with relative performance.
* Global gold outflows continued in January, dragging Gold price lower, shows Bloomberg. 

**MARKETS:**

* SPX: Closed Friday at 5026. In premarket, been trading in such a narrow range. Basically flat. 
* NASDAQ: Trading flat at 17,965. Watch the technical level of 18k today. Market will be trying to break it, may temporarily intraday, but this is the key level to watch as will need significant volume for Nasdaq to close above it. 
* DJI: Flat in premarket at 37,650. 
* GER40: Has been trying to break 17k level. Got a big push at 9am when market opened, right up to the 17k level. 
* Hong Kong Market closed for national holiday. 
* Chinese market slightly higher, trading at 11,430
* OIL: Got rejected at 77 on Friday. Trading slightly lower today, at 76. OIL IS SLIGHTLY LOWER Mostly as price correction from last week, but also AS ISRAEL SAYS IT HAD CONCLUDED A SERIES OF STRIEKS IN SOUTHERN GAZA, somewhat easing concerns of supply risk. Strikes continue in Gaza though, as Gaza officials say airstrikes kill 67. 
* Bonds: Opened higher today, then moved lower.  

**FOREX:**

* JPY higher ahead of PPI later today. Risk reversal on JPY points lower. Traders are expecting that due to a hesitant BOJ to tighten, and no certainty on wage inflation, that JPY will underperform. 
* Dollar more or less stable right now, slightly higher, after got a bit of a push when European market opened. 
* EURUSD slightly lower, came to 1.08 then bounced down as found resistance and no big volume from the macro data to drive it higher. This was all technicals. 
* GBPUSD following lwoer.
* AUDUSD opened slightly lwoer, then moved higher. 
* Not much news driving FX movement this morning. Just usual price action. 
* NZD lower on comments from NZRB governor who said that inflation ate was still too high at 4.7%. Whilst hawkish, there was some repricing, NZD has been up recently on expectations of RBNZ to hike again.

2024-02-17 12:18:59,Gl_drink_0117,Quick taking loss,"I have made some good money off SMCI and penny stocks like BMR/MGIH. However, I face two probably mental issues that I need to work on to become more consistent.

I have become consistent in quickly taking profits as the stock moves. But not the other way around.

Issue#1: I am trying to catch them as they move up but many a time they just get shorted right after they move up. This is for eg I get in after 2-3 green candles after some consolidation above VWAP and turns out it was a fake out and it was maybe a second or third attempt to break a resistance. Do you always wait for it to break the resistance and hold before getting in? I have seen Ross Cameron also sometimes does this too but he bails out quickly if going down. Questions on this later.

Issue#2: Now that such above trades go against me, I get stuck thinking it will recover and I don’t want to take the loss. More often than not they recover and I am green. It’s those last ones where they don’t recover and I am stuck holding them for ever as now the loss is a mountain more than what I made of them. Same happened with me for all the 3 stocks SMCI, BMR and MGIH. How do you train your brain for taking quick losses if the trade goes against you? Does paper trading help to train the brain and what other things have you used to train your brain? Haven’t done too much of it yet. 

How is Webull windows desktop paper trading? 

Now in case of Ross, he uses mental stops during premarket and his hot key is programmed to close position. Probably his system knows of the bids and places sell orders at the bids automatically until all his positions are closed and he probably trades only one stock at anytime. Do you know if WeBull desktop hotkeys can be setup to specifically do this for stocks traded during the current day? (I have other current negative positions like TSLA/AMD which I wouldn’t want to close)

Would appreciate if some of you been there can throw in your advices."
2024-02-20 20:57:17,13sonic,"For scalpers out there, which market brings in the most profits for you?","I've seen folks trading in the regular stock market but that would require large capital. 
So far the most profitable I've seen are in the Options, Futures and Forex markets. Someone told me the best is to trade futures when scalping due to volume, volatility. I guess that would also be the riskiest. 
Anybody out there disagree or Agree? "
2024-02-21 06:31:19,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket 02/21,"**ANALYSIS:**

* Firstly, NVDA earnings are today. 
* Bloomberg is showing an 11% predicted volatility on earnings, as shown below. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/C1nuTr6](https://imgur.com/a/C1nuTr6)  
* NVDA is lower in premarket on continued profit taking, but we can notice a few things. Firstly, skew, which was pointing sharply lower has now reversed upwards, as IV in OTM calls increases. 680 was a key gamma level where traders tried to buy the dip from yesterday.   
 As we know earnigns are a risk. Earnigns when the stock is up 50% in the last quarter are an even bigger risk. We saw that in other earnings reports, like Google’s where good earnings were still punished based on valuation. 
* Bulls on NVDA are for the most part holding their positions.
* This is the net gex profile for NVDA, skewed mostly to calls still on all expirations. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/IlFyzTE](https://imgur.com/a/IlFyzTE) 
* On the 1 week to expirations, we can see more hedging for the earnigns. This clears up and the profile is again biased to calls when you look at monthly expirations. So traders hedge into earnings s that makes sense, but outlook still bullish. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/hzs6fu8](https://imgur.com/a/hzs6fu8) 
* Key levels for NVDA are:
* Call resistance at 700, although lots of calls on 750 too
* Put support is at 640
* Put support from 0dte options is at 650
* These will be key levels going into the earnigns print. 

——

* China points higher today as markets react to the cutting of 5 year rate yesterday. We noted on weekend that it seemed skew for Hong Kong was pointing higher and we could see calls building on 17k. It seems that traders are still expecting 17k to hit. 

A look at Oil:

* Spot price falls at the moment, as volatility continues as traders buy ATM puts to hedge for volatility.
* However, we can see from skew that there is a bullish divergence there on Brent. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/xtjaHfa](https://imgur.com/a/xtjaHfa) 
* Volatility continues due to the hedging and the evercahgning geopolitical landscape, as well as ever changing Fed expectations. 
* But overall, outlook still looks bullish. 

A look at BTC\\

* Looks like we can be seeing a local top here. IV in OTM calls is reducing, block trade flows also reduce. Skew points lower. May see some correction. 

A quick look at indices then:

* Volatility skew does point down as traders hedging with put options, but money flows from hedge funds hit new high yesterday. Funds are buying the dip, and not expecting it to last in medium term. A lot in the short term will depend on NVDA though. 
* Finally, if we look at Mag7 skew, we do see signs that market can continue to price correct. 
* We see Mag7 skew lower, which often leads the market. Traders are seeking some protection from the volatility in short term. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* KEY IS FOMC MINUTES WHICH IS RELEASED 2 HOURS BEFORE MARKET CLOSE. 
* Japan tankan business survey gives first negative reading on business sentiment since April 2023. 
* Japan Balance of Trade Numbers:
* Overall balance of trade was less negative than expected. 
* Exports grew more than expected up 12% YOY, ahead of expectations of 9.5%
* Imports fell more than expected, by 9.6% vs 8.4% expected.
* This means more exports and less imports, points to greater demand for JPY. Would expect JPY to rise on this. But JPY down on Japanese gov downgrades and business survey weakness. 
* Australia Wage Price index:FASTEST PACE OF RISE In 15 YEARS. 
* YOY comes 4.2% vs 4.1% forecast. Last quarter’s data revised up to 4.1% from 4%.
* QOQ comes 0.9% vs 0.9% forecast. 
* Hotter than expected wage data points to stickier service inflation and thus, a more hawkish RBA. 
* UK Record budget surplus for January:
* UK Chief secretary says that they still won’t speculate if tax cuts are affordable or not in the budget. 
* US mortgage demand numbers:
* Mortgage demand takes a hit, interest rates cross back over 7% on reduced rate cut expectations pushing up bond yields. 
* EU Consumer Confidence NUmbers:
* Later we have FOMC minutes - likely reveals more of what we know, continue to explain that we need to see more of the same data to be confident of cuts. Slight hawkish tone probably. 
* FED SPEAKERS: BOSTIC speaks, as does Bowman. 

**MARKETS:**

* SPX - yesterday, found support around 4955, before recovering back to 4977. Before Europe opened, was trading at 4972, dropped slightly on European open as FTSE100 sold off. 
* Nasdaq: Slightly lags SPX and DJI. This is due to the big sell off in PANW. Low of day yesterday was 17,400, before recovery to 17,550. Lower in premarket,. 
* DJI - Trading at around 38,500 in premarket, slightly down, at the low of the day from yesterday. 
* HKG market higher today on cutting of loan prime rate. Was up almost 4%, as high as 16,800, before paring some gain to 16,460. 
* China meanwhile is up 2% to 11,890. Key level here will be the 12k level, which it was rejected off of. 
* GER40: low of yday was 17,020. Trading quite flat. Today got a bit of a boost at open and is up 0.42% to 17062. This comes as we are seeing higher open interest on 17.5k
* UK market down 1%
* Gold higher again on softer dollar and Middle East geopolitics - 5th consecutive green day in a row. 
* OIL: down 0.8%. Little bit of correction here, as was trading 78.5 yesterday. Volatility is persistent but skew keeps higher, just with more hedging. 
* Bond yields slightly lower ahead of FOMC minutes later. 

**FOREX:**

* AUD was higher on hawkish wage data. 
* Dollar was lower into the FOMC minutes, pared slightly. 
* EURUSD and GBPUSD slightly lower back to 1.08. 
* GBPUSD fell and retested 1.26. 
* AUDUSD pushing up towards 0.66 but pared the gains. 
* USDJPY steady around 150

I pulled gap fill data on TSLA by weekday for the past 6 months and found that when the stock gapped up on Friday's, it usually filled the gap 92% of the time.

what's even more interesting is that even when the stock gapped down, it filled 77% of the time.

you can use this report to estimate how price will move on Friday's based on how its moved historically."
2024-03-06 05:40:37,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing from premarket after market sold off yesterday,"**ANALYSIS:**

* We do have a few volatile events today. Firstly the ADP jobs numbers, which are expected to come in hotter than last month, whilst Powell talks in his testimony infant of Congress. 
* I think Powell’s talk will be important, but probably not the impact some may fear, as if you look historically at when Powell testifies, not as much movement as other speeches by Powell. Only thing I worry about is the fact that inflation ticked higher last month and could tick higher again this month if you look at Euro inflation reports for Feb as a guide. This could make Powel more hawkish than before. Still, Powell is generally v candid with his words so I’m not sure he will say anything which kills the market, but let’s see. 
* Regardless, if we look at risk reversal on DXY, we see it widen as traders continue to expect dollar to fall in medium term.
* Traders are mostly long GBPUSD, and very short USDJPY. LEt’s see. 
* EURUSD they are long as well, but less so. Let’s see. Moving towards 1.09 which is trader target but may see rejection there. 
* Regarding price movement yesterday, we saw a squeeze as traders very short volatility, which was triggered by bad news around TESla and AAPl. 
* This moved VIX much higher to 15, which led to QQQ sell off.
* Was. Bigger sell off than I anticipated, but signs of a major pullback still not there.
* Traders still very short vol, and we saw them sell it off towards end of the day, and today, VIX is lwoer at 14. 
* Yesterday was likely a buying opportunity rather than a major negative event. 
* We can get volatility from JOLTS today, they tend to be volatile for the market, but still no major signs of pullback. 
* Institutional money flow on SPY not pulling back one bit. THeyre still long. 
* On oil we can expect a bit more sideways movement below 80, as volatility skew quite flat, but I think fundamentals support move back to 80 on WTI as producers look to extend cuts to supply.

DATA LEDE:

* South Korea Inflation rate comes hot, at 3.1% vs 2.9% expected. Above previous reading of 2.8%
* MOM was hot 0.5% vs 0.4% expected
* Aus GDP (Q4) - Comes stronger than expected, at 1.5% YOY growth rate, vs 1.4% expected. Previous reading was 2.1%
* So it slowed vs last month, but beat expectations. 
* GERMAN exports and imports both beat expectation
* Exports MOM came 6.3% Up, vs expectations of 1.5% increase
* Imports were 3.6% up, vs expectations of 1.8% increase
* This points to improving domestic demand and international demand, although is one data point. 
* Eurozone Retail Sales (Jan)
* Retail sales were down 1% YOY, better than expectations of a -1.3% decline.
* MOM retail sales were more or less in line.
* So still declining YOY. This has been the case for more than a year. Not great, but in line with expectations. 
* ADP Employment Chnge (Feb) - Expected to have grown to 150k jobs placed according to official consensus. 
* POWELL TESTIMONY
* JOLTS (Jan) - has been a volatile one for market reaction for intraday trading, so look out for this one.

2024-03-18 08:57:34,littleseaturtles,Opinions on reason for sell off at the open? (TSLA),"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kwtzofkz44pc1.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=bec73c354a173df98393900f13abf1501082b734

Not saying it's unusual or anything I just want learn everything I can for this specific days price action at open incase there's something I'm missing. Is this typical when there's a big move premarket? Is there a profit taking factor? Or is it more prominently that it broke through an important level (the red line $166 resistance) and has a tendency to retrace to that level? Appreciate any feedback"
2024-03-18 18:21:32,CarbonKLR,Tsla long opportunity ,Just look at the hammer on this thing!
2024-03-20 05:16:32,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket ahead of FOMC meeting today.,"**ANALYSIS:**

* Yesterday, we saw an early dip in the equity markets as SPX touched 5123, and QQQ touched 433.
* However, as mentioned in the premarket report and continually mentioned in my commentaries, traders remain incredibly short volatility. 
* AS such, that created the usual vix crush as we see here, with VIX dropping below 13.
* [https://imgur.com/a/KfchMYf](https://imgur.com/a/KfchMYf) 
* This fuelled market makers to add liquidity, which led to the usual intraday recovery back to 5180 and 438.5. 
* Today, we have the FOMC meeting which will be the key focus, as will the updated dot plot which will be released. 
* We are seeing low volume in options ahead of this, as traders are basically waiting for it. 
* On January and February CPI coming in ahead of expectations, and with Shelter and Core inflation remaining very sticky, there is some likely expectation that Powell will be less dovish. 
* I think that’s probably true, he will be more hawkish, but it appears traders are not expecting him to be outright hawkish as such. 
* Probably more neutral, pointing to the fact that inflation is coming down, and will affirm their intention to continue bringing inflation down. He will probably continue to say that they just need to see more of the same before moving to cutting. More of the usual data dependence commentary, but with hints that cuts will still be on the table. 
* Credit Default swaps don’t show any signs of major alarm, and continue to head lower. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/PTPNoBo](https://imgur.com/a/PTPNoBo) 
* Traders are hedging into today’s meeting. Dollar is increasing in premarket. Nonetheless, traders remain very short volatility still. Inflation swaps are still pricing inflation to come down later in the year, even if it appears that it is stuck for now. 
* I think that off the back of this, we do probably see dollar increase, hence why I haven’t averaged my positions against USD today and averaged with very little size yesterday. Looking at the equity market, we probably see some volatility, and a dip, but vol will probably crush again, so any VIX spike probably won’t last long, which should again fuel market makers to add liquidity to aid the recovery (not necessarily same day recovery, but short term nonetheless). 
* On next monthly expiry, we have seen 5300 accumulate gex quite a bit recently, so traders are still looking higher, but hedge for some volatility.
* As mentioned previously, we can see traders open puts inr response to a possible hawkish Powell, and then get squeezed again and forced to short cover, as we have seen repeatedly over the course of this rally, and as we saw on Monday. Shorting probably not the way forward as traders are still bullish on medium expiries. 

**DATA LEDE**

* China maintain their loan prime rate for 1 year and 5 year at current rates
* UK INFLATION
* Core inflation falls to 4.5%, below estimates of 4.6%. Previous reading was 5.1%, where it was stuck for the last 3 months. 
* Headline inflation came 3.4%, below estimates fo 3.5% and down from 4% where it was for last 3 months. 
* Largest downward contributions came from food, restaurants and cafes.
* Biggest upward contributions came form housing and motor fuels. 
* This is an encouraging print, pointing to possible dovish BOE. Following the print, futures now point to 71 bps of BoE cuts by year end, vs 67bps before the print.  
* EIA Crude Stock Data 
* Of course, the main focus of today is the Fed decision, and Powell’s press conference. 
* Dot plot will be released with the report. Could show we have taken another cut out of there.

2024-03-20 07:28:30,LoneRoadReed,What did i miss on this trade? (TSLA),"Testing ORB strategy in 5 min TF with TSLA today and failed.

So i bought the second it broke the range upward (even tho i saw the down trend on 1h candles and determined that it was most likely gonna be a bearish open) and it quikly went down to my stop. Did i rush it and bought too soon? Or was the biggest mistake not listening to myself when i saw a down trend and buying anyways? Because even if i shorted when it broke downward i would have been stopped anyways right? Because the wick of the third candle when up quite a bit.

If i missed something that would have told me it was a bad idea to go with TSLA please tell me because i'm not sure if it's the strategy that failed or me (Guessing it was me).

2024-03-25 20:48:54,theelitehindu,Deriving a TSLA Trade Idea from Market Profile,"Hi r/Daytrading, I wanted to share my TSLA trade idea and bias development based off of the market profile from the last few weeks. 

Below is a screenshot of daily market profiles, merged based on how I view the auction. 

[TSLA Market Profile Chart post gap-down](https://preview.redd.it/s9svre2d1lqc1.png?width=2556&format=png&auto=webp&s=62f003b3b94f3b258717e1352ba1648126f7a52a)

After a gap down, we found balance in the 175-180 range. Sellers initiated price further down, until a responsive bid was found in the low 160s. Since then, we have continued to auction below 175, which is my bottom reference from the previous auction area from early March. There were two attempts to re-trade that distribution, both of which were swiftly traded down. With value being created lower over the past 2 weeks, I believe there is an opportunity to take advantage of a short on TSLA. 

  
Further confirmation on bearish bias can be seen on the daily profiles over the last 6 days. While we are auctioning within a range, the structure of the profiles in many days take a 'p'-shape. During a downtrend, this structure is synonymous with short covering, and re-entering at a higher price. 

[TSLA Daily Profile since 3-18](https://preview.redd.it/ud3vf6kc7lqc1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad85643f8f3b3bd86badc91a80772eb94e6d2bab)

With that being said, I want to look to size into a short around 174-176, with a stop at 178. I would look to risk off near the high volume node at 173, take profit at the bottom of the auction range and leave runners to the responsive bid accumulation range of \~163

Trade Idea Breakdown

Short: 174-176

Stop: Above 178

TP1: 173

TP2: 173

Is there any strategy called tesla 3,6,9 strategy which can forecast potential market movements?  A familiar guy told me about this & claims its very effective  but won't share details and passively tried to sell his course.  Is this thing real or he is just bluffing?  
I saw his trading performance its good.
Thank you for your time."
2024-03-30 10:13:06,Function_Initial,How to Get Body Used to Going Back to a Regular Job?,"So, I began trading in 2020 like most people. I have significant health issues which led to me having to stay unemployed during COVID for an extended period (I take chemotherapy to treat my disease). It was the only legal way for me to make extra income. I was adept from the beginning, however as we all know there were still plenty of lessons natural talent can’t teach you. Anyways, I went up around 15k at my highest off of $2000, and had no idea TSLA options were so volatile in comparison to the ones I was used to. I had some swings, but eventually ran out of day trades since I was using a margin account and ended up sustaining a huge loss. (I didn’t know cash accounts were t+1 for options — one of my first trading mistakes I learned lol)

That’s what motivated me to begin studying and trading full-time, because I hate losing if I enjoy something. By late 2022 I discovered cash settled indices and I immediately advanced into profitable territory. By the middle of 2023 I’d made back the money I’d lost, and currently I’m way ahead of where I started. 

I just made $7800 on Thursday trading. My position is going to be as an attorney — I’ll be making around 70k a year. Yes, I know I can trade foreign markets in my off-hours, but all my time and focus needs to go towards passing the bar exam as I receive two, $7500 raises — one for passing the bar and the other for a year of service. I want the guaranteed money over risk.

I’m posing this question because this extended weekend made me begin to realize I crave trading at this point (over the long term, meaning that I know I have to quit trading for the foreseeable future and this weekend made me realize it). It makes me feel some extremely large highs, and invariably lows when I make a mistake (this is what has allowed me to continue staying profitable — but at the cost of significant stress). I had trouble sleeping last night because I believe my body is releasing adrenaline during trading and acting as pseudo-exercise. I can normally fall asleep after a day of trading.

Has anyone been in a similar boat of returning to work or perhaps moved from a high-paying financial job to a different sector job? I’m proud of the position I got, it has been my goal for many years. I just REALLY like trading, and I don’t hate money. Maybe I’m just feeling this way because trading will be out of my life for about two years? Thank you!

*Also to any newer traders wondering if it’s worth it to cut losses or keep training and moving forward with trading? I wouldn’t suggest it. I learned valuable life skills and lessons, but the pure amount of time I’ve sunk in the last four years doesn’t seem worth it. Take this as you will.*"

**what does this measure?**

this report looks at the average size of green & red days broken down by weekday. I separated performance by green & red days to show you if a certain weekday moves differently based on if it's bullish or bearish.

**green days**

this section averages the performance for all the green days in your selected timeframe — giving you an idea of how certain weekdays move and what kind of opportunities they provide.

the day with the largest positive move is Monday, with an average move of $6.07.

**red days**

this section averages the performance for all the red days in your selected timeframe — giving you an idea of how certain weekdays move and what kind of opportunities they provide.

the day with the largest negative move is Thursday, with an average move of $-8.01.

**why green & red days by weekday matter:**

certain weekdays can have specific performance tendencies, seeing the data can help you pick a direction on the day, set profit targets, and stop losses.

if Monday's generally close green, this gives you context on which direction to lean toward. if the stock opens below the green/red price, you can look for an entry below targeting that green/red price."
2024-04-19 04:43:22,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is everything you need to know in premarket 19/04 after Israel retaliates against Iran.,"**OVERNIGHT GEOPOLITICS:**

* Israel launched 3 drones on Iran with a military base in the city of Isfahan the target. Nuclear site was near there. 
* No damage to nuclear site.
* Iran says they were able to destroy the 3 drones over Isfahan. 
* Israel apparently gave pre warning to the US that they would do this. 
* Senior Iranian official says no plans or immediate retaliation, Israel has already seen our reaction. That’s calming things down a bit. 
* Iran are signalling they will not retaliate. 
* IAEA criticises nuclear facility as ever being a target. 
* Shipping firms jump after Israel attack, on expected shipping supply problems which will boost freight rates

ANALYSIS: 

* Big reaction in after hours after Israel attacked in retaliation to Iran. In truth, there esponse was quite measured, and Iran is saying they aren’t planning a big retaliation. 
* Initially, we saw JPY and CHF get bid, along with Gold and oil. These are safe haven assets, thats why. Meanwhile, AUD, NZD, BTC and Equities all sold off as risk on assets. 
* The drop triggered CTA selling on futures, which led to a more exaggerated impact. Furthermore, we are in a scenario of Market illiquidity, buyback blackout, market depth very low. This makes the after hours response more exaggerated. 
* VIX jumped. 
* Now, we see the initial reaction almost entirely pared. Futures have recovered, but will be weighed by Netflix earnings. 
* Vix is selling off, and currency movement has normalised.
* Remember OPEX today on top which will drive volatility, particularly at open and at closing. 
* On oil, expect more choppiness as skew continues to point lower despite the geopolitics news overnight
* Skew on SPX is lower. Look, yes, SPX is selling off, but it still appears to be hedging. Institutions are buying dips, whilst hedging for downside with weekly vix calls. 
* Mag7 skew still points higher, and credit spreads are very low. 
* Institutions, from money flows, we can see, are not selling just because of the pullback. They are actually going more long.
* It’s just because of the lack of liquidity and VIX being elevated, market makers aren’t supporting the full recovery in SPX yet. 
* THis is still a bullish environment, just being rocked by persistent geopolitical news which is spiking vix, forcing market makers to remove liquidity. 
* Once geopolitical situation normalises, we will see vix lower and more likely a squeeze higher.
* Main risks to this thesis are earnings surprises by big firms, and also more geopolitical unrest. If Iran is right that they won’t retaliate big time to this attack, then probably we see the 2nd point not really materialise. 
* TSLA looks a bit dicey to me though. Semis can struggle a bit too if TSM continues lower as it doesnt yet look like traders are looking to jump in. Continued call selling. Maybe see drop to 125. 
* If we look at GOOGl, Skew points lower as we see so downward presusre persists into opex. 

DATA LEDE:

* Japanese Inflation ate, came in at 2.7%, in line with expectations. Slightly down from last months reading of 2.8%   
 Core came in at 2.6%, slightly down from last months 2.8%
* Overall, still maintaining BOJ’s target above 2%
* UK retail sales:
* YOY came in at 0.8% missing expectation of 1%. Better than -0.4% last month
* MOM was 0%, vs forecast of 0.3%
* Core retail sales came -0.3% MOM vs forecast of 0.3%
* Core retails ales YOY was 0.4% missing exp of 1%
* So slightly soft Retail sales , particularly on core retail sales. 
* Retail stocks in Europe then underperformed as Retail numbers came in soft. 

MARKETS:

* Futures slumped initially after Israel launched airstrikes on Iran in response to attack last week.
* This led SPX to be down 2% to 4930 initially, before initial impact was pared, and now SPX trades back at 5000. 
* NDX dropped more than 2% to the 17k level, before bouncing off and recovering back to 17399. 
* Dow Jones was down to below 37,300, before increasing again back to 37,665. 
* HKG50: Sold off to the 16k level, before recovering with the US markets. 
* Ger40: was lower overnight but push higher this morning means Ger40 nearly turns green. 
* Oil jumped initially back to 85, before paring the gains back to 82.5. SO now just marginally up. 
* Similar on Gold
* VIX - after the attack overnight, VIX jumped to 21 as markets sold off, but VIX has sold off the gain and is back at 19, which has fuelled the recovery in markets as market makers add liquidity back. 

FX:

* After Israel airstrikes on Iran in response to attack last week, we initially saw Yen and CHF jump as safe haven assets, whilst AUD and NZD dropped initially as they are risk on assets.

* This coincides with the paring of losses on indices.

2024-04-29 05:06:24,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket including analysis of USDJPY after intervention and TSLA positioning,"**ANALYSIS:**

* Let’s look at and analyse the main things happening in premarket first of all. 
* Firstly, the Yen intervention, which Japan’s Kanda hasn’t confirmed but reports are out from DJ that thats what happened this morning. 
* We saw yen weaken to 160 vs the USD. This was touted by JPM as the intervention point that BOJ were looking at, although their commentary last week was all very much vague. 
* When we saw 160 hit, we saw a big drop in USDJPY, as yen squeezed higher. 
* The price action was more extreme because Japan has a national holiday today, hence trading volumes were thin. 
* WE saw it drop from 160 to 154.5
* It found support from the technicals at the 20 day Moving average, as we see below:
* We saw recovery above the 155 level. 155 is one of the key gamma levels, where there is a lot of put support there. The bigger key gamma level, below this is 152. There is a hell of a lot of put support at 152. If the BOJ wants the yen to meaningfully improve vs the USD, it needs to get USDJPY below 152. Thats when we can go meaningfully lower. Above there, and we expect it to find support from these gamma levels and move higher, as we saw it do from 155. 
* Skew actually points higher in USDJPY now. This tells us that traders are not really expecting much more meaningful intervention right now. We can see USDJPY move higher again soon. Probably won’t be as effective as BOJ hoped. 
* Now the other key news from premarket, is TESLA, who have now received the regulatory approval for FULL self driving in China, rather than the limited product they had on offer already. 
* Tesla is pumping in premarket. 
* If we look at the gamma levels, we see 200 as having a lot of open interest. As such, we can see it as a magnet for price action moving forward. 
* FTSE pushed higher to 8200, but we see skew lowering. This tells us traders are hedging for price action to mveo lower now. The move is likely close to done for now, except if the Fed support move higher. We expect that because OTM delta isnt really showing much call delta so traders aren’t betting FTSE goes much higher. 
* HKG50 breakout from downtrend since 2023 continues, hitting 18k level today. 18k is v big gamma level, hence why we saw price action reverse from here. 
* In SPX, we see traders unwind some of their hedges as they bet that geopolitical pressures are mostly behind us. We see that too, as oil skew points lower which suggests traders expect oil to move down soon. 
* Finally, busy week ahead. 
* This week ahead, we have FOMC decision on Wednesday, as well as jobs numbers throughout the week, which will give us some insight into the labour market. 
* Put on top of that all the following earnings reports, and we are set for a volatile week of trading. 

DATA LEDE:

* Spain inflation rate:
* 3.3% YOY vs 3.4% expected, previous reading was 3.2%
* SO ticked up from last month, but not as much as expected. 
* GERMAN inflation rate:

MARKETS:

* SPX set to open above 5100 this morning, pulled up by Tesla and Aapl. Currently trading at 5112. This is just above the highs of Friday. 
* Nasdaq: up 0.3% in premarket, trading at 17,780. 17,850 is a resistance, then The next big resistance will be the 18k level. 
* Dow Jones: Flat in premarket, trading at 38,300. 
* HKG50 up 1% again in premarket. Now at 17,750. Touched 18k then came down from there. 18k is now the strong resistance. 
* UK100 higher to 8200, pared slightly to 8180. Still up 0.4% today. 
* GER40: flat around 18,140.
* Oil: Flat at 83.65. Maintaining the uptrend drawn since December 2023. 
* GOld: Flat above 2300. 
* VIX: Vix flat at 15.22. last week closed perfectly at the put support of 15. Was a big VIX crush last week. Opened today at 15.22. 

FX:

* USDJPY closed Friday at 158.3.
* In early Monday trading, it moved up to 160. This was a key level where traders were hedging for intervention.
* It seemed as though we did get that fX intervention hence the big decline.
* This decline was right down to 154.5
* This is where the 20 day Moving average was and so it found support there.
* Also a key gamma level at 155. 
* It moved below this level, before recovering above again. 
* Note: its a national holiday in Japan, hence why more exaggerated trading on thin volumes. 
* Despite this no official comment from BOJ that they have intervened, although that is the clear assumption. 
* So Yen squeezed higher after hitting 160 vs USD
* All other currencies quite flat compared.
* GBPUSD up 0.3% to 1.253EURUSD same trend, up 0.2% after selling off on Friday. Now at 1.071. On Friday, it retested 1.07 before pushing higher.

2024-04-29 13:03:11,SkyWorldDev,Today I learned why you should not risk more than 2-3% of your capital per trade,"I usually risked 5 to 7% of my capital per trade, with a risk-reward ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 (Two or three times the amount you risk per trade). Last week, I suffered one of the worst losing streaks since the start of the year, and my account ended at -60%. 

I had a period of reflection and research, which helped me a lot, since I quickly recovered a lot of the capital that I had lost thanks to that, having adjusted my mindset and strategy. I changed my risk-reward ratio to 1:1.5, and started trading consistently, rather than trying to chase big profit trades.

From the lowest point of my account, I am currently at more than 113.5% profit, and I still need to earn almost 20% more to recover 100% of the loss and for my account to end the month in breakeven (My account reached +23% this month at some point)"
2024-05-16 09:19:58,ZhangtheGreat,What was the first time the market slapped you hard?,"Unless you’re just getting started, you know the feeling. Maybe you saw it coming, or maybe you didn’t, but for all of us who’ve been in the market for a while, that first time we were kicked in the chin and had to take it certainly didn’t feel good.

I’ll admit that, for me, it was during the meme stock hype. I finally gave into my urge to jump into AMC, but then to see it keep dropping and the red number get bigger with each passing moment was making me sweat puddles. Ultimately, the pain was too much, and I cut my triple-digit loss (might sound small, but I was trading _very_ conservatively and had only won one trade over $50 until that point). To make it even more frustrating, that was the _only_ day AMC tanked before continuing its run to the moon.

Looking back, that slap was a blessing in disguise, as it finally forced me to start learning how to read charts and trade the proper way.

What was yours?"
2024-05-22 05:03:19,TearRepresentative56,"I'm a full time trader and this is my total pre market cheat sheet, including positioning analysis on US markets, NVDA, TSLA and FX. ","ANALYSIS:

Overall US Market:

* SPX Skew is elevated, traders remain bullish. Skew points slightly down, but this is hedging ahead of FOMC. Traders selling some calls but its v low volume. 
* Note: positioning and trader sentiment around NVDA remains bullish. 
* Because of this positive expectation around NVDA, traders are buying calls on QQQ. Traders expect Nasdaq rot continue to go higher. 
* So we do see some disparity there in what traders are doing. They are more bullish on tech right now ahead of NVDA. 
* Momentum continues to show stronger buyers, we are at ATH on both QQQ and SPX. 
* MSFT and NFLX both hit new highs yesterday. 
* VIX liquidity continues to be very low, whilst liquidity in equities is increasing. The fact that VIX liquidity is very low is a sign that traders have no real fear in the market. Bulls v comfortable right now.

On FX & metals:

* As mentioned in other post, GBPUSD positioning bullish, particularly after CPI came hotter than expected. Short term and long term we see skew point up. 1.28 target. on EURUSD, skew points higher but price is stuck below 1.085 for now. 1.08 is clear support, traders target 1.09, even calls on 1.10.
* On Gold and Silver, we can see a slight pullback or flattening whilst traders wait to see more volume. V low volume but mostly traders selling their calls now and buying puts. Still low volumes though so not expecting big moves. But also not seeing big move higher yet.

Key stocks for focus:

* **NVDA: skew is flattish this week but pointing higher. Traders will be looking for 1000 if earnings come in in line. More if stock split. A lot of calls around there. As a result of NVDA earnings looking higher, SMCI higher too. Other semis in general quite bullish on hopeful expectations for NVDA.**
* **TSLA: Got bit of a jump yday as skew pointed higher and we got good news to support. Gamma is mostly between 180-190. Can see move to 190 if NVDA supports, but beyond that not much OTM call gamma. Positioning iTM is strong but not seeing move higher. More likely possible rejection from 100D MA.**



DATA LEDE:

* UK CPI: Headline came out 2.3% vs 2.1% expected. Still down a lot on the 3.2% last month. Hot, but not that bad. 
* But if we look under the hood, we see that there are areas of the UK inflation that are heating up. 
* Core CPI came 3.9% vs 3.6% expected. Only down slightly from 4.2%
* And if we look at Services in particular, we see Services inflation at 5.9%, much hotter than the 5.4% expected and more or less sticky to last month.

* NVDA positioning update:
* So for this OPEX, we see bullish positioning ITM but slighly more puts opening up. It is slight, but it's there. Lower volumes too. But if we look for a later opEX like August, we can see very bullish positioning OTM. Traders are expecting NVDA to continue rising into August
* Traders look like they are even targeting as high as 150 by then.
* [https://imgur.com/a/vcJXBZ0](https://imgur.com/a/vcJXBZ0) 
* Across the MAg7 and semis we see strong positioning:
* Googl positioning is mostly flat
* But AVGO, MU NVDA, SMCI etc all very strong positioning
* AMZN positioning flat but improving as traders looking higher. 
* IWM looks choppy for today but let’s see. 
* look at USO, which is an oil ETF and will give us a better read on Oil/ bullish and supportive positioning ITM. Not much OTM Put delta but a fair bit of ITM Call delta will support. A lot of call delta on 80, which makes it a target.Not seeing signs of big pullback here rn.
* GOld - skew is pointing higher, this tells us that traders are looking higher and senitment is improving, while gold holds 2300. 2350 looks like the resistance atm. Top options are buying calls, selling puts. 2400C a target. Looks like improving momentum under hood, but lets see after retail sales.
* [https://imgur.com/a/ZqM1QJ6](https://imgur.com/a/ZqM1QJ6) Here we see top options mostly calls buying and puts selling
* FTSE update: still stuck in this downtrend. needs to break 8200 to go higher, below this and we can see pullback, but positioning is improving ITM with more call delta showing up which means that the price action will be more supportive now.

2024-06-28 11:59:15,GetEdgeful,TSLA only breaks the IB high 23% of the time when THIS HAPPENS,"https://preview.redd.it/w7993rq30d9d1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=af8ea255a4a762505df45591f7d6d4a26c935437

what does this measure?

this report looks at the initial balance (IB), which is the high and low formed during the first hour of trading. it checks the order in which the IB is formed and tracks which side breaks first: the high or the low. this helps identify the direction of the initial breakout after the IB is established.

**example** if the IB high is formed first, then the low forms, and it's more likely for the low to break after the IB is formed, then you can take positions targeting a break of the IB low.

how can I use this?

understanding the initial balance rejection can help you anticipate market direction after the first hour of trading. if the low is made first and the high breaks out more often, you can plan for a bullish move. conversely, if the high is made first and the low breaks out more often, you can prepare for a bearish move.

based on which side of the IB forms first, you want to target the side of the IB that breaks most often.

how can I use this?

you can use this report to set their trading strategies based on the initial balance rejection patterns. by knowing the likelihood of the initial breakout direction, you can better position your trades, set stop losses, and take profits effectively."

2024-07-13 11:11:10,Round-Progress5713,How are people able to make money trading large cap stocks or forex.,"I've been trying to learn the concepts of trading through paper accounts for the past couple months. I originally was trading futures but I decided that I really didn't know what I was doing, I was basically gambling. This past month I've started trading options for larger stocks, I've been reading the chart of TSLA for example, predicting it'll go up or down and buying a call or put accordingly. What i'm struggling to understand is how you see people making huge daily gains by scalping these large stocks like TSLA AAPL etc. Just looking at the charts, the stocks barely move much. For example, on the AAPL chart; this move looks huge but in reality it's just a $1 move. (1minute timeframe)

https://preview.redd.it/qbih8dhitbcd1.png?width=2164&format=png&auto=webp&s=4462999a773e9c3b964c4784c1dfd9ef578cfefe

How are people making money scalping these stocks. If you put $100,000 and wrote 430ish shares of apple you are only making $430 in profit. How can you actually profit off this?? My same question applies to futures, I see like $0.002 moves being traded but let's say you put in $100,00 and made $0.002 off each dollar you're still only making 200 dollars. Do these traders just have insanely huge accounts or am I missing something."
2024-07-14 19:30:14,Soft_Video_9128,Does anyone understand how 2x (or 3x) ETFs make money?,"It's Sunday night, futures market opened, the underlying TSLA gaps up almost 10% before cooling off. Meanwhile my sell limit at $15.60 triggers for TSLL (2x TSLA) and sells for $16. I had build up a $32k position over a couple days of averaging down from the big sell off Thursday. My net profit is a little over $3k. So my thought is, if I took $3k in profit, who the heck lost $3k? TSLL is a leveraged ETF, not the underlying TSLA where winners and losers are a bit blurred. Also over a couple of months, I've probably taken profit on TSLL maybe $6k in total. This is one of a basket of stocks I trade in and out of all the time.

* Wall Street played a game of tug-of-war on Monday, as stocks wavered but managed to cling to the momentum from last week’s rally.

Meanwhile, the Dow dropped 140 points, or 0.36%, as investors grew jittery ahead of crucial inflation data set to drop this week.
* With the Consumer Price Index report on Wednesday and retail sales data following on Thursday, all eyes are on the economic gauges that could either steady or spook the markets. After a week of whiplash, traders are hoping for clarity, but the volatility might not be over just yet.

But wait, there’s more. The tri-motor Cyberbeast, the souped-up version that puts your foot to the floor with more torque and speed, now costs $119,990. That’s a $20K hike from just a week ago. Remember when Elon Musk promised a $39,990 Cybertruck back in 2019? Ah, simpler times. With the base model gone, it looks like Tesla is banking on buyers with deeper pockets and a taste for luxury—because clearly, the entry-level market isn’t a priority anymore.

# Fast Deliveries or Slowing Demand?

Tesla claims it’s speeding up delivery times, with AWD models potentially arriving as early as this month. But don’t let the expedited shipping fool you—these price hikes might just be a sign that demand is cooling off faster than Musk anticipated. After all, how many folks are really ready to shell out six figures for a truck that looks like it drove straight out of a sci-fi flick?

Meanwhile, Cybertruck's bumpy road continues with recalls, sinking profits in Tesla's latest quarter, and a flurry of federal investigations. The dream of an affordable, mass-market EV truck seems further away than ever. Plus, faster deliveries could signal that Tesla's inventory is growing—a red flag that maybe, just maybe, those million pre-orders aren’t translating into actual sales. So, while Tesla might be speeding up production, it could also be facing the reality that a $100K truck isn’t exactly a hot commodity. But hey, if you’ve got $100K burning a hole in your pocket, Tesla’s got just the truck for you.

# Trump Returns to X, $DJT Stock Takes a Hit

Donald Trump is back on X (formerly Twitter), and his reappearance is already shaking things up. Just ahead of a highly anticipated interview with Elon Musk, shares of Trump Media & Technology Group ($DJT) dipped 5%. The interview, scheduled for 8 p.m. ET, marks Trump’s first major return to the platform since August 2023. The question on everyone’s mind: What does this mean for Trump’s own social media platform, Truth Social?

# X Marks the Spot

Trump’s return to X is a big deal—after all, this is the platform that played a huge role in his political rise. But there’s a twist. Trump previously vowed to stick to his own platform, Truth Social, after being banned from major social media sites. His comeback to X might signal a shift in strategy, especially with the 2024 election looming. And let’s not forget, this move comes after Musk’s recent endorsement of Trump, despite their very public beef just a couple of years ago.

# Stocks Stumble as the Spotlight Shifts

Trump’s return to X isn’t just about tweets—it’s affecting his wallet, too. Shares of Trump Media took a hit, dropping 5% on Monday. Investors seem to be questioning whether Trump’s renewed presence on X could spell trouble for Truth Social. After all, why would Trump’s followers stick around on his platform if he’s back to tweeting up a storm on X?

The timing couldn’t be more critical. Trump Media has been struggling financially, reporting a net loss of $16.4 million in the second quarter. With stocks already down nearly 50% since its public debut, the pressure is on. 



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Investors are bracing for a pivotal week of inflation data, with the Producer Price Index (PPI) report dropping on Tuesday, followed by the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday. Economists are forecasting a slight slowdown in July’s PPI, expecting a 0.1% monthly increase compared to June’s 0.2%. This could be an early indicator that inflation pressures on producers are easing, which might bring some optimism to the markets ahead of the CPI release.

As it stands, there’s a nearly even split among investors on whether the Federal Reserve will opt for a 50-basis-point rate cut in September, with current odds at 48%, down from 52% just a short time ago. All eyes are on these reports as they could heavily influence the Fed's next steps and the market's direction.

# Before Market Open:

* **Home Depot** ($HD) is one to watch as it gears up to report earnings. The home improvement giant saw a major boost during the pandemic, with folks stuck at home taking on DIY projects. But with the stock flatlining this year, investors are nervous that the renovation boom may be fading. This earnings report could set the tone for Home Depot’s performance for the rest of 2024. Analysts are expecting $4.50 earnings per share (EPS) on $43.38 billion in revenue.
* Meanwhile, **Tencent Music Entertainment** ($TME), a subsidiary of Chinese tech titan Tencent Holdings, is also in the spotlight. As a powerhouse in China’s music industry, TME has been eyeing global expansion, bolstered by its 8.6% stake in Spotify and a recent partnership with Universal Music Group. Investors will be eager to hear more about the company’s growth strategy. The consensus forecast is $0.16 EPS on $996.68 million in revenue."
2024-08-14 13:32:27,Miserable-Cucumber70,So which app is best for day trading?,"I've been on TOS for years and I love the interface however I'm at my wits end with the reliability.  Obviously when there is a major market move the app just crashes.  I'm also dealing with a message ""account not found"" that only comes up as I hit the send button.  Then I have to close the app, open it and log in again.  I missed 3 amazing trades today.  One was an early short on tsla 300 shares.  One a dell long at support 500 shares.  And another winner.   They cost me at least 1500 today. 

So I'm looking for alternatives.  I can't keep losing money and they can't resolve it.  To make it worse the tech guy admitted to me today that the app will always crash on enormous trading days like the recent crash.   
It sucks because I like it and don't want to learn a new app.  

So I'm curious what you guys have found is the best for trading.  I do large volume, shares only,  long and short.  Looking for low fees, quick reliable fills and an app that works all the time.  Appreciate any feedback you can give.  "
2024-08-15 11:33:13,CryptographerOk4571,Trading is so damn frustrating! ,"I am so trying to get more out of my winners, but my emotions always get the best of me, and i sell or partial too early.

Just today i was in NVDA and TSLA. I had taken some profits initially and added on to both of them as they were going in my direction. They started chopping around when the market started going down and i ended up selling both of them without waiting for them to come to my breakeven. My thesis was that atleast let me walk away with some profit, than give away all the unrealized profit by waiting them to come to my breakeven. Turned out both of them rallied hard after i sold, and i ended up with literally half the profit then i could have on the day.

If they would have come to my breakeven then my profit would have been even lower for the day, so maybe i should be just happy that i made more by not waiting for the price to come to breakeven, but if i had actually hold i could have made 100% more on what i ended the day on.

My trade execution needs a lot of practice.

So damn frustrating. Sorry. just ranting to get over it."

The recommended trading strategy includes exiting 25% at T1 (245) with the stop loss moved to breakeven, exiting 50% at T2 (255) with the stop loss moved to T1, and exiting the remaining 25% at T3 (260). The stop loss is initially set at 220 to limit potential downside. It is important to monitor the volume closely for confirmation of a breakout above 235+, as increased volume could signify a stronger breakout move.

I made $800 this week, so should I look at it like this?

$800/$150,000 = +0.53% weekly return

or

$800/$60,000 = +1.33% Weekly return

I have $60,000 of my own money, but using $150,000 to trade which uses my money as collateral. I could be on the hook for the remainder if in under extreme circumstances I were to lose it and didn't get liquidated in time, so I am seeing myself risk $150,000 not $60,000.

* Israeli PM says Iran made a big mistake tonight and will pay for it. 
* Iranian president describes Israel’s Iron dome as more vulnerable than glass. 
* Market basically awaiting Israeli response. Likely to be targeted at Iran’s Oil infrastructure. This will be the key. 
* I believe from reading rhetoric of Iran’s chiefs, that their attack is all they really want to do. So if Israel’s response is measured, it should be the end soon. 

MACRO news: 

* Euro unemployment rate was 6.4% in line with expectations. 
* ADP numbers came stronger than expected. 143k vs 120k expected. That’s strong. Points to strong NFP on Friday most likely.

* To address this, Lamb Weston is closing its Connell, WA facility, temporarily curtailing some production lines, and reducing its global workforce by about 4%. The company also cut FY25 capex to $750M (from $850M) and expects $55M in pre-tax savings from these actions.

# The DOJ Wants To Break Up Google’s Monopoly

Google's monopoly reign might be facing its toughest challenge yet. The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) is weighing a move that could break up the tech titan after a judge ruled it unlawfully dominated search and ad markets. 

In a court filing, the DOJ proposed everything from breaking off pieces of Google’s business (think Chrome and Android) to forcing the company to share its search data with competitors. It’s a bold step that echoes the antitrust battles of the early 2000s…remember Microsoft?

Not surprisingly, Google isn’t too thrilled. The company called the DOJ’s plan ""radical"" and warned that messing with its business model could have unintended consequences, like fewer free services for users. Meanwhile, Alphabet shares slid 1.6% on the news—cue the market jitters.

**Tech Titans Under the Microscope**  
Google’s not the only one sweating right now. Almost half of the S&P 500, including big names like Meta, Nvidia, and Amazon, are in antitrust hot water too. Regulators are accusing them of crushing competition and monopolizing key markets. 

But, despite these lawsuits, Big Tech’s still living its best life, with stock prices climbing thanks to AI innovation.

The DOJ’s real focus? The future of search, especially with AI on the rise. They want to prevent Google from flexing its dominance as AI-powered search tools become the norm. Regulators are thinking long-term here, trying to stop Google from maintaining its stranglehold in the tech space.

**The Long Legal Road Ahead**  
Judge Amit Mehta, who ruled Google was guilty of monopolistic behavior, now has to decide what to do about it. The DOJ’s suggested remedies range from “just change your behavior” to “time to break up the band.” 

While some experts think a breakup is unlikely (at least anytime soon), this legal battle is far from over. Google’s going to fight, and they’re likely to appeal any decisions not in their favor.

**The Big Picture:** Despite the legal storm, analysts aren’t losing sleep over it. Tech stocks have been riding high, with investors more interested in earnings and product launches than courtroom drama. For now, it’s business as usual, but if the DOJ really manages to pull off a Google breakup? Well, that could be a game-changer.

# WeightWatchers To Offer Compounded GLP-1 Weight-Loss Drugs

WeightWatchers just jumped into the weight-loss drug game with a twist. The company announced it’ll start offering a compounded version of Wegovy (aka a cheaper knockoff) after facing shortages of the real deal. 

At $129 for the first month and $189 thereafter, it’s a far cry from the $1,300 price tag of branded options like Ozempic. Naturally, the stock shot up by nearly 47% on the news.

But the real question is—how long can this ride last?

**It’s Getting Crowded in Here**  
WeightWatchers is showing up a bit late to the knockoff Wegovy party, where companies like Hims & Hers and Noom have been hanging out for months. But what WeightWatchers brings to the table is its bread-and-butter combo of behavioral coaching and clinical support. 

So, it’s not just about the drugs—it’s about changing the whole lifestyle.

Still, the FDA is cracking down. They’ve already removed drugs like Mounjaro from the shortage list, which means compounded versions could disappear fast. For now, semaglutide (the magic behind Wegovy and Ozempic) remains in short supply, so WeightWatchers might still have time to carve out its slice of the market.

**WeightWatchers' Identity Crisis**  
This move comes at a shaky time for WeightWatchers. They’ve had a rough year, with their stock losing more than 90% of its value. Plus, CEO Sima Sistani exited stage left just two weeks ago, and Oprah—yes, *the* Oprah—ditched the board earlier this year after admitting she’s been on weight-loss meds herself. Yikes.

But interim CEO Tara Comonte is trying to steer the ship by banking on this drug offering, even as the weight-loss world shifts away from the traditional ""dieting"" approach that WeightWatchers has been known for.

**Can They Keep the Momentum?:** The stock surge suggests investors like what they’re seeing for now, but the weight-loss landscape is getting tougher by the day. With FDA regulations tightening and plenty of competitors already in the game, it’ll be interesting to see how long WeightWatchers can keep riding this wave.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The weekly initial jobless claims report is here again, and all eyes are on it, especially with the Fed’s focus on the labor market as it charts the course for future rate cuts.

However, tomorrow’s CPI report is set to steal the spotlight. CPI tracks the monthly price shifts in goods that Americans buy, making it a crucial measure of inflation. Economists predict a 2.3% annual increase in September’s CPI, up from August’s 2.1%, while core CPI, which excludes the more volatile food and energy prices, is expected to hold steady at 3.2%. If these numbers hold, the Fed may feel more confident about proceeding with rate cuts. But any surprises could throw a wrench in those plans, keeping investors on edge.

# Before Market Open:

* **Delta Air Lines** ($DAL) has been cruising with a 25% gain in 2024, but the real turbulence could hit with this week’s earnings. It’s the first report since their July tech fiasco that grounded flights and canceled over 7,000 trips worldwide. Management has prepped everyone for a hit to the bottom line, but now the question is, how hard will it land? Analysts expect $1.55 EPS on $14.74 billion in revenue.
* **Domino’s Pizza** ($DPZ), the global pizza king, has been slinging pies like a pro, thanks to its massive scale. But last quarter, things got a little sticky with slowing international growth and a sudden decision to stop sharing new store counts. Investors will be hungry for some answers. Consensus: $3.62 EPS, $1.1 billion in revenue."

DXCM - Cautious outlook, challenges and growth concerns. US sales decline, leaves FY forecasts unchanged. 

* Stock was initially down 16%, now down 7%
* Price targets mostly cut, but bullish rating as big banks see the company as undervalued. Bernstein and JPM actually RAISED Price target. 
* In my opinion, is a hard one to play though as Hardware revenue guidance missed the market by a LOT. 

MAG 7:

* AAPl - importantly, Keybanc has downgraded AAPL to underweight, price target at 200. 
* This downgrade was driven by Consumer Survey that says that many users are looking t the iPhone SE as a viable alternative to the iPhone 16. As such, iPhone SE can cannibalise demand for iPhone 16. Also they said broad based growth expectations appear unrealistic, and with this, the valuation is expensive.

* MSFT - Bernstein rates outperform, PT 500. Said that story is well understood. Street will be looking at Azur growth, AI tailwind, sustainability of office 365 and margins. Said more products and services. They are bullish on these elements. 
* TSLA - MSUK SAYS REPORT FROM WSJ ABOUT REGULAT CONTACT WITH PUTIN IS NOT TRUE AT AL.

2024-10-27 09:22:26,FixedIt00,"I missed out on $40,000 gains in one day last week and it was the right thing to do. As time passes, I find that I am not mad at myself. I consider this a big sign of growth in my journey.","I went long TSLA 900 shares after the Robotaxi Event dump, expecting it would creep up before Earnings but it kept sliding down. I worked hard to predict the direction it would go after Earnings but was not confident and I did not want to risk a big drop so I got out Wednesday at 3:58pm, 7 minutes before it shot up 30 points and kept going Thursday and Friday. 

I have no regrets. I have struggled to fight the gambling impulse and I have had good results the past year. I am at peace with missing the big gain on TSLA because I know in the long run I will avoid big losses even more. Good luck with your journey."
2024-10-28 00:07:13,Interesting-Owl7000,Brokerage research reports on Tesla (TSLA)?,"Hey there,



I'm on the hunt for some brokerage research reports on Tesla (TSLA) to get a better grasp of the company's financials and industry trends. I'm looking for the actual PDFs that the brokers publish, but I'm kinda new to this and not sure where the best places are to find these reports.



I'm especially keen on getting detailed analysis, financial projections, and any insights into the EV market that these reports might have.



Any recommendations on where to find these research reports would be awesome! I'd love to hear your favorite spots for digging up this kind of info.



Thanks in advance for any tips you can share!"
2024-10-28 04:50:04,TearRepresentative56,28/10 - PREMARKET REPORT - All the major market moving news  from hours of premarket reading all condensed into one 5 minute read. ,"**MACRO DATA:**

* China industrial profits numbers come in at -3.5% vs 0.3% expected. Hence weak China industrial profit numbers. 
* Treasury auctions today for 6 month, 3 month, 2 year and 5 year. 
* With bonds a key focus at the moment in the market, being elevated, these treasury auctions are going to be that much more important. 

**MARKETS AND FX:**

* Japan’s Ruling LDP loses majority - uncertainty in parliament and markets. 
* Fell short of the 233 seat majority, only secured 215 seats. This means SHigeru Ishiba has to find new allies within 30 days to keep power. **The Bank of Japan’s rate path may face added complications with a weaker government. So less rate hikes.**
* Yen down today on this, nikkei higher on this. 
* Oil down as ISrael attack on Iran didnt target any oil facilities but instead focused on military bases. This reduces supply disruption which removes a tailwind for oil. Iran also downplayed the attack saying they do not want war. Traders had been bullish on oil on fri, v strong flow, but now IV crush lower. Traders caught out. nearing next support zone at 65.5-67
* SPX: Slightly higher, trading above the 5835 key level. 
* Nasdaq: Bounced off of 20,500 level in premarket. Most major big tech names higher. 
* Dow Jones: After sell off over last week, is just trying to recover the breakout at 42,300. 
* HKG50 - flat, despite China’s announcement of more stimulus. This shows that the stimulus announced did little to wet the appetite of investors. 
* GER40: gapped up but pared all the gains now flat on the day. 
* VIX: maintaining at 19.24.
* bond yields elevated. I will be hoping to see bond yields cool off as a result of plunging oil prices. Higher bond yields are a headwind to teh amrket as they attract invstor capital away from equities. We want to see bond yields fall asap, which should happen if we look at historical data on rising bond yields following the first rate cut.

**MAG 7:**

* TSLA - Bernstein gives another underperform rating, price target at 120. I think Bernstein can basically be ignored at this point. They are Tesla perma bulls and it’s just getting boring at this point. Said that margin strength in last quarter was driven by one off deferred revenue recognitions and commodity contract renewals. Said 20-30% unit growth as Tesla suggested is unlikely.
* TSLA - Price target raised to 298 from 278 at Canaccord, who maintain their buy rating. 
* TSLA - price target raised to 285 from 225 at Daiwa. Maintained at Buy. 
* These are more respectable price targets although I think Canaccord are closer to the mark. 
* TSLA.- extends its 5 year 0% interest loan offer in China until November 30th - increasing incentives on China demand. Applies to rear wheel drive and long range versions. 
* MST ahead of earnings, Truist mark as a buy, says they are set to outperform across key enterprise categories. Price target 600. 
* AAPL - JPM say that in their tracker of Apple product availability (as a proxy of demand), they see that lead times are more or less in line with iPhone 15, hence demand resilient. 

OTHER COMPANIES:

* Crypto names all higher in premarket again on strong bitcoin price action.
* Oil stocks all lower obviously on oil dumping.  
* CORZ - Jefferies initiated with buy rating, price target of 19. Said journey is impressive post bankruptcy comeback story. Said they are now utilising their power for Ai focused data centres. 
* HOOD - launching contracts that allow users to bet on the 2024 presidential election, following federal court ruling that cleared the way for election betting in the US. 
* INTC - expanding their facility in Chengdu, China in order to boost server chip packaging. 
* GPN - Bernstein says that they are rated at market perform, and represent a potential activist investor play. 
* LLY - received approval to sell Mounjaro in Hong Kong with sales expected to start by year end. This is their weight management and diabetes drug. They got ahead of NVO who haven’t launched their weight loss drug in Hong Kong yet. 
* Volkswagen is planning to cut costs, considering a 10% wage bill reduction and 2 year wage freeze. Also potential to cap bonuses for top employees
* TSM has suspended shipments to chinese chipmaker Sophgo after the TSM chips were found on Huawei’s Ascend. They say that Sophgo illegally redistributed TSM chips.
* Bigger news, TSM founder says the firm can still see most severe challenges from US restrictions. 
* MCD - ahead of earnings tomorrow, they announce they are bringing back quarter pounders next week after e coli outbreak is contained. Said that the contaminated products are no longer in their supply chain.

* AVTR higher after earnings related sell off on Friday. Currently higher as they got bullish price targets from Morgan Stnaley, Baird, RBC and Wells Fargo
* AAL - higher as Citigroup raises price target to 16 from 13.5.

OTHER NEWS:

* Japan’s Ruling LDP loses majority - uncertainty in parliament and markets. 
* Fell short of the 233 seat majority, only secured 215 seats. This means SHigeru Ishiba has to find new allies within 30 days to keep power. **The Bank of Japan’s rate path may face added complications with a weaker government. So less rate hikes.**
* Yen down today on this, nikkei higher on this. 
* BOJ will be on this week, expectation is for holding. 
* UK BUDGET WILL BE ANNOUNCED THIS WEEK. EXPECTATION IS FOR HIGHER BORROWING, TAX HIKES AND HIGHER SPENDING. Likely will see net growth positive budget, so more likely for cautious BoE cuts. 
* Big tech earnings this week - generally, major desks are optimistic going into the week.  JPM says the fact that any earnings question marks are being overlooked entirely with NFLX, NOW and VRT, bodes well for Mega cap earnings this week. 
* Apple in my opinion the one most likely to disappoint. 
* China announces a new outright open market reverse repo tool, targeting primary dealers. 
* Note that in truth this is useless. China here want to look like they are doing QE without actually doing QE it seems. I can’t imagine this measure will have any notable impact on the Chinese economy, which explains why the Hong Kong market is trading entirely flat. 
* Musk says that he can cut at least $2T from the federal budget if Tru-mp is elected as president. Trum-p has said that Musk will be head of cost cutting. 
* MOODYS cuts France’s rating outlook to negative over deficit woes. France are moving like Italy now. 
* NYSE to extend ARCA trading hours to 22 hours a day. Still pending regulatory approval.

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader.  
This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts.

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you—doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update.

2024-10-30 16:33:14,Brave-Hedgehog-1834,Risk % to include PDT minimum?,"For US based traders, with the 25k PDT restriction:

TL;DR:
I have a 1% daily max loss of account, divided by 10, for a 0.1% risked per trade, just so i get enough screen time before maxing out for the day.
Do you set your max daily risk % according to your overall account balance, or just the capital you have above the 25k PDT requirement? 


Ok, on to the more long winded post:
I'm in my 2nd horrible month (almost 2months with mostly red days) daytrading stocks on demo with the DAS platform. I MAY feasibly be able to actually have 30K usd to trade with in a year or 2. Potentially more, but i want to start real slow. So i set my demo account to 30k. My actual broker (which ive never actually used) is an IBKR margin account with $1 fee per order.

When calculating position size/stop loss for a 1% max daily loss of my account, that's $50. When i hit $50 loss, i quit for the day. 

Why $50? Because i figure i should trade on my capital OVER the 25k PDT rule so if I blow it, im not in the hole 25k and have to make that all back just to daytrade again.

Following SMBC's Mike Bellafiore's rules, i also should  allow for 10 consecutive losses before i hit that max daily loss of $50. Just to ensure i can still get enough screen time. So that's a $5 loss per trade. I tried that for a day, and the commissions were overwhelming with such small profits. So i usually do $10 risk per trade. But I still suck and am hitting my max daily loss a lot of days after only 5 trades. 

Im also tryna trade megacaps like TSLA and NVDA lately becasue i was getting absolutely demolished on slippage tryna play momo stonks a la Ross Cameron style. So obviously these expensive stocks are hard to play with such small risk capital.

So do you set your risk % according to your overall account balance, or just the capital you have above the 25k PDT requirement?

So far ive lost $1000 of that 5k this morning, and im wondering if my risk is too small, for the commisions i pay."
2024-10-31 17:05:13,Virtual_Information3,Stock Market Today: Super Micro's Auditor Resigns + Russia Fines Google More Than The World's Entire GDP,"* What goes up must come down. After hitting a fresh all-time high earlier this week on Big Tech earnings optimism, the Nasdaq took a nosedive, logging its worst day in almost two months. Microsoft and Meta led the tumble, each posting earnings that raised red flags over ballooning AI expenses. The Nasdaq slid 2.7%, the S&P 500 dropped 1.9%, and even the Dow wasn’t spared, losing 0.9%—a rough end to the month for all three major indexes.
* Wall Street was banking on a strong showing from Big Tech, but Thursday’s earnings reports delivered a reality check. Mixed results from other tech heavyweights left investors grappling for direction, with market jitters clearly lingering into after-hours trading.

# Super Micro Computer’s Auditor Ernst & Young resigns 

Super Micro’s rollercoaster ride hit a nosedive as Ernst & Young (EY) resigned as its auditor, citing “integrity concerns” that raised red flags on the company’s accounting practices.

EY’s exit sent the stock tumbling 33%, its worst drop in six years, and now leaves Super Micro scrambling for a new auditor just as the DOJ investigates allegations of revenue inflation from a former employee. For a company that surged with AI-driven demand earlier this year, the timing of these setbacks couldn’t be worse.

**Trust Issues and Rival Gains**  
  
This isn’t the first time Super Micro has come under fire for its numbers. Earlier this year, Hindenburg Research spotlighted the company for “glaring accounting red flags,” leading Super Micro to delay its annual financial report while it reassessed internal controls. 

Meanwhile, rivals like Dell may seize this moment to gain ground in the lucrative AI server market, where Super Micro has been a major player. As the stock continues to slump, the company’s competitors are watching closely.

**Delisting Risks Add Pressure**  
  
Super Micro’s troubles don’t end with its audit chaos. The company faces a November 16 deadline to regain compliance with Nasdaq rules or risk being delisted, a position it previously found itself in back in 2018. 

With time running out to find a new auditor, analysts are sounding alarms about the company’s future on the exchange. EY’s exit is a stark reminder of the fragility of market trust, and Super Micro now finds itself on thin ice with both Nasdaq and investors.

**Facing the Climb Back**  
  
Amid the upheaval, Super Micro is sticking to its core business promises, assuring stakeholders that its customer commitments and product roadmap remain on track. Yet, with its stock down over 75% from March highs and sentiment shaky, Super Micro’s future looks precarious. 

For a company that soared on the AI hype, rebuilding credibility with investors will require more than just words—it’ll need clear, clean financials and an auditor willing to sign on the dotted line.

# Russia Fines Google More Than The World's Entire GDP

Russia just dropped a $20 *decillion* fine on Google—yes, that’s 20 followed by 33 zeros. 

This “symbolic gesture,” as the Kremlin puts it, demands that Google unblock Russian state-supported media on YouTube, which the tech giant restricted following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While the sum is way beyond Google’s own market value, Moscow’s message is loud and clear: follow our rules, or face the fines.

**From Courts to Chaos**  
  
Google initially expected any disputes over blocked Russian channels to play out in U.S. or U.K. courts. Instead, Russian media companies have taken the fight global, with cases popping up from South Africa to Turkey. 

In one wild twist, South Africa’s High Court even approved the seizure of some Google assets, part of a broader Russian push to target Western companies ignoring local rulings.

**When Courts Become Weapons**  
  
Legal experts are calling this “lawfare”—using courts as geopolitical pawns. Russia’s recent laws let its courts go after Western companies as payback for sanctions, and as the fines pile up, experts warn this is just the start. 

The ongoing fines, doubling weekly, represent a fundamental shift in how international companies are forced to think about geopolitical risk, especially as Russian and Western courts butt heads.

**Just a Symbolic Sting?**  
  
Google, for its part, is playing it cool, saying these legal hurdles won’t hit the bottom line. Alphabet shares held steady, reflecting Wall Street’s confidence that these fines won’t put a dent in the company’s trillion-dollar valuation. 

For now, Google is calling Russia’s bluff—but with fines stacking up, it’s clear the stakes are high if this legal storm doesn’t blow over.

# Tomorrow

Brace yourselves: the US jobs report is coming, and it’s the one that could make or break the markets…again. This is the same report that sent shockwaves in August, and if October’s numbers fall short, we might be in for a repeat. Economists are projecting just 120,000 new jobs, a major dip from September’s jaw-dropping 254,000. And thanks to hurricanes and strikes muddying the picture, no one’s totally sure what to expect. The unemployment rate? It’s expected to hang tight at 4.1%.

Luckily, the earnings frenzy has calmed down a bit, so Friday’s looking pretty chill—unless, of course, the job numbers stir the pot."

# Election Day Showdown: Trump vs. Harris And Your Portfolio

It’s finally Election Day, and after a campaign season that brought us viral squirrels, bear sightings, and unexpected pet memes, we’re getting back to the real talk: What does this mean for the economy? 

Trump and Harris are pitching policies that could shake up your portfolio—here’s a breakdown of their promises, from taxes to trade and everything in between.

**Big Tax Moves**

Both candidates are waving different tax flags. Harris wants to roll the corporate tax rate up to 28%, targeting high earners with a minimum 25% tax on mega-wealth (those with over $100 million) and boosting capital gains for millionaires to 28%. 

Trump, on the other hand, aims to lower the corporate rate to 15% for U.S.-based manufacturing and continue the individual and estate tax cuts he pushed in 2017. For big companies, these tax changes could directly affect their bottom lines, impacting market values and shareholder earnings.

**Tariffs & Trade**

Trump's plans are bolder when it comes to tariffs, proposing a 10% across-the-board levy on imports and up to a 200% tariff on Mexican-made cars. The goal? A “Made in America” resurgence, though economists warn this could send prices up across consumer goods. 

Harris hasn’t proposed anything quite as drastic but has hinted she’d maintain Biden-era tariffs. While Trump’s approach is all about pushing U.S. manufacturing, Harris’s steadier stance may appeal to those wary of increased inflation risks.

**What’s Next for Your Portfolio?**

Analysts suggest a Harris administration could benefit clean energy, healthcare, and homebuilding sectors, while Trump could mean gains for oil, financials, and crypto. 

But here’s the kicker: No matter who wins, staying diversified is key. Historically, the market has weathered administrations of all stripes and come out on top, and experts say focusing on long-term investments over election reactions is a winning strategy.

**The Bottom Line:** Campaign rhetoric is one thing; actual policy is another. Congress has a knack for turning grand ideas into smaller compromises, so while the headlines might sound big, the reality might be more tempered. As we head into a period of potential market jitters, a steady hand and a diversified portfolio might be the most presidential decision you can make.

# Boeing Ends Crippling Strike as Workers Accept Latest Offer

After a 53-day standoff, Boeing’s machinists are ready to trade picket signs for power tools again. In a nail-biter of a vote, 59% of union members gave the thumbs-up to a new contract that includes a hefty 38% pay bump over four years. '

Boeing’s production lines can finally get back in gear, which means more jets—and less red ink.

**A Deal That Soars Higher Than a 737**

This new contract is a big win for Boeing’s workforce. We’re talking a 13% instant pay boost, with average salaries climbing to around $119,000 by the end of the deal. Plus, there’s a $12,000 signing bonus to sweeten the pot. 

After years of less-than-stellar raises, machinists have muscled in some major gains—though it did take seven weeks of picketing and freezing fingers to make it happen.

**New CEO, New Strategy, and a Costly Pause**

For Boeing’s new CEO Kelly Ortberg, it’s been a turbulent start. Since August, he’s been cutting costs, raising cash, and trying to stay aloft amid production halts and stock hits. The strike alone was draining Boeing of $100 million a day—something the jet giant could hardly afford as shares plummeted over 40% this year. 

The settlement is welcome news, but getting production back up to speed won’t be instant, especially with 737 MAX orders still lagging.

**What’s Next: Planes, Patience, and Recovery**

Machinists will be back on the factory floor this week, but don’t expect planes to roll out overnight. Boeing’s whole supply chain, from fuselage makers to flight-schedule-hungry airlines, took a hit during the strike.

Ramping up production will take time, and Boeing’s finances are far from stable, with the company still predicting a cash flow drought through 2025.

The bottom line? Boeing may have scored a truce with its workers, but it’s still got plenty of turbulence to ride out on its journey back to cruising altitude.

# Tomorrow

Election Day may be in the rearview, but don’t exhale just yet—the ballot counting marathon is expected to stretch through the week. Get ready for wall-to-wall analysis, endless charts, and enough speculations to fill a football stadium.

But politics isn’t the only headline. Tomorrow, the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee (FOMC) kicks off a two-day meeting. These are the folks steering the ship on interest rates, so all eyes will be on what they decide.

And with the decision dropping Thursday, there’s plenty of time for news channels to keep you entertained with eye-catching graphics and live updates.

# Before Market Open: 

* **Novo Nordisk** reigns supreme in the weight-loss drug market, but staying on top is no small feat when every pharma giant wants a slice of the action. Investors will be eager to hear how management plans to fend off rivals, with hopes pinned on a robust drug pipeline that could shield them from competition. And with pill forms of its popular injectable GLP-1 drugs nearing the market, the timing couldn't be better. Expectations: $0.91 EPS, $10.77 billion in revenue. Earnings drop after the close. ($NVO)

# After Market Close: 

* **Duolingo’s** problem? Too much of a good thing. The language-learning app has soared nearly 90% in the past year, fueled by skyrocketing subscriber growth and a clever AI-powered revamp that lets them charge extra. But with shares now highly priced, investors are wondering if it’s too steep to keep snapping up. No signs of slowing subscription growth yet, but that valuation could be the elephant in the room. Expectations: $0.35 EPS, $189.16 million in revenue. ($DUOL)"

# Tesla Hits $1 Trillion Amid Trump Win

Tesla's back in the trillion-dollar club. Shares skyrocketed 8% Friday, pushing its market cap over the $1 trillion threshold as investors jumped on the potential for looser regulations in a Trump administration. 

Elon Musk, Trump’s most vocal supporter and a generous campaign contributor, saw Tesla surge about 30% this week alone. With hints at slashing electric vehicle subsidies and potential trade barriers for Chinese EV players, Wall Street sees a Trump-Musk partnership as a boon for Tesla’s market share in the U.S.

**A Boost for Musk’s Billions**

The Tesla rally has also catapulted Musk’s net worth past $300 billion, marking his highest fortune since 2021. Musk has been outspoken about leveraging his influence in Trump’s administration to accelerate federal approval for autonomous vehicles, a critical step for Tesla’s self-driving ambitions. 

The partnership comes at a strategic moment, with Tesla now vying against Alphabet-owned Waymo in the autonomous driving race.

**Trump Trade Implications for Tesla’s Competitors**

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives noted that Trump’s pro-business stance could place Musk in a highly favorable position, shielding Tesla from new EV subsidies that have leveled the field for foreign competitors. 

Meanwhile, U.S. rivals and industry giants like Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft now sit alongside Tesla in the trillion-dollar tech club, with Wall Street eagerly eyeing who will come out on top in this new era of deregulation.

* 🚀 **Tesla Hits $1 Trillion Mark:** Tesla shares soared 8% on Friday, elevating the EV giant’s market cap above $1 trillion.

# Retailers Are Prepping For Tariffs

Trump’s back in office, and with him comes a tariff policy that’s sending ripples through retail. With proposed tariffs up to 20% on all imports and a jaw-dropping 100% on goods from China, retailers are facing a fresh dilemma: absorb these costs or pass them onto consumers. 

According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), these tariffs could add up to $7,600 in annual costs for American households, leading to what the NRF warns could be a “tax on American families.” Retail stocks like Dollar General and Five Below have already started to feel the heat, dropping as much as 10% this week as they brace for rising expenses and tightening margins.

**Consumer Prices in the Crosshairs**

Retailers are in a bind: either eat the extra costs or send prices soaring. The NRF predicts these tariffs could zap as much as $78 billion in consumer spending each year if fully enacted. Price hikes in double digits are on the horizon for categories like apparel, electronics, and household items, hitting customers’ wallets hard. 

Stores that rely heavily on China for sourcing—like Five Below, Crocs, and Skechers—are particularly exposed, while discount chains worry that price jumps could scare away budget-conscious shoppers.

**Winners, Losers, and Tariff-Proofing Strategies**

Not every retailer is biting their nails. Giants like Amazon and Walmart, with massive buying power and diverse supply chains, are poised to weather the tariff storm. Meanwhile, brands like Steve Madden, already seasoned from Trump’s first tariff stint, have reduced reliance on China by nearly half to sidestep a hit. 

As some retailers scramble, those who’ve diversified early may have a head start in staying ahead of what’s shaping up to be another trade showdown.

# Spirit Airlines Braces for Bankruptcy

Spirit Airlines is flirting with bankruptcy after a last-ditch merger attempt with Frontier fizzled out. 

The ultra-budget airline is now in talks with creditors on a restructuring plan that would potentially wipe out its equity holders, sending Spirit’s stock plummeting over 59% on Wednesday. 

So, if you’re holding Spirit shares, let’s just say it might be time to buckle up.

# Grounded Merger Plans Leave Spirit Scrambling

Merger hopes were high for Spirit after talks with both JetBlue and Frontier put a lifeline in sight. But after JetBlue’s bid got axed by antitrust concerns, Frontier was the next best hope – until now. 

With that deal grounded, Spirit is left scrambling to negotiate its survival with bondholders. Analysts say that without a merger, Spirit may need to sell off aircraft and other assets to handle its hefty debt load, giving bondholders the upper hand over shareholders in any final deal.

# Trimming Wings to Stay Afloat

Already in belt-tightening mode, Spirit’s been trimming its fleet, furloughing pilots, and offloading older planes in a bid to free up cash. 

Yet, with a hefty $1.1 billion bond deadline on the horizon, the airline’s runway is looking short. Wall Street’s not holding its breath: with zero “buy” ratings and eight “sell” recommendations, the consensus seems clear. 

Now, it’s a waiting game to see if Spirit can emerge from this nosedive intact.

# Amazon Takes On Temu and Shein With Discount ‘Amazon Haul’ store

Amazon is making a play for the ultra-low-price crowd with its latest launch, *Amazon Haul*. Simply type “haul” into your amazon app and hit enter.

Touted as an affordable answer to Temu and Shein, Haul features a selection of everyday items capped at $20, with many under $10. In this new section, you’ll find deals like $1 iPhone cases and $5 packs of holiday socks. 

But there’s a trade-off: while Amazon has long been known for its quick Prime delivery, Haul shoppers will need to wait a bit—deliveries clock in at one to two weeks, mirroring the timelines of its Chinese rivals.

# Discounts Stack as Baskets Grow

To sweeten the deal, Amazon is offering extra discounts for larger orders, with 5% off for purchases over $50 and 10% off over $75, plus free shipping on orders above $25. 

The Haul selection covers a broad range of categories—from fashion and home goods to electronics and lifestyle items—all with an eye-catching “crazy low” price tag. Amazon’s VP of Worldwide Selling Partner Services, Dharmesh Mehta, says Haul is designed for those willing to wait a little longer to save a lot more, adding some fun and affordability to Amazon’s app experience.

It’s a clear signal that Amazon is targeting shoppers who prioritize deals over delivery speed.

# Playing the Long Game on Low Prices

Haul isn’t just a new section; it’s Amazon’s response to the rise of bargain-focused apps like Temu, which are chipping away at the traditional e-commerce model with rock-bottom pricing. 

Amazon’s willingness to take the slow lane on delivery suggests a bet on customers who are still more comfortable shopping with a familiar brand but are willing to explore lower-cost options. With all products screened for compliance, 

Amazon is aiming to sidestep the counterfeits and regulatory issues dogging Temu and Shein, providing Haul shoppers a budget-friendly and trustworthy shopping experience.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s got two big numbers on deck: first up, initial jobless claims—a quick check on the labor market’s pulse, which is still front and center in the Fed’s rate-cutting game plan. Expect last month’s hurricane chaos and labor strikes to show up here, so don’t be surprised if the numbers look rough. Jerome Powell likely won’t hit the brakes just yet.

We’ll also see the Producer Price Index (PPI), which shows inflation from the perspective of producers, not shoppers. Manufacturers have been taking it on the chin lately with rising costs and rates, but last month’s flat reading sparked a bit of hope that things might be stabilizing.

# Before Market Open:

* **Disney** in trouble? Hard to imagine, but even the House of Mouse isn’t immune to a few hiccups. Box office numbers are soft, hurricanes put theme parks on pause, streaming growth is underwhelming, and sky-high sports rights are squeezing profits.

# Vaccine Stocks Catch a Cold on Kennedy's Nomination

Vaccine stocks felt the pain Thursday after President-elect Trump tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal vaccine skeptic, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 

With Kennedy’s track record of challenging vaccine safety, investors quickly hit sell on big names. Moderna ($MRNA) slid 5.6%, Novavax ($NVAX) lost 7%, while Pfizer ($PFE) and BioNTech ($BNTX) joined the red tide. 

The market’s verdict? Kennedy’s policies could shake up the sector, potentially eroding public confidence and tightening regulations.

**Uncertain Times for Vaccine Makers**  
  
For an industry already coping with waning COVID-19 vaccine demand, Kennedy’s HHS role injects new uncertainty. His anti-vaccine advocacy—and leadership of Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vax group—has industry players and investors bracing for possible policy headwinds. 

Vaccine manufacturers now face the risk of reduced immunization rates, which could pressure their bottom lines even further.

**Biotech Takes Note**  
  
Kennedy’s views extend beyond vaccines, casting a shadow over the wider biotech sector. With his skepticism about pharmaceutical companies, market watchers anticipate potential shifts in health policy that could impact drug development, approval timelines, and sales. 

Analysts are on alert, viewing Kennedy’s influence as a wildcard that could affect drugmakers’ performance across the board.

**Stock Market Reaction**  
  
The market is clearly concerned, and health stocks could be in for a bumpy ride if Kennedy’s nomination is confirmed. 

With his anti-establishment approach, the biotech and vaccine sectors might see a heightened level of volatility, as investors weigh the long-term effects of Kennedy’s potential policy pivots on the healthcare landscape.
