Now, this time‚Äôs different. $NVDA","NVDA may hold promise for the future, but its current Price to Earnings (PE) and Price to Sales (PS) ratios are less than impressive. Earnings appear stagnant, with PC gaming in decline. The majority of their profit is derived from data services, rather than Al.

Moreover, we're grappling with the debt ceiling limit. When analyzing patterns from past 'blood weeks', history shows NVDA experienced a 30% drop during such events. The economic outlook is not favorable and there's a downward trend, as evidenced by the overvaluation of PPD. Despite being hyped and exceeding $100 due to strong buying pressure for a significant period, it now faces a 40% reduction.

Add to that the ongoing uncertainty around the China trade war, and you have a multitude of reasons contributing to a potential decrease in the stock's value.

Disclosure: I hold over 17k short positions in NVDA. My investment track record is far from flawless - I lost approximately 80k last March and, to date, Fidelity has yet to retrieve my funds. So, my struggles in the market are evident. Let's proceed."

I lost big time on PYPL play. I lost 10k on NVDA earnings. I'm generally a bear because in falling market you make gains much quicker than in bull runs. No one is ever panic buying as much as people tend to panic sell. I know that I was right, I was just early. Now I'm back. Call it copium and delusional regardery if you want. I do believe NVDA is a good company with good future ahead and I wish I owned it long term before the hype, don't get me wrong. But the hype is too much and unsustainable continuously. I believe NVDA will be doing good long-term and might even get to the $800-1000 territory eventually. But I'm betting my all-time gains from trading and then some on the fact that it will tank one more time in terms of a correction, reversing to the mean and becoming ""normal"" after which it will steadily go up as it's fundamentally a good stock. When the bears will have that one last attempt to beat it down, that's when I won't be as stupid as I was with PayPal, I will cease my chance and I will cash out.

Beware this is my get lambo or get slaughtered like a lamb kind of a deal and I'm fully aware of it. There's nothing in between. If I lose, I'll be rotting in my day job the same way. If I win, I'll finger fuck all of them bastards and retire. I'm risking amount that might make me much poorer but not ruined, so never risk what you can't lose to the point where there's no other solution than buying calls for $ROPE. I don't recommend anyone to replicate this as it's high regarded territory, it's against the trend and the hype...

2024-01-25 19:10:42,rayrayrex,Bullish on NVDA after Intel Guidance,"As many of you know the Intel guidance dropped and it‚Äôs had an impact on NVDA and AMD respectively. The issue here is that intels drop in demand is for specifically for ‚Äúchips used in the traditional server and personal computer markets‚Äù. https://www.reuters.com/technology/chipmaker-intel-forecasts-quarterly-revenue-below-estimates-2024-01-25/

That is to say nothing to do with the AI chips that NVDA and AMD are building on their inventory which the hype is blasting off of. 

In a separate statement the CEO goes on to say that they expect ‚Äú$2 billion worth of orders for its AI chips and expects better sales later in the year‚Äù.

Who gives a damn if their laptop and server business is dying? The future is AI. The drop we‚Äôre seeing in aftermarket for both NVDA and AMD is unrelated to what they are producing compared to Intel.

With NVDA expecting 20 billion in revenue it‚Äôs absurd to correlate the dying performance of one company with the stellar sales of another.

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-nvda-what-to-expect-in-2024#

Now I understand the market is irrational and there will most likely be a dip on open but it really don‚Äôt make any sense to me. The loss in revenue from Intel is correlated with the absurd growth Nvidia has been having. 

With a 1.1 trillion valuation the computing power and software to boot, I think if anything a decline in intel should be a sign of the absurd market dominance NVDA has.

Back in late July/early August, I entered the following trade: Long Feb 16 NVDA $520c. Short on Dec 15 NVDA $525c. 60 contracts. This cost me like $75k. As the Dec 15 was about to expire, I closed the whole position for $17.5k gain (a little over 20%). Not bad, I suppose. However, had I not sold the Feb 16 $520c (the Dec 15 $525c was about to expire worthless), the position I sold for $93k would now be worth $1.1m.

2024-02-08 17:08:47,rayrayrex,NVDA will drop into the 670‚Äôs tomorrow because,"1. No more catalysts from other companies to artificially boost interest. With volume decreasing day over day and price falling, a reversal is likely given the failed push past $700

2. Competition from ARM has actually had a negative impact on NVIDIA‚Äôs stock today as investors flocked to alternatives, while ARM continued to rise. The original boost on Thursday was far more likely attributed to Morgan Stanley increasing their price target $750

3. Every Thursday of this year if the stock went sideways/decreased into the end of the day, the stock would drop $15-20 the next day (save for catalysts from other corps - which aren‚Äôt coming). Similar pattern can be seen on any chart where NVDA has declined or traded flat the previous day 

4. Institutional investors are not going to be buying anymore stock knowing a sharp correction is imminent 2 weeks out. They will be far more inclined to lock profit in and sell as the price dips and corrects before buying back in the 70-80‚Äôs.

4.5. NVDA‚Äôs previous guidance is going to screw them at earnings as the market has expectations beyond anything they themselves broadcasted, which will lead to a correction down to the mid 600‚Äôs

‚Äã‚ÄãSam Altman was already trying to lead the development of human-level artificial intelligence. Now he has another great ambition: raising trillions of dollars to reshape the global semiconductor industry.

The OpenAI chief executive officer is in talks with investors including the United Arab Emirates government to raise funds for a wildly ambitious tech initiative that would boost the world‚Äôs chip-building capacity, expand its ability to power AI, among other things, and cost several trillion dollars, according to people familiar with the matter. The project could require raising as much as $5 trillion to $7 trillion, one of the people said.¬†

The fundraising plans, which face significant obstacles, are aimed at solving constraints to OpenAI‚Äôs growth, including the scarcity of the pricey AI chips required to train [large language models](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-new-jobs-for-humans-in-the-ai-era-db7d8acd) behind AI systems such as ChatGPT.

2024-02-09 07:57:22,plutrons,NVDA has to pull back right?,
2024-02-09 13:47:18,rayrayrex,NVDA will fall on Monday to 700 because,"1. We are facing resistance at 720 which signals a retracing with the decreasing volume. This has historically always been followed by a fall of 1-3%

2. Anytime the stock has soared 15-20$ it is followed by a sideways movement in the market followed by a drop. Since institutional investors are aware we know this, they will sell off a day early on Monday instead of Tuesday

3. There‚Äôs no more catalysts coming up. Today‚Äôs boom was brought on by the announcement of their custom chip segment which is now already priced in. They cannot have any more surprises ahead of earnings without risking a boost in price beyond analyst forecasts which causes their price to crater

4. Institutional investors saw my last post listing a decrease in price and bought in droves to drive out what they perceive as the majority of WSB investors. Since the OG meme stock they have been scared of us and actively use the sentiment in our posts to bet against us. It had over 500k impressions meaning it was definitely on their radar

5. Basic game theory: earnings will be nowhere close to the expectations of the guidance given by NVDA, and institutional investors know this. As such the usual approach where buying options 2 weeks ahead of earnings to capitalize on volatility is moot. It‚Äôs a race against time to see which big player sells first while they try to maximize their gains. Once one player sells, it will trigger a cascading effect causing the price to drop fast. We could see 690‚Äôs

6. I bought calls expiring 2/16 at $690

7. I want to double down on institutional investors being aware of this post. They will sell off/trade side ways to go against the trending posts in this sub

* a $100 risk could be $5K (if the stock price gets trimmed 50%)
* not financial advice, do your own research

edit:  I want to point this out.  I know this sub is more about yolo and risking large amounts.  I don't take that approach.  I look for skews where my risk is minimal and the reward is maximal.  NVDA could very well have a blow off top and run to $1k.  None of us know.  But if you're only risking $100 (to potentially make $5K), then who the hell cares?  Minimizing your risk also allows you to take more plays.  So for example, if you had 3 plays with 1:3 risk:reward skewed, you'd only have to be right 30% of the time to be at breakeven."

As you can see from this fine graphic, NVDA's free cash-flow per share (the Tony Montana of financial metrics) coincides with the exponential rise in stock price.

For perspective, here are the free cash flows per share of NVDA and some AI contenders:

NVDA = $7.10

AMD = $0.15 (bruh)

INTEL = $-0.48 (lololololol)

ARM = $0.65

As the chart shows, NVDA can out-invest and out-expand its competitors.

It's scientifically proven.

To put that in further perspective:

**THIS IS WAR - And Nvidia is the United States Military Industrial Complex, The Mongol Empire, and Roma combined.**

AI will be as large as the internet and then it will surpass it. AI is the internet plus the ability to reason and analyze anything you give it in fractions of a second. A new unequivocal boomstick to whomever wants to use it.

The true winners will be those startups in fields such as robotics, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, space-aeronautics, aviation, protein synthesis, new materials and so, so much more who will use AI in new and exciting ways.

Boston dynamics, set to boom. Self-driving robotaxis, set to boom. Flying taxis, set to boom. Job replacement/automation for legacy industry jobs white collar, set to boom. Personal AI agents for your individual workloads, booming. Healthcare change as we know it (doctors won't like this but too bad), set to boom.

The amount of industry that is set to shift and mutate and emerge from AI in the next 3 - 5 years will be astonishing.

I can tell you, standing on principal, that OpenAI's next release will be so game changing that nobody will deny where AI is heading. There is not a rock you can hide under to be so oblivious as to not see where this is going.

The reason why I bring up the next iteration of ChatGPT, GPT5, is because they are initiators of this phenomenon. Other, such as Google (and others) are furiously trying to catch up but as of today the 'MOAT' may be upon us.

The reason to believe that one may catch up (or try like hell to) is from the amount of compute power from GPU's it takes to train an ungodly amount of data. Trillions of data points. Billions (soon to be Trillions) of parameters all simulating that of the synaptic neuron connections in which the human brain functions that in turn gives us the spark of life and consciousness. Make no mistake, these guys are living out a present day Manhattan project.

These people are trying to build consciousness agency with the all the world's information as a reference document at it's finger tips. Today.

And guess what. The only way these guys can build that thing - That AGI/ASI/GAI reality - Is through Nvidia.

These guys believe and have tested that if you throw MORE compute at the problem it actually GAINS function. More compute equals more consciousness. That's what these people believe and they're attempting it.

Here, let me show you what I mean. What the graph below shows is that over time the amount of data and parameters that are being used to train an AI model. I implore you to watch this video as it is a great easy to understand educational video into what the hell is going on with all of this AI stuff. It's a little technical but very informative and there are varying opinions. I pulled out the very best part in relation to Nvidia here. [AI: Grappling with a New Kind of Intelligence](https://youtu.be/EGDG3hgPNp8?si=L71CUbmqho3jhKEh&t=3768)

https://preview.redd.it/vk5twc041hic1.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3d2bdf42cf25e1c04e940b2f61d0219871f2334

It's SO RIDICULOUS that you wouldn't be able to continue to see the beginning so they have to use a log plot chart. And as you see we are heading into Trillions of parameters. For reference GPT-4 was trained on roughly 200 billion parameters.

https://preview.redd.it/6cq17n5i1hic1.png?width=1327&format=png&auto=webp&s=830334aa7cdaddfa10d7f6512d10025f136076ed

It is estimated GPT-5 will be trained with 2-5 trillion parameters.

Sam Altman was dead ass serious when he is inquiring about obtaining $7 trillion for chip development. They believe that with enough compute they can create GOD.

So what's the response from Google, Meta and others. Well, they're forming ""AI """"Alliances"""""". Along with that they are going to and buying from the largest AI arms dealer on earth; Nvidia.

Nvidia is a common day AI Industrial Complex War machine.

**Sovereign AI with AI Foundries**

It's not just companies that are looking to compete it's also entire Nation States. Remember, when Italy banned GPT. Well, it turns out, countries don't want the United States building and implementing their AI into other country's culture and way of life.

So as of today, you have a battle of not just corporate America but entire countries looking to buy the bullets, tanks and missiles needed for this AI fight. Nvidia sells the absolute best bullets, the best guns, the best ammo one needs to attempt to create their own AI epicenters.

And it's so important that it is a national security risk to not just us the United States but to be a nation and not have the capability of AI.

Remember the leak about Q\* and a certain encryption being undone. You don't think heads of State where listening to that. Whether it was true or not it is now an imperative that you get with AI or get left behind. That goes just as much for a nation as it does for you as an individual.

When asked about the risk of losing out sales to China on Nvidia's last earnings call Jensen Huang clearly stated he was not worried about it because literally nations are coming online to build AI foundries.

**Nvidia's Numbers and The Power Of Compounding**

The power of compounding and why I think there share price is where it is today and has so much more room to grow. Let me ask you a question but first let me say that AWS's annual revenues are at \~$80/Y Billion. How long do you think with Nvidia's revenues of \~$18/Q Billion to reach or eclipse AWS at a 250% growth rate?

15 years? 10 Years? 5 years? Answer: 1.19 years. Ok let's not be ridiculous perhaps it's 200% instead.

5 years? Nope. 1.35 years.

Let's say they have a bad quarter and Italy doesn't pay up. 150%

5 years right? Nope. 1.62 years.

Come on they can't keep this up. 100%.

has to be 5 years this time. Nope. 2.15 years.

100% growth/2.15 years to 250% growth/1.19 years to reach 80 billion in annual revenues.

They're growth last year was 281%.

So wait, I wasn't being fair. I used $80 billion for AWS while their revenues last year where $88 Billion and Nvidia's last years 4 quarters where \~$33 Billion.

Here are those growth numbers it would take Nvidia to reach $88 billion.

At 279% =  0.73 years

At 250% = 0.78 years

At 200% = 0.89 years

at 100% = 1.41 years

Folks. That's JUST the data center. They are poised to surpass AWS, Azure and Google Cloud in about .73 to 1.5 years. Yes, you heard that right, your daddy's cloud company is about to be overtaken by your son's gaming GPU company.

When people say Nvidia is undervalued. This is what they are talking about. This is a P/S story not a P/E story.

[https:\/\/ycharts.com\/indicators\/nvidia\_corp\_nvda\_data\_center\_revenue\_quarterly](https://preview.redd.it/xa46amh0dhic1.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e9116e55235991b1113713b5b7cd7d30c58d515)

This isn't Y2k and the AI ""dot-com"" bubble. **This is a reckoning.** This is the largest transfer of wealth the world has ever seen.

Look at the graph. Look at the growth. That's all before the next iteration of GPT-5 has even been announced.

I will tell you personally. The things that will be built with GPT-5 will truly be mind blowing. That Jetson cartoon some of you may have watched as a kid will finally be a reality coming to you soon in 2024/2025/2026.

The foundation of work being laid now is only the beginning. There will be winners and there will be loser but as of today:

**$NVDA** is fucking **KING**

For those of you who still just don't believe or are thinking this has to end sometimes. Or fucking Cramer who keeps saying be careful and take some money out and on and on. Think about this.

It costs you to just open an enterprise Nvidia data center account \~$50k via a ""limited time offer""

To train a model a major LLM could cost millions who knows maybe for the largest model runs BILLIONS.

Everyone is using them from Nation States to AWS, Microsoft, Meta, Google, X. Everybody is using them.

I get it. The price of the stock being so high and the valuation makes you pause. The price is purely psychological especially when they are hitting so many data points regarding revenues. The stock will split and rightly so (perhaps next year) but make not mistake this company is firing on ALL cylinders. The are executing S Tier. Fucking Max 9000 MX9+ Tier. Some god level tier ok.

There will be shit money that hits this quarter with all the puts and calls. The stock may rescind this quarter who knows. All i'm saying is you have the opportunity to buy into one of the most prolific tech companies the world has ever known. You may not think of them as the Apples or the Amazons or the Microsoft's or the Google's and that's ok. Just know that they are 1000% percent legit and AI has just gotten started.

Position: 33% of my portfolio. Another 33% in$Arm. Why? Because What trains on Nvidia will ultimately run/inference on ARM. And 33% Microsoft (OAI light).

If OpenAI came out today public I would have %50 of my portfolio in OAI i'll tell you that.

This is something you should have and should own in your portfolio. It's up to you to decide how much. When you can pay your children's college. When you can finally get that downpayment on that dream house. When you can buy that dream car you've always wanted. Feel free to drop a thank you.

TLDR; BUY NVIDIA, SMCI and ARM. This is not financial advice. The contents of this advertisement where paid by the following... ARM (;)"
2024-02-14 09:05:38,AcrobaticDependent35,Shorting NVDA at 740 is literally free money at this point,"**Why**

The expectation is that they greatly exceed earnings - so even if they do, the pop won't be anything insane, maybe 6-8% or so. That's probably what's going to happen.

However. If they even slightly falter, then it's going to crater 10-15% at a minimum - I see 650 as a reasonable spot to exit honestly.

I'm just seeing all of the little slots on SoFi that dozens and dozens of people are buying in and it feels like they're lambs being brought to slaughter. Double top, majority of investors only in it for the momentum (which has been waning the last few days), Google's chips, so many reasons for it to fall and for it to fall \_now\_.

I'm a software engineer at an AI startup and yeah I see the insane costs/demand for these but it's a \_hardware\_ company and not software that can scale infinitely at no marginal cost. Now that I think about it, I really think I should've invested in it when I first saw that side of things but now I'm just doing it out of spite. Or that the one other big short I did was COIN from 180 => 150 and this feels the same sentiment-wise. idk either way works

**Positions**

* (-20) NVDA @ 705 - 134% of that account, started on 02-06
* 200 NVD @ 8.95 fifteen minutes ago
* Other more reasonable choices

**Afterword**

Well in the time I wrote this it fell from 740 to 727 so never mind I guess, it's slightly less profitable of a trade but the point still stands (which is left as an exercise for the reader)

**Edit**

[This account](https://preview.redd.it/5spcopmb3lic1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6420b7f09a517d74c6dde2846422073376fd5ca)

**Edit 2**

* Closed NVD @ 9.27

**Edit 3**

* Y'all - It is just money guys and here's the thing: I don't lose when it is worth more than my account (cause it already is). I lose when the *losses* are worth more than my account. Just going to hold through earnings, any losses are offset by the money market interest anyways

**Edit 4**

* NVD is 1.5x inverse NVDA. I did not close the NVDA lol  


**Edit 5**

* My oh my the bullish comments have slowed down! What happened?!? 
* Anyways those were kind of proving my point. The price reflected something like 99% chance of maintaining zero competition and continuing the insane growth for like a decade. That's true that's what it looks like now, and I feel like the underlying facts are going to change soon for its valuation. The price reflected something like a 99% chance of absolutely demolishing earnings and didn't leave a lot of upside for if they even do. 
* Also, I felt like that was the reverse sort of effect happening - only people buying at that level were shorts capitalizing and it's kind of like how we hit a super-bottom in 2022 from margin calls. Shorts have already \*been\* getting wrecked which is why it was a better entry at 740 than say 500.
* I can't even drink yet so stop trying to flex your buys from when I was in middle school lol"

The bull case seems clear: the rapidly growing demand for semiconductors with AI/ML-capabilities to use in Data Centers (DC). Pretty much every large tech company is buying up land for DCs, such as in Northern Virginia, and are releasing plans to buy tons of NVDA chips for their new DCs and to upgrade their old DCs. Congress is also choosing NVDA as their favorite chip-maker, forbidding them from selling premier chips to China, presumably to use NVDA for defense-related cyber operations, creating a future for significant government demand. Gen-AI was the catalyst, but machine learning and government cyberops is the demand. Concerning its price, anyone can tell you how NVDA is still cheap relative to other chip-makers by forward p/e.

So far, the posts here that warn of an ‚Äúimminent NVDA crash‚Äù are all pseudo-investing‚Ä¶ not one discusses flaws in their business strategy. The argument range from ‚Äúan unrelated tech company had a similar rise 20 years ago, and their stock fell after the Internet bubble burst,‚Äù ‚Äúit rose so quickly, so it must be overvalued,‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôve shorted it, so it just has to fall or else I‚Äôm screwed.‚Äù"

I'm 87 and immobile in a wheelchair and don't know anything about semiconductors or anything else technology related. I cannot Google or text, and I currently have someone who lives in my home 24/7 and wipes my ass for me. However, I'm a damn intuitive savant when it comes to tricking gullible kids.

I did grow up in the biggest bull market in human history with some Boomers printing money like Chuck E. Cheese bucks.. and everyone is a genius in a bull market.. Well almost everyone. I didn't invest so now I just scam Millennials and Zoomers.

Anyway, I like talking stocks with my grandson because it‚Äôs something we could connect on, and I have a ton of experience selling worthless advice to idiots. So in 2018 we were talking about the market, and I casually brought up Nvidia. He thought I didn't guide him to that at all. He bought Nvidia in 2017 so he was familiar with it although he bought his shares at 18 yrs old with $2k he had saved up. Nothing insane although he kept 90% to this day. I said I saw NVIDIA in a newspaper article with someone recommending it for elderly‚Äôs retirement accounts. So I told my grandson I was an OGangster, called my broker and bought 1,000 shares on the spot because in my words: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt buy a stock if I can‚Äôt afford 1,000 shares‚Äù. Something only the Zoomers dumb enough to buy meme stocks would fall for. 

He was dumbstruck because here he thought he was doing great with his savings over the years, and I just humbled his ass with a completely made up sentence. Add in the 4:1 stock split, and now he thinks I'm sitting on 4,000 shares. (I ""confirmed"" it to him when he brought it up in the last month). I haven't sold a dime and don't even know what the price is doing day to day because I don't own any shares.  I'm just chilling in my wheelchair and letting him try to get a bigger share of the inheritance. He called and celebrated with me the other day because he transparently wants to get in my will. He thinks I'm already wealthy and dumb enough to drop 6 figures on a stock I know little about.

He hopes to inherit my wealth someday, but he‚Äôs also a scammy, golddigging SOB and he knows it! Told me ‚Äúhaha you're a genius investor and luck has nothing to do with‚Äù. Thought id share here because I‚Äôm not sharing this IRL, but I find it pretty ironic my dumb ass grandson is outwiping 95% of this sub. Wendy's boys included."

2024-03-06 09:37:49,cbusoh66,"If you missed the NVDA train, buy ARM","Summary: I fully expect Nvidia and Jensen Huang to go after ARM and acquire a (rather large) stake at any moment, possibly as soon as lockup expires next week. If Trump wins election and FTC changes leadership, Nvidia will likely try to acquire ARM outright. 

Background: In late September 2020, [Nvidia announced plans to acquire ARM from Softbank](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion-creating-worlds-premier-computing-company-for-the-age-of-ai) for $40 billion. At that time, NVDA was \~ $400 billion company, 10x the value of ARM. In December 2021, the [FTC sues to block the merger](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger) citing anti-competitive advantages the combined firm would do in the AI race. On February 2022, Nvidia and Softbank announce [the termination of Nvidia acquitition of ARM Holdings](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-softbank-group-announce-termination-of-nvidias-acquisition-of-arm-limited) and Softbank immediately announced plans to IPO ARM. ARM would IPO in September of 2023. 

All the major tech companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, META, Tesla, and many many others) are working to design their own chips, most are based on [ARM architecture](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/11/09/how-arm-gained-chip-dominance-with-apple-nvidia-amazon-and-qualcomm.html) and Jensen Huang sees the writing on the wall. Jensen also knows that his main competitors, including some of the big boys, are also champing at the bit to either get their own stake or prevent Nvidia from cornering the entire market outright. It's a race against the inevitable. 

If Nvidia was successful in acquiring ARM back in 2021, those $40 billion NVDA shares would be worth $220 billion to Softbank today if we go by the 10x valuation metric that both Nvidia and Softbank likely agreed upon back in 2020. 

TL;DR: Missed NVDA run, buy ARM shares or leaps. Not investment advice!

AMD's new chips will be a bit better irrespective of price, and will be twice as good per dollar.

If I got something wrong in the table above, tell me so I can cover my short. I also made stats for INTC's new GPU, but it didn't look as good, so I left them off.

NVDA's high price/sales is justified by their huge margins -- 48% -- which they only have because competition has been non-existent. But that won't last, because they don't have a monopoly, TSMC has the monopoly. It isn't rocket science to run ML models on other GPUs, just nobody does because all non-NVDA chips suck (besides TPUs but GOOG is hoarding those because they didn't make enough of them). But anyone else can send TSMC a reasonable design and get their good GPU chip made, and AMD is finally going to do that. I don't know if it will help AMD, they seem richly valued themselves, but AMD over the decades, periodically sprung ahead in having the best offering in the CPU market over INTC and killed INTC's margins and crashed INTC's share price.

2. NVDA will convert the majority of the worlds workforce into GPUs within the next couple decades

3. NVDA will definitively bring us into a Star Wars era of robotics within the next couple decades

4. NVDA will have deep roots in every industry, including weather, biology, construction, warehousing, logistics, everything

5. Databases will become intelligence generators. AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, ORCL are also going to Jupiter, likely operating as NVDA, erm sorry SKYNET subsidiaries

6. Black leather jackets will indefinitely be the new fashion craze and be perpetually sold out

Long live Jensen Huang, long live NVDA.

2024-03-19 12:34:46,rayrayrex,NVDA will drop to 840 tomorrow,"1. The FOMC meeting is going to be extremely hawkish. No rate cut is coming until August at the earliest and this is due to the insane inflation we‚Äôre seeing both in the states and globally. Japan for the first time in 17 years has raised interest rates which will no doubt raise the cost of goods imported here, making inflation even worse domestically. This is a clear pattern we are seeing globally that will impact prices paid in the US

2. The market has lost enthusiasm for NVDIA in the current economic climate. They had one of the most stellar conferences where they announced they have their hands in every industry, where Wall Street had even raised price targets on them, and what happens? Everyone dumped the stock due to fears stemming from the FOMC meeting. Right now the market is pricing in 3 rate cuts but that just isn‚Äôt possible with the rate of inflation we are at right now. The entire market will tank tomorrow once retail pulls their head out of their behinds and acknowledges the facts 

3. I bought calls

4. Even with all the good news it‚Äôs still months away from actually generating revenue for NVDIA. With high interest rates companies are better off buying bonds than trying to invest in building AI in a desperate attempt to cut costs. Without sufficient capital, big orgs will struggle to pay the hefty price for the newer Blackwell chips (which they won‚Äôt even be able to buy until the summer). As such NVIDA‚Äôs revenue will fall in the current environment and wall street knows this. That‚Äôs why they are pumping the stock while also buying short positions "

He never had a single losing year, and he returned an average of 30% annually to clients. Very few Wall Street money managers have a track record half that good, and that makes Druckenmiller an excellent case study for investors.

Today, he manages his multibillion-dollar fortune through the Duquesne Family Office. As of the quarter ended in December, Druckenmiller had 21.1% of his portfolio invested in two ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. **Nvidia** accounted for 9.1% and **Microsoft** accounted for 12% of his invested assets. The size of those positions is a clear sign of high conviction.

2024-03-31 17:50:35,Ok-Quail4189,NVDA Spread update,"
This is an update from my previous post [‚ÄúAnyone ever gotten this?‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/SOSGImr0kf) 

First, here's the rundown of what happened: So, I had this genius plan to score an ""easy"" $500 by dealing with NVDA options. I sold 10 calls at the $902.5 strike for $2.75 each and hedged with 10 call contracts at the $900 strike that I got for $4.75. Quick math: that's a breakeven at $902, selling for $902.5, netting me a sweet $0.50 per share. 

But here's the kicker, I didn't know you could call your broker until 5:30 PM if your option expires in the money. Long story short, the buyer of my $902.5 strike calls ghosted, leaving me with 1000 shares of NVDA from the expired $900 strike calls and a cash account deficit of $897,813.87. Which is some RH BS because the shares were worth $901,250, but still stressful AF. 

I wasn't thrilled about being on the hook for $1000 for every $1 move in NVDA. But Robinhood's 24-hour market came in clutch. I unloaded those shares on Sunday night at $909.62 a pop, raking in a profit of $7.62 per stock. I probably could have made more if I held but I‚Äôm relieved I‚Äôm out. Crisis averted, tendies secured. üöÄüí∞ü§ë

TLDR: Robinhood told me I owed them almost $900k after I did an NVDA spread without knowing about DNE, so I almost got spread, but got lucky and ended up making $7k or 350% in four days."
2024-04-09 07:41:17,moldyjellybean,"Have your boomer parents or uber started talking about NVDA, AI? Is it time exit this ride.","Preface this with I'm a big NVDA AI fan been on the AI train for years before this

2 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I said they really have no peer in this space. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price.

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/

I was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE

I had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.

Bless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.

EDIT: I just think it‚Äôs way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  

Much like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it‚Äôs very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the ‚Äústreet‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù pivots quickly.  

5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  

https://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

When you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it‚Äôs almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won‚Äôt have large purchases.  No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter.  This business cycles and when it goes down it‚Äôll go down for 2 years and rocket up after when people need to bulk order."

# May 9-10th: the boring drop

Due to ARM's shite guidance, NVDA as well as the rest of the semi-conductors are going to have a cool day tomorrow barring a sizeable increase in jobless claims (more jobless claims = economy doing crap, thus the Fed is more likely to cut interest rates, which Wall Street glazes themselves over). The reason? BS articles like this are being spread by the news that misattributes ARM's increase in pricing to the AI boom (of which it has no relation):

[https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tsmc-morgan-stanley-hikes-pt-on-arm-ai-cpu-boost-3426842](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tsmc-morgan-stanley-hikes-pt-on-arm-ai-cpu-boost-3426842)

Normies eat this shit up and if SPY ain't peaking in the morning we're going to see a decrease or flat market at best bleeding into Friday. 

Call/Put skew further shows that traders are consolidating at $900 into the pre-pre-earnings week:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3wfjhk9dbazc1.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4fa3ea1fa1878a5ee298e5b16d03b5a6a80a9d1

[https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NVDA/VolatilitySkew/](https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NVDA/VolatilitySkew/)

The gist of this is that if we have really good news, NVDA could hit $920 but with poor market news could hit a bottom of $875 by this Friday.

With VIX (a measure of market volatility, which measures fear) being below 16 and hovering around 13, Market Makers are likely to feed into trends and buy dips so this is bullish in the market overall.

# May 13-17th: the slight recovery then deep decline

Heading into next week we are likely to see a recovery in price from the dip this week followed by a decline preceding earnings the following week. Why? Hedging. Wall Street as well as some retail investors are aware that the previous guidances issues were made under completely different macroeconomic expectations. 

Previously we were under the assumption that 3 rate cuts were coming whilst now only 1 possibly? The result is a drop in price akin to the previous earnings cycle but worse, given the poor earnings we've seen from fellow semiconductor manufacturers. 

The previous earnings cycle was actually positive across the board and what did we see?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u3j7wvaqdazc1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=01f638b22d3b0eb198b7d9237993892b15121bd0

Roughly a $75 decline in share price during the week preceding earnings. And this was off of good news in the market. We could see the price hit sub-800 if everyone cashes out all at once in this week, if previous market behavior is anything to go off of.

Depending on CPI on Wednesday and Jobless Claims on Thursday this could be mediated but we shall see. The likely range is 845-895 based on previous volatility around earnings.

# May 20-22nd: Earnings END-GAME

Nvidia will most likely continue it's drop from the previous week but this isn't a problem for us. Why? Because we know NVDA is the shit. I mean it truly is in another league of it's own. It quite literally is the industry standard that only those on the know are aware of. Their platform is what pretty much everyone who trains AI is using and will continue to use due to how optimized it is.

We're talking about the comparison of an iPhone in 2008 to a flimsy flip phone. It's just so much more advanced that they are crushing the competition. This is why regardless of AMD, INTC, SMCI, all of their failures, NVDA will absolutely crush EPS, Revenue, and Guidance. 

[https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/what-is-nvidia-what-do-they-make-ai-artificial-intelligence-rcna140171](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/what-is-nvidia-what-do-they-make-ai-artificial-intelligence-rcna140171)

They are the backbone of all AI training models right now and as it stands, no one is even close to touching them. Thus they will destroy expectations and rebound to even higher highs than Wall Street has expectations for due to their monopoly-like control of the industry. Barring a world war or FTC intervention, there is no way this stock can go down.

They own the supply, so even if a competitor started to purchase nvidia Blackwell cluster, nvidia could just control the amount they sell to said competitor. The simple fact is this: they won and scaling laws say they will always win.

TLDR: NVDA's raising its orders for TSMC by 25% and estimates for GB200 sales have increased by 50%, up to 60k from 40k. Depending on the configuration (NVL36 vs NVL72), each one ranges between $1.8M - $3M. I'll let you regards do the Math.

Positions: leaps

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

*According to reports from the supply chain, TSMC*¬†[*(2330)*](https://money.udn.com/industry/company/2330)¬†*is preparing to start producing NVIDIA‚Äôs latest Blackwell platform architecture graphics processor (GPU) in the near future. In response to strong customer demand, NVIDIA has increased its chip investment in TSMC by 25%, which not only means that the AI ‚Äã‚Äãmarket is booming Unprecedented, it also adds strong momentum to TSMC‚Äôs performance in the second half of the year and leaves the groundwork for raising its full-year outlook.*

*TSMC will hold a legal meeting this Thursday (18th) and is currently in the silent period before the legal meeting. As of yesterday's deadline, no response from TSMC was received.*

*The industry believes that with the news that TSMC has begun producing Blackwell platform architecture graphics processors (GPUs), it means that the countdown to the launch of Huida's AI server equipped with ""the most powerful AI chip on the surface"" will open a new page in the AI ‚Äã‚Äãindustry, and is expected to become TSMC's The Dharma Conference is the focus of heated discussion.*

*Analysts estimate that the average selling price (ASP) of the Huida B100 GPU built on the Blackwell architecture is US$30,000 to US$35,000, and the super chip GB200, which connects the Grace CPU and the B200 GPU in series, is priced between US$60,000 and US$70,000. The U.S. dollar is even higher, which means that Huida-related chips are the most expensive chips that TSMC has ever produced for terminals, and its investment in TSMC's operations is even more anticipated.*

*Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU is known as the ""most powerful AI chip on the planet"". It is equipped with 208 billion transistors and is manufactured using TSMC's customized 4nm process. The GPU die is twice the mask size through a 10TB chip per second. The chip interconnect connects into a single, unified GPU and supports AI training and real-time large language model inference, with models scalable to 10 trillion parameters.*

*According to industry insiders, major international manufacturers such as Amazon, Dell, Google, Meta, and Microsoft will introduce Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU to build AI servers, and the capacity exceeds expectations. To this end, Huida has increased its order for TSMC by about 25%. %.*

*As Huida expands its Blackwell architecture GPU wafer production, in terms of the number of terminal server cabinets, shipments of GB200 NVL72 and GB200 NVL36 server cabinets have increased simultaneously, from the original expected combined shipment of 40,000 units. increased to 60,000 units, an increase of up to 50%, among which the total number of GB200 NVL36 reached 50,000 units.*

*According to industry estimates, the average selling price of the GB200 NVL36 server cabinet is US$1.8 million, and the price of the GB200 NVL72 server cabinet is as high as US$3 million. GB200 NVL36 has 36 super chips GB200, 18 Grace CPUs, and 36 enhanced B200 GPUs; GB200 NVL72 has 72 super chips GB200, 36 Grace CPUs, and 72 B200 GPUs.*

*Before the handover of the leadership in June, former TSMC Chairman Liu Deyin predicted that the demand for AI applications is now more optimistic than a year ago. ""This year is another year of great growth."" Current Chairman Wei Zhejia also revealed that AI applications have just begun. , ""I'm as optimistic as everyone else.""*"

Just know these two facts: 

a) Cramer said everyone wants out of NVDA today

b) Cathie Woods doesn‚Äôt own NVDA 

There are people who‚Äôve made fortunes simply inversing Cramer especially when it comes to plays on popular stocks. Cramer said he was short NVDA during September 2022 (will post video link to this in comments). On July 9, 2024, Cramer tweeted out ‚ÄúNvidia about to break out from the churn post stock split?‚Äù. The same week NVDA went from 135 to 127 and has been going down since. It will now do the opposite and I‚Äôm expecting a major pump already tomorrow on Friday. 

As for Cathie, as everyone knows, she sold most of her NVDA holdings when it was below $15 per share post split. And yet somehow, she gets to manage billions.

2024-07-26 08:39:51,CaspeanSea,"Chip Stocks Are Bottoming, Including $NVDA.","[$SMH Index](https://preview.redd.it/z0kvqxplrved1.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2a54e1542a799449622a66a7fa5db97052c6e7a)

Just a quick preface, if you don't like technical analysis then skip this one. It's not DD based on fundamentals, it's just technicals. The fundamentals for chip makers ( especially market leaders such as NVDA ) remain the same and remain positive. So I'm only looking at the technical aspect here, because the fundamentals haven't changed, yet.

This is the daily chart for $SMH, the semiconductors index ( chip makers ) ETF.  
Semiconductors formed a double top in early July. A bearish technical structure that often indicates more downside is ahead.  
Double tops form all the time, but unless they're confirmed they're usually harmless.

A double top is confirmed when price closes below the neckline ( the purple line ). This happened on July 17th. As soon as that happens we can extrapolate a full measured move. It's basically a price target that's equal to the distance between the top and the neckline. ( the vertical blue line you see is the full measured move )  
If you take that distance and you place it below the neckline you get the downside target for this technical structure.

As of yesterday, we have hit this downside target.

A similar but slightly different bearish structure also formed when chip stocks topped in March-April. It wasn't a double top, but a slightly different variation. That looks like a spike, then an inverted cup. The spike represents euphoria and the inverted cup represents buyers trying to get going again to crack through the highs, but failing to get momentum going and eventually they give up and sell and it results in a sharp sell off and a bottom. Chip stocks also bottomed right around the full measured move down from the neckline back then. And it's happening again.

This will sound a lot like meaningless mumbo jumbo reading tea leaves or astrology.  In reality technical analysis works for two main reasons.  
1- It's just a representation of investor sentiment and psychology. Just like an ECG is a chart of your heartbeat.  
There's no fortune telling, there's no clairvoyance. It's just putting market psychology in defined, measurable numbers on a chart.  
2- It works because everyone uses the same concepts. Just like I saw this double top and full measured move, every technical analyst at every big bank will have seen the same thing and came to the same conclusion.

I plan to build an aggressive position once an S&P 500 bottom is confirmed. We're getting very close here, probably just days away. I don't want to buy any chip stock until the S&P 500 bottoms. So for now, just waiting patiently."

1) There seems to be no end in sight with Jensen‚Äôs scheduled sells. This matters because volume has been pretty low based on NVDA standards. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only 250k sells though. He has 99% of his equity left‚Äù. It‚Äôs been 250k sells everyday since June. You do the math. 


2) Look at the chart. NVDA reached a double top over the summer - a double peak always results in a sustained decline until it finds consolidation for a period of time. This is exactly what‚Äôs been happening.


3) The delay in Blackwell chip rollout is a big deal. In the past NVDA has hit on all cylinders. A trustworthy company yet this delay is a chink in the armor, a crack in the foundation, like seeing blood after your hero gets a paper cut.


4) Institutions aren‚Äôt buying. There is too much uncertainty with the broader market and it serves MMs well to depress the price in order to allow big money to buy in at lower prices. You all are trading amongst yourselves and buying Jensen‚Äôs bags. It‚Äôs that simple.


My position: 8/30 100 $90 strike puts. Good luck to me.

2024-08-11 08:33:52,NotBanksy69,It‚Äôs time we acknowledge that calls and longs are the play for NVDA. Long DD.,"No pun intended but this will not take long. Please accept this simple DD on why you should be longing NVDA leading up to earnings. 


1) There seems to be no end in sight with Jensen‚Äôs ability to juice earnings releases. Is it the leather jacket? No. Well we don‚Äôt know for sure, but the last six ERs have resulted in an average reaction of roughly +8.5%. Isn‚Äôt that what Buffet earns on an annual basis?


2) Look at the chart. I‚Äôm not usually one for technical analysis, but it‚Äôs quite clear reviewing the chart on my Apple iPhone‚Äôs stocks app that we‚Äôve reached the bottom of this selloff. Image attached for your reference. 


3) The delay in Blackwell chip rollout is not a big deal if it‚Äôs even real. Jensen has been clear that demand for Hopper still exceeds supply. Someone did the math previously, but any impact of a 3 month delay is mitigated by the fact that they‚Äôll simply sell more H200. Just Google ‚ÄúBlackwell delay‚Äù and you‚Äôll see lots of articles on sites you‚Äôve never heard of confirming the same.


4. Nancy Pelosi is still buying. She‚Äôs probably already seen the AGI locked in Sam‚Äôs basement. Don‚Äôt forget, this entire AI wave was kicked off by ChatGPT. That‚Äôs just the very tip of the AI iceberg that‚Äôs about to change the course of humanity‚Äôs future. Any upcoming product releases from the big players in this space are only going to reignite excitement for this technology and thusly shares of NVDA.


My position: Very sensible 9/20 $100 and 12/20 $110 strike calls, shares. Not financial advice. Thank you for reading."

2024-08-14 22:46:25,notyourregularninja,Why NVDA will be $140+ by end of month,"Why NVDA will again hit $140+ right after earnings is because it has been ordering chips heavily that has supplier companies such as TSMC increase revenue by 44% YOY even when nvidia is trying to diversify its supply chain.

Then when my port gained 8k in a day and reached 30k the March 8 correction hit. I panic sold and got fooled by volatility buying more calls.

That was in the brokerage though. May comes around and I full port the IRA into more calls. Whole account across brokerage and IRA went to 130k (started with 10k in brokerage and 17k in IRA btw). Then another correction.

I learned my lesson from last time not to panic so I Diamond handed all summer. Ouch. All the way down to break even all time. We‚Äôre back though and I have an exit strategy this time.

Needless to say the price action the next few weeks is going to ruin some of you and make others of you want to call nana.

How can you make money on options this week? Well, I‚Äôve written you a helpful guide to do so.

Prior to Wednesday market close:
- puts $3-5 OTM 8/30 expiry until NVDA crosses $125 or lower
- $130 calls 8/30 expiry if NVDA falls below $125, then drop calls dollar for dollar (ex: if NVDA hits $122 buy $127 calls).
- swing trade the shit out of this and close out all these mofos prior to earnings.

Wednesday market close:
- stay the F out. This stock will move a bunch AH but it‚Äôll open no more than 3% higher Thursday and IMO will trade 3-5% lower. I think the channel for this is tightening up to really shake some branches in both legs of the options chain.

- let that IV deflate and enter a long call position. What I am uncertain about is how quickly it will recover n rally. I would not be the least bit surprised if you see some downside Thursday Friday.
- I will be watching closely and guess it will fall to below $110 very shortly after earnings. If it opens $125 or higher it may take 3 days for it otherwise I expect the downside to run its course by the weekend.
- calls $5-10 OTM for 9/13 expiration. Of course that‚Äôs LEAPS to yall here so fine go with 9/6 I just don‚Äôt know how long it will do nothing before the do something meme no longer applies.

TL/DR: Market makers will screw both sides of the options chain on earnings. Play puts leading up to ER if NVDA > $125 and calls if it falls below $125. Look for calls after ER timing Thursday might be tight wait until Friday go $5-10 OTM 2 weeks out.

2024-08-27 07:36:10,blackSwanCan,Why NVDA is going to moon for next 2 quarters,"* In the last quarter(s), the big five have raised Capex spending on AI, and their guidance shows even higher Capex spending on AI infra.
* There is a race to capture AI offerings between Google, Microsoft, Amazon, OpenAI, and other upstarts. Neither can give up that race, even if it means more infra spending. For example, Google's stock fell 20% over a small bug in their AI offering. 
* The LLM model sizes are increasing multifold, requiring more/better GPUs, which means more business for NVIDIA. The previous models are mostly useless.
* Assemblers like SMCI have projected a doubling of sales in their recent earning, even with lower margins. 
* Nvidia keeps an insane margin and keeps raising it. Their ability to tell a story around the lower cost to operate, including net energy and compute has been bought by the market. Huangs says it is cheaper to run AI operations with a million-dollar Nvidia chip than a free chip from a competitor. 
* There is still no competition to either Nvidia chips or the Cuda programming and libraries that almost everyone uses for GPU ops. Nvidia has a 10-year lead on GPU programming and open libraries.
* **A reversal of this trend would have telltale signs. None exist.**

Tldr: Nvidia will beat the earnings and raise. The trend will continue for a few more quarters until a recession hits and Big 5 can't spend on infra. We will have bigger problems than Nvidia stock if that happens."
2024-08-27 17:52:35,AwarenessOk5979,Things to consider before betting it all on NVDA earnings tomorrow.,"**TLDR; I AM AS REGARDED as the next guy, but I recommend lowering exposure to NVDA earnings tomorrow to save money to play the aftermath.**

Tomorrow is the Super Bowl of stocks. It's no secret that everyone down to the shoe shiner is balls deep in NVDA (mostly long, looking at the options chain) exposure. There are also those hoping for the end of the world to begin tomorrow. But the one thing we know about Wall Street as a certainty is that they don't like when retail wins.

**We are all aware of the bull case. VERY simplified:**

1. Major tech companies have significantly increased CAPEX in Q2 and it doesn't take a genius to figure out where that money went.

2. Tech CEOs have been quoted as saying that underspending is more of an issue than overspending. *See* *also* Sam Altman (OpenAI) & Co. as being open supporters of the theory of effective accelerationism, which in a nutshell is the belief that the pursuit of general intelligence warrants all costs, natural and financial.

3. Nvidia is still founder led at this scale by Jensen Huang who is an amazing man and one of the greatest minds of our time. 

**The bear case is mostly about forward guidance, as pretty much everyone believes there will be an EPS beat. This is mostly macroeconomic and includes:**

1. Concerns about tech companies not being able to profit from AI spending, leading to winding down.

Rebuttal: We're not going to see this materialize this quarter. Tech has barely dipped their toes into seeing what value they can extract out of the newest line of hardware. It is simply too early to see. Even if you don't buy that, see previous point about under/overspending.

2. Blackwell delays 

Rebuttal: Priced in, much like the heat death of the universe itself. But really, who cares about this. Blackwell is still the only game in town.

3. US economy slowing, 800k jobs just ""lost"" while stocks are nearing ATH, election concerns, general stuff like that.

Rebuttal: No rebuttal. Completely legitimate to believe that a large correction is looming, if you're not kidding yourself. 

**So why not move all in tomorrow? 50/50 is better odds than what retail usually get anyways.**

You all know about IV crush, how NVDA is already priced to jump basically 10% after earnings, and all that. If you need to play options, please consider getting ones longer than August 30, which will be impacted the most. September 20 seems like a fair middle ground between ""fun"" leverage and having enough time to correct the ship should things go bad. 

You also all know that the world is watching these earnings the way we watch a groundhog come out of a hole to tell us if there are going to be six more weeks of winter or early spring. If you are patient enough to hold cash and simply wait to see the outcome, you WILL make money on placing a directionally good bet - with the benefit of being able to scoop up IV crushed options. It is also possible to hold SPY calls/puts as a proxy for NVDA to lessen the impact of IV crush.

It is a likely reality that big money is able to keep the prices pinned this week so that these 130's expire cheap or worthless. A massive 128.60 institutional buy wall was briefly up today, before the stint over 129, which suggests to me that smart money/funds are keeping dry powder ready. 

Please consider which would minimize regret: missing out on winning the big 50/50 or not having the funds to act on what will be very well informed plays for the direction of the entire market over the next 1-2 months.

Thank you very much, may God protect our savings."

There are 136k contracts open on 130 calls for 8/30 expiration. 80k open on 140 calls.

Nothing close on put side (30k at 125 put, 64k at 120 put).

Technology, telecom, and healthcare sectors' share in global stocks reached a record 45% in July 2024.

At the same time, financial, energy, and materials as a % of global equities fell to 25%, below the 2000 levels.

2024-10-19 08:51:08,Opening-Reindeer-112,Puts on NVDA for Monday based on past 3 months data,"So i decided to do some data analysis with ChatGPT on the NVDA stock prices and came across some interesting data. Yesterday's bar for NVDA was an inside bar. For those that are not familiar, an inside bar is when its high is lower than the previous days high and low is higher than the previous days low.

https://preview.redd.it/7hp29qxcgqvd1.png?width=121&format=png&auto=webp&s=164371a63e2b6f36d5e08740d8efc8cf0952ba00

So I decided to find out what happened the last many times this has happened. There have been 12 instances of this since July 2024 and guess what, 6 of them have formed on a Friday. Here is the list of all fridays when this happened -

|| || |9/13/2024| |8/30/2024| |8/23/2024| |7/26/2024| |7/19/2024| |7/12/2024 |

5 of these 6 times the stock tanked the next monday and tuesday. the only time it went higher on monday was on 19th July, but it was down by wednesday and deep in red by Friday.

TLDR: Inside bar analysis from past 3 months shows that NVDA stock price will fall on Monday or by end of next week.

Edit1: Since someone pointed out that NVDA was in a bear trend since july and this was bound to happen. Here is list of all dates on Friday within the last year when we had an inside bar formed:

|| || |9/13/2024| |8/30/2024| |8/23/2024| |7/26/2024| |7/19/2024| |7/12/2024| |4/12/2024| |4/5/2024| |1/12/2024| |11/24/2023| |10/27/2023|

Out of the 12 dates, on 10 occasions the price fell the next monday and tuesday.

  
Edit 2: Got burned yesterday!! But I still believe by end of week prices around 130-135. "

Despite last Tuesday's dip in NVIDIA's stock price after ASML's earnings blowout, and the market's concerns about slowing AI spending remain, NVIDIA's stock price still recorded a 2% gain last week, a cumulative increase of more than 50% over the bottom at the time of the market's collapse in early August.

Wall Street analysts continue to be firmly bullish on NVIDIA ahead of its November earnings report. According to Bloomberg survey statistics, analysts expect NVIDIA shares to rise to $ 148.37 in the next 12 months, including a number of highly bullish analysts on NVIDIA, for example:

On Friday, Bank of America raised its Nvidia price target from $165 to $190. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya, among others, said buying Nvidia is a ‚Äúonce-in-a-generation opportunity.‚Äù
Last week, investment research firm CFRA raised its price target on NVIDIA from $139 to $160.
In the view of Bank of America analysts, the overall AI market demand is growing strongly, in addition to this is also worth noting that NVIDIA's strong performance in the field of enterprise AI, such as partnerships with Microsoft and Accenture and other companies, Bank of America to raise its target price of the other factor, NVIDIA is the preferred partner for enterprise AI hardware and software.

Wedbush analyst and NVIDIA majority owner Dan Ives expressed a similar sentiment in a report sent to investors on Sunday. He claimed that enterprise spending is growing in giant waves as AI adoption scenarios explode, and NVIDIA is leading the way.

Ives predicts that the AI infrastructure market will grow tenfold between now and 2027, with companies investing $1 trillion in AI capital expenditures during that time. ‚ÄúIn short, we think tech stocks are poised for another 20% rally in 2025, and this tech bull market driven by the AI revolution is just entering its next phase. We believe that the Fed and Powell have initiated an aggressive rate-cutting cycle, that a soft macroeconomic landing is still the way forward, and that tech spending on AI is a crossover spending wave that is just getting off the ground in the tech sector.‚Äù"

2024-11-02 08:17:45,Kazgarth_,Why I think TSM/INTC will outpace NVDA/AMD growth in the next decade. ,"Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are spending billions of CapEx on AI. Lets just look at their last 2 quarters spending:

* **Amazon**: Increased CapEx from $60 billion in Q2 2024 to $70 billion in Q3 2024.
* **Google**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion in the same period.
* **Microsoft**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion.
* **Meta**: Increased CapEx from $29 billion to $31 billion.

However not all that CapEx is going to third party AI solutions like Nvidia/AMD. Each and every company listed above has or is developing it's own custom AI silicon.

Lets look how they are transitioning from 3rd party to In-House AI silicon:

**Amazon**: Developed AWS Inferentia and Tranium chips for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Google**: Developed Tensor Processing Unite (TPU) and Axion chip for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

**Microsoft**: Developed Azure Maia AI chip and Azure Cobalt for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Meta**: Developed Meta trading and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

All those developments reduce dependence on external GPU suppliers, allow more customized/efficient AI processing and most importantly huge cost savings.

Just to understand the level of savings (and why would they invest huge R&D budget on this):

A **regular Nvidia H100 GPU**, cost approximately **$3,320** to manufacture from TSMC. However it is being sold at **$25,000 to $30,000** each!

That's almost 800%-900% profit margins that has to be paid by the companies above, when they opt not to choose In-House Silicon.

As more of the AI CapEx goes to custom silicon (will never be 100%, but expect that percentage only to grow larger over time, driven by cost savings)  TSMC and Intel foundries will benefit directly from this trend (both have EUV capabilities, INTC will mass produce 18A EUV chips next year, with Amazon as first client)

And this will position TSMC and INTC for substantial growth, because **the rate limiting factor for AI growth will be how much silicon can TSMC or INTC manufacture** for the entire world's AI demand.

It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four... NVDA continues to climb on growth, steady healthy growth, not insane nuclear growth. THAT WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. It has no where else to go. Ive's and Wedbush, are ENTIRELY correct.

Lastly NVDA will own the entire vertical from Hyperscaler to Retail Individual end user level, why? NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?..

 I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about. And as far as I know, Biden or Trump won't block sales of regular computer pc windows chips to China or anywhere else for that matter. :)

Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda). People will hunt down a windows PC that has both* NVDA* gpu AND CPU* chips. Here is the link for more info=

""Not just that, but NVIDIA is also cooking up its new GeForce RTX 50 series ""Blackwell"" desktop graphics cards, and its new GeForce RTX 50 Laptop series ""Blackwell"" mobile GPUs, which will end up being featured inside of these new AI PCs with an NVIDIA + MediaTek CPU based on the Arm architecture.""

""NVIDIA has also previously said that RTX is the ""Premium"" AI PC platform, and that CPUs and SoCs launching with new NPUs (Neural Processing Units for AI workloads) are for ""Basic"" AI PCs.

""The new silicon will support advanced technologies, and will be mass-produced on TSMC's new 3nm process node, and will compete against Apple's new M4 chip, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X processors.""

""However, you'd think it would lean heavily on Nvidia's graphics technology. Ultimately, you'd expect it to offer the best graphics performance on the market."" DAMN STRAIGHT. 

""The implication** with this new PC chip for 2025 is that it may well (It WILL, no 'may' it will) debut a new* in-house CPU core design from Nvidia. It would certainly be far more interesting if it did. (it will)That would also enable Nvidia to offer something much more performant than Arm's own CPU core designs.""
aaand = 

""And make no mistake, the Arm instruction set allows for some very high performance CPU cores these days. By some measures, Apple's latest CPU cores in the M4 have 60% better IPC (or performance per clock cycle) than anything Intel or AMD currently offer.""

And these cpu chips to come out officially in September 2025, but anouncement dates and getting market ready will start first half of 2025, likely this ER starts talking about it or beginning of next year... Commercial anouncement will be THE FIRST HALF OF 2025 or first qtr of 2025 yr proper... but you never know, Jensen might pull an early bird push this into the EARLY first half of 2025... Very likely Jensen talks about these babies in this coming CC next Friday?, we'll see. But it's happening either way. And market will value and trade NVDA accordingly. Millions of PC's with NVDA CPU's, as far as I can remember Biden cant block normal PC chips for normal computers to China or anywhere else for that matter.

I'm not your mom. Just an OP. Read and discuss and be nice to each other. And remember to hedge like a good little boy and girl."
2024-11-07 16:31:01,mayer_of_gainsville,YOLO $35k into 1.1MM to save the family farm. ,"Fellow regards, longtime lurker breaking the silence to YOLO $32K to save the family farm.

Grandaddy died in April this year leaving a 3 generation farm, (fully paid, no debt) to my parents. Mom never worked and my dad‚Äôs income has never been much (minister at small church). Unsurprisingly, mom and dad want to cash in on that sweet sweet inheritance $$$ by selling the farm and upgrading their lifestyle with the proceeds.

I would give my right kidney to keep that farm if I knew how to sell it. It‚Äôs where I grew up, convinced my girlfriend (now wife) to marry me, and want our two small children to make their own memories there. 

I‚Äôve traded positions in $NVDA, $ASTS, $RKLB and $RDDT (thanks to this community) hoping to somehow make enough to buy the farm but have only managed roughly to double my money ($15K to $32K). I completely realize it‚Äôs an idiot move but it‚Äôs the only chance I have at this point and I‚Äôm 100% willing to go to $0 if there is a chance I can make it to $1.1MM. 

The farm is going to be listed next week and I want to go full regard with my portfolio to buy it. If I sell my house I still need $1.1MM to make up the difference and I‚Äôm willing to bet everything I have in the market for the chance to make it happen. 

Would happily go all-in on anything that might print before February since the farm will probably be sold around that time. 

Before anyone asks, there is no other way. My folks want the $$$ now and won‚Äôt sell the farm for any less than market value to me or anyone else. Renting the tillable acres to a local farmer would only cover 1.5 months of the mortgage payment. Maybe the best offer is $800K, maybe the real estate market crashes tomorrow, but bottom line is I have to close the gap between $35K and $1.1MM to have any shot at keeping it. 

TLDR: regard wants to yolo his 100% gains on a moonshot to save his sentimentality important childhood home knowing full well he should blow it on strippers stead because it would be more fun. 

Thanks in advance! "
2024-11-12 10:27:52,constructiontimeagnn,My views on why NVDA beats earnings and flies to higher supports. Likley past 200. ,"For the PE bitchers and moaners, I leave you this:

AMD Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 126  

NVDA Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 69 


Chanos bitched and moaned all the way to the broke house where he had to close shop. Tesla preaching and evangelizing the PE did him an apostate. He's done. TESLA CRUSHED HIM. Tesla easily slid into it's PE and Chanos is no more. Same thing happened with the bitchers and moaners with Amazon, Google, etc. When a company is a quality company and especially part of the SP500, where every iteration of that index HAS TO PURCHASE this stock, you ride well, and the company easily slides well into it's PE very well and snuggly like. 

Just like Zuckerberg sucker punched Open AI LLM's by making it's LLM open source and scorching the Earth, So goes NVDA: Open sourcing their DATA CENTER TECH, ( a little secret, its not just about the GPU, it's the entire package, it's not just about BLACKWELL GPU. But Rack/ Data Center Tech Design and Architecture, there will BE ZERO INCENTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS TO GO TO COMPETITORS WHEN RACK ARCHITECTURE THAT FITS BLACKWELL GPU's with ZERO ISSUE, IS COMPLETELY OUT IN THE OPEN: READ SUMMARY( this is why AMD and INTEL are having such a hard time competing and frankly anybody else, unless you're DELL and WORKING with Jensen... But Dell doesn't make chips, so their good bros and compliment each other very well in many ways, STILL NVDA HAS IT'S OWN DATA CENTER RACK TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOT DELL'S AND IT IS NOW OPEN SOURCE- FROM COOLING TO ETHERNET AND SCALING DATA TECHNOLOGY... GIVING THEM A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE.. vs those that want to take away their Data Center Service / Business :

This OCP summit with this open sourcing debut specifically for Blackwell tech was as of last month, Oct 17th.

( Jensen is busy busy busy )  
""At this year‚Äôs OCP Global Summit, NVIDIA will be sharing key portions of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system‚Äôs electro-mechanical design with the OCP community ‚Äî including the rack architecture, compute and switch tray mechanicals, liquid-cooling and thermal environment specifications, and NVIDIA NVLink‚Ñ¢ cable cartridge volumetrics‚Äîto support higher compute density and networking bandwidth.""  
..""said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. ‚ÄúBy advancing open standards, we‚Äôre helping organizations worldwide take advantage of the full potential of accelerated computing and create the AI factories of the future.‚Äù

Everybody KNOWS there is a plateau. A plateau and lower business revenues based on estimates that TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT INFERENCE IS LESS DEMANDING THAN TRAINING.
