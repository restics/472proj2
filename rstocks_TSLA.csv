2023-11-16 03:38:24,DerpJungler,"""Magnificent 7"" vs S&P 500?","I really don't like the *""Magnificent 7""* name at all, but since everyone has adopted it, let's just roll with it. For those who don't know the Magnificent 7 are: **AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, NVDA.** With a combined market cap of **more than $11 trillion**, they currently make up approx. **29% of the S&P 500's market cap.** 

The 7 giants have gained **71%** so far this year while the rest of the 493 stocks included in the benchmark index have gained 6%. They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets. 

Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least. 

Now I know this is a ""stocks"" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&P 500 ETF.

So I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META & TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.

Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future. Nowdays it's as difficult as ever to overtake these giants, imo."
2023-11-20 03:53:46,Jones131212,Tesla's earnings should improve in Q4; short TSLA puts now for income.,"In Q3, Tesla reported modest results with a 5% YoY increase in automotive revenue and a 9% YoY increase in total revenue, attributed to price decreases, lower sales volume, and production. Despite this, the company generated positive free cash flow (FCF) of $0.8 billion, with a 3.4% FCF margin.  
  
Analysts are more optimistic about Q4, forecasting a 10.6% potential gain in adjusted non-GAAP EPS to 73 cents and a 9.5% increase in total revenue to $25.7 billion. However, Tesla's stock (TSLA) has seen a decline, down 8.1% in the last month and 20.1% from its peak in July, possibly reflecting pessimism.  
  
Option premiums are high due to this pessimism, providing an opportunity for investors to sell short near-term out-of-the-money (OTM) puts as an income play. For instance, by selling the $220 strike price expiring on Dec. 8 for $4.35, investors can achieve an immediate 1.98% yield for three weeks.  
  
Investors must secure $22,000 in cash or margin to sell 1 put contract, potentially making $7,395 annually if the trade is repeated every three weeks. However, this strategy carries risks, as TSLA could drop below the breakeven level, requiring the investor to purchase 100 shares at the strike price.  
  
To manage downside risk, investors can buy puts at a lower OTM strike price, such as the $210 puts, reducing potential losses. Alternatively, a very conservative approach involves shorting the $210 puts for immediate income and a lower breakeven level.  
  
Investors should carefully monitor market conditions and adjust their strategy accordingly, potentially selling $210 puts for income once it appears unlikely that TSLA will fall near that price within the next three weeks.

He was asked a question about diversification and in classic Buffett fashion, he rejected the whole ideology behind diversification and university finance courses teaching the prudent principle of diversification. Personally I agree with him, and he has stuck to this principle for a long time. Berkshire has a 50% allocation to apple right now. He said you should never need more than 3 businesses to make you extremely wealthy and get you through all economic conditions.

2023-12-20 00:28:01,Sexyvette07,"What's your largest individual stock holding? (No shilling, please).","Howdy everybody. Lately, I've been investing more in individual stocks that are undervalued, as opposed to putting it in ETF's that are at ATH. Thus far, my strategy has outperformed the overall market by quite a bit. I'm up 20% since starting this strategy about 6 months ago, versus the overall market being up by about 10% in the same time period. Yes, I understand there's inherently more risk with individual stocks. Also, FWIW, I'm not bragging, just giving some depth to the conversation and my reasoning for asking these questions. Anyway, moving on. I'm looking to expand that number of individual stock holdings, but also diversity into new holdings as opposed to taking bigger positions on what I already own. Im looking for crowd favorites for individual stock holdings. So my question to you all is this: For those who don't have *all* of their money in ETF's, what is the single stock you hold the most of? How much of that holding represents your overall portfolio? Are these long-term holdings, or have you purchased shares lately? Why is that particular stock your largest individual holding?


I'll leave mine out for the time being because I don't want this to come across as a shilling post or for it to devolve into an argument. I genuinely want to know what you guys are holding. So, how about it, people? What are you holding?"

2023-12-28 22:19:50,Sexyvette07,Help me understand how Tesla isn't **insanely** overpriced.,"Hey everyone. I'm trying to wrap my head around why Tesla's stock is so insanely high with the outlook looking not so great. People keep buying it and I can't understand why, other than people are buying it for a long term AI holding. If thats the case, isn't there FAR better stocks to buy?

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/price-earnings-peg-ratios

Even looking at 2025, the stock still looks very overpriced at a forward PE of 55.4. PEG ratio is 5.11, lol. I don't know that I've seen a PEG ratio that high before.

There's also some headwinds for Tesla. They recently lost the federal tax credit on most of their lineup. This will undoubtedly affect sales and their margins, but admittedly they should remain profitable without the tax credits. IIRC one of the articles I read said that, without the credits, their margin is around 30%, which is still higher than most auto manufacturers. But still, for this company being valued higher than any other auto manufacturer in the world, even ones that sell exponentially more vehicles, I still don't see how the stock price equals reality. 

https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2023/10/30/5-reasons-why-electric-vehicle-sales-have-slowed/

There has been a slowdown already in electric vehicle sales that will most likely be accelerated by losing the tax credits. Granted that's not all Tesla's fault. We are still a few years away from viable Li-Ion alternatives being ready for mass adoption. Until that happens, the cost of the batteries and rare minerals to make them will remain the biggest hurdle they face. Not to mention hydrogen powered hybrids are slated for mass production starting next year. Electricity rates are constantly increasing. Even if you have a bunch of solar panels, you still paid for that electricity, even if it's cheaper than what you're getting from your utility company. Whereas water is the most abundant resource on the planet. The advantage here does not go for pure electric vehicles IMO.

As far as the AI angle, are they really a competitor when they still only have level 2 autonomous driving? Seems to me like Google would be an infinitely better stock for the AI angle since they are expanding to level 3 and 4 autonomous driving, no? Even if they don't plan on making vehicles, Google seems like the no brainer here and it has very realistic valuations. If im wrong here, please explain why. This post isn't to shit on Tesla stock. I genuinely want to know **if** I'm wrong and why. Thanks everyone!"

This made me think it would be interesting to create some sort of Hate Index where we list the top most-hated stocks on Reddit (or on the internet in general), and then measure it against the S&P500 after a year or two. Or maybe it's been done already? Either way, it wouldn't shock me if the Hate Index turned out to outperform the market in the end.

What do you think are some of the most hated stocks at the moment (meaning the ones that generate the largest amount of negative comments, even if they also have a large number of vocal supporters), and is there some sort of sentiment metric we could use to quantify the hate?

Revenue: $40.1 billion. That may not compare with the $39.18 billion expected by LSEG


Wall Street will also be looking at these key user numbers:

Daily active users (DAUs): 2.11 billion vs. 2.08 billion expected, according to StreetAccount

Monthly active users (MAUs): 3.07 billion vs. 3.06 billion expected, according to StreetAccount


Meta is projected to report revenue growth of 22% as the online advertising market continues to recover from a brutal 2022, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates forced brands to reel in spending.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributes advances in artificial intelligence to improvements in the ad business, which is growing faster than rival Google. In Alphabet’s earnings report on Tuesday, the company said Google ad revenue increased 11% from a year earlier, slower expansion than analysts were expecting.

Part of Meta’s financial recovery over the past year was driven by Chinese retailers, which have bolstered spending to reach users across the globe. Meta finance chief Susan Li most recently highlighted the significance of business from China in the company’s third-quarter earnings report in October. Li didn’t name specific companies, but fast-growing upstarts Temu and Shein, which originated in China, have been pouring money into ads on Facebook and Instagram.

While Meta has a very diverse base of advertisers, some analysts say the potential for Temu and Shein to pull back spending poses a risk because every point of growth matters for a company that saw revenue shrink for three straight quarters in 2022.

Zuckerberg, along with the top executives at TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Snap and Discord, faced tough questioning from lawmakers on Wednesday. They accused the Facebook founder of ignoring the severity of child exploitation on the company’s family of apps.

Parents attending the hearing lambasted Meta and other companies for what they allege are insufficient safety and design measures that have caused mental health issues for their children and, in some cases, even resulted in their deaths.

“I’m sorry for everything you’ve all gone through. It’s terrible,” Zuckerberg told the parents in an emotional scene on Capitol Hill. “No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.” 

Investors will also be looking for signs that Meta’s pivot to the metaverse is bearing fruit. The company has been burning billions of dollars a quarter to build out a virtual world that Zuckerberg has said is the future of computing. In total, the division has lost about $25 billion since the beginning of 2022, shortly after Zuckerberg renamed his company.

Analysts expect Reality Labs to show revenue of $762.8 million for the quarter and an operating loss of $4.26 billion, according to StreetAccount.

Still, now, I don't know whether to just sell the above stocks at a loss and go into the ETFs or if that's just me being rash. Each of them are strong companies, for example BABA is underpriced although I know that's because of politics in China, and even the 'overpriced' ones have their arguments of possibly going up more than the ETFs in the future for various reasons (GTA VI is going to be absolutely huge for TTWO, I don't think it's fully priced in yet, and TSLA speculation) but also I don't want to just lose a bunch of money again. At this point is it worth just holding onto them for the possible upswing? What are people's feelings/sentiments on these stocks at the minute?"
2024-03-13 11:47:04,DirtySlutCunt,"If you were down 5 figures on a stock but you'd buy it at its current price, would you double down? [TSLA]","Due to the nature of my work I cannot sell uncovered options. I need 100 shares. I currently own 45 with an average buy price of $370.

It's currently at $170. If I didn't own the stock, I would buy it now.

Is it worth buying because it's cheap? I would buy another 55, just so I can sell 1 option contract OTM, 1 month out for a measly 30-100 bucks or so.

Due to the nature of my job, I can only do 30 days or longer selling covered calls, so the best strategy woukd be to let them expire. I also am not allowed to buy options less than 1 year out.

My overall portfolio is still up, but this one weighs heavy on me. Lol.

Edit: for those asking about the restrictions, I work at a BD and cannot speculate (thus no naked calls) or day trade or do anything that would appear that I am manipulating the market.

2024-03-14 05:56:52,Hanzoisbad,Tesla (TSLA) DCF Analysis,"***NOTE: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***

# Introduction:

TSLA is the world's most renowned Electric Vehicle(EV) automaker, catalyzing the world's acceleration towards Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles. TSLA has become the gold standard for what a high-quality EV stands for, all thanks in part to their founder's vision and belief in renewable energy especially during the tumultuous early years of TSLA. TSLA no longer just stands for EV but renewable energy, having branched out into Energy Storage, and Solar Panels.  TSLA hopes to create an ecosystem for renewable energy from charging to energy storage to the vehicle used, all this tied together by dedicated software created by TSLA at every point of contact in the ecosystem. This ecosystem business model has seen massive success as evident from businesses like GOOG, AAPL, and MSFT. I believe the next frontier of growth for TSLA comes from energy storage rather than automotive, however automotive will still account for the largest chunk of revenue for TSLA.

# Market:

TSLA's closest EV competitor is BYD. TSLA has won BYD on almost every front. A country where BYD has managed to wrest control from TSLA is Thailand. So I'll analyze this market specifically to rationalize why I believe this victory will be shortlived.

In Thailand, the top 3 most popular car models are BYD Atto 3, Netta V, and BYD Dolphin ([SOURCE](https://carnewschina.com/2024/01/09/byd-is-bestselling-ev-brand-in-thailand-in-2023-neta-is-runner-up/)).   

|Model|Price|Range|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BYD Atto 3|1.1M Baht|521 km/charge|
|Neta V|0.55M Baht|380 km/charge|
|BYD Dolphin|0.75M Baht|427 km/charge|
|Tesla Model 3|1.59M Baht|513 km/charge|

In Thailand, 60.17% of the population owns a car ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1027960/thailand-car-ownership-among-consumers/)) with the average car price being about 0.78M Baht. This means that a Tesla Model 3, TSLA's cheapest model is double the average price of a normal car in Thailand. 

[SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1030220/thailand-average-monthly-income-per-household-by-region/)) which means that the Tesla Model 3 is a luxury good rather than an affordable commodity for the average household. The difference in price between BYD and Tesla is a full year's worth of income for the average household which leads the price-conscious consumers in Thailand to naturally gravitate towards BYD, hence the popularity of BYD over Tesla in Thailand.   
  
Ultimately, I do believe that if TSLA continues competing on quality and finds ways to cut costs such as directly setting up factories in Thailand ([SOURCE](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/05/business/thailand-tesla-factory-talks-intl-hnk/index.html)), it will be able to close the price gap with BYD. As ""people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla. It’s quite a difficult thing for them to do, and remarkable that it’s the best-selling car in unit volume, despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference

# Revenue:

TSLA has 5 revenue channels, namely “Automotive Sales”, “Services and Others”, “Automotive Lease”, “Automotive Regulatory Credit” and “Energy Generation and Storage sales”. 

***Automotive Sales***

Automotive sales refers to the direct sale of TSLA’s vehicles fully paid upfront.

Elon Musk believes that manufacturing capabilities will be the most important C.A. for TSLA. “perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology” -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. 

When forecasting the Number of Vehicles each Gigafactory can produce, I took into account that Elon Musk recently unveiled in the 2023 Q4 Earnings conference that there is a new revolutionary manufacturing technology that is expected to drastically improve production. He hopes to pilot test this technology at the Texas Gigafactory to produce their low-cost EV before proceeding to replicate the technology in every Gigafactory. “the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.” -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. So, in my first 3 years, I assume that the growth rate is below historical averages as TSLA tests out new technology in preparation for the launch of the low-cost EV. I assumed that TSLA’s manufacturing technology was successful.  
  
When forecasting %Vehicles delivered, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historical averages  
  
When forecasting Avg Price/Vehicles Delivered, Elon Musk doesn’t believe in price increases to increase the topline. As evident in 2021 and 2022 where Elon Musk only increased prices due to supply chain constraints before bringing prices back down in 2023. In China, Elon Musk ended up cutting prices due to being able to source significantly cheaper batteries there. I assumed that over time as TSLA enjoys sufficient economies of scale, they will only increase prices in line with perpetual inflation.  


***Services and Others***

TSLA provides a few services such as home servicing in certain regions or customers pay to access TSLA’s network of SuperChargers.  
  
Lifetime number of TSLA automobile (Ex roadster) delivered ([SOURCE](https://backlinko.com/tesla-stats))

Assuming that TSLA is properly maintained they can last \~20 years ([SOURCE](https://caredge.com/blog/how-long-tesla-batteries-last)). Opting for less granularity, in my forecast I assumed the total lifetime number of tesla cars remained constant without any churn.

When forecasting Services and Others, Opting for less granularity I assumed that the servicing’s pricing grew following the price of the vehicle in line with historic averages. 

  
***Automotive Lease***

TSLA has 2 types of lease, “Direct Vehicle Operations Lease” which leases out vehicles to customers for up to 48 months afterwards the vehicle is returned to TSLA. “Direct Sales Lease” either granting the customer title of the vehicle once full payment has been made or the customer has the option of refusing the vehicle.  
  
When forecasting Automotive leasing, as prices for TSLA fell in 2023, Automotive leasing as a percentage of Automotive Sales dropped as it is now cheaper for customers to purchase their tesla in 1 lump sum payment. I assumed that following this trend, as TSLA’s affordability increases over time the %Automotive Sales decreases as well before remaining constant in perpetuity.

  
***Automotive Regulatory Credit***

TSLA has excess carbon credit which it sells to competitors.

“It will continue for some period of time, but eventually this stream of regulatory credits will reduce.” ([SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-9-billion-revenue-selling-regulatory-credits-to-other-carmakers-2024-2)).  


When forecasting Automotive Regulatory Credit, given that TSLA does not intend to depend on these credits for revenue, I assume that as a %of Automotive sales, credit will contribute to a significantly lesser amount in perpetuity. This is further exacerbated by other automobile companies accelerating their push towards EVs as countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles. So, more companies begin having excess regulatory credits as well. Ultimately, I believe that leading up to 2030 the amount of revenue contributed by Regulatory credits decreases to a significant level. 

  
***Energy Generation and Storage Sales***

TSLA produces Energy Storage systems e.g. Megapack and Solar Energy related products e.g. Solar Panels which it directly sells to customers.  
  
For energy storage more specifically megapacks, as the world phases out ICE vehicles and begins embracing renewable energy, it leads to a surge in demand for electricity. However, the issue with renewable energy is that “The most common renewable energy sources like the sun and wind are intermittent or have lower baseload capabilities than coal, natural gas, or nuclear sources. This makes it necessary to have a way to conserve excess energy produced during peak hours. This extra energy can then be supplied through the grid or otherwise when the sun is down, or wind speed reduces.” ([SOURCE](https://www.batterycycle.io/why-is-tesla-focusing-on-the-battery-energy-storage-market/)). As an example to elaborate on how much importance is placed on energy storage, China mandates that all renewable energy facilities must store at least 20% of their total output ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiYquPrkuaEAxXuSGwGHffzBkgQFnoECA0QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Ferikkobayashisolomon%2F2023%2F12%2F20%2Fenergy-vault-wins-big-with-gravity-storage-in-china%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DChina%2520has%2520mandated%2520that%2520all%2Cgeneration%2520capacity%27s%2520worth%2520of%2520storage.&usg=AOvVaw3WMq0w9-2ka0Cz2kAGbCWX&opi=89978449)).  
  
The closest competitor to TSLA in energy pack is BYD. The TSLA’s megapack is smaller in dimensions compared to BYD and on top of that TSLA has built its own software to be compatible with the megapack hardware with features such as Autobidder (Software to optimize energy trading) and Powerhub.  
  
Right now what's stopping revenue for energy storage is production capacity, TSLA opened its megapack factory in Lathrop to curb this. TSLA has also announced its plans to build a megapack factory in China to assist with production capacity ([SOURCE](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-22/tesla-acquires-land-for-shanghai-megapack-battery-factory)). As an overarching goal for my forecast, I took into account the TSLA master plan 3.  
  
When forecasting number of dedicated megapack factories opened, I assumed that TSLA would open 1 additional plant every 3 years for the next 10 years, to meet the large surge in demand as countries accelerate their push towards renewable energy.  
  
When forecasting Max Output/Factory, taking into account this article on expected output. ([SOURCE](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2023/11/tesla-megapack-factory-production-limit-solved-and-capacity-will-be-doubled-to-80-gwh.html)). TSLA’s Lathrop Megapack factory can produce 80GWh/Year in part due to them doubling their existing lines and resolving certain issues. Over time I believe that TSLA can massively increase the Max Output/Factory, as TSLA consistently touts their innovations as having an S curve of progression, where progress is slower at the earlier stages before exponentially increasing.   
As a sanity check, in my base case assuming that all Mega packs are still at 4 MWh. TSLA has to produce 406,200 Mega Packs or 81,240 Mega Pack per factory a year by 2038. As of November 2023, the Lathrop factory can produce 20,000 megapack. So, in 15 years I believe it is a reasonable amount of time necessary for TSLA to ramp up their production 4x.  
  
When forecasting %GWh Deployed, I had to assume total output which is a function of max output and the number of gigafatories. I assumed that over the years as more countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles in favor of EVs, there is a larger need to deploy more energy storage so this % increases to a large extent.  
  
When forecasting Avg Sales/GWh Deployed, Elon Musk does not like to increase sales through increasing pricing which was why when TSLA enjoyed economies of scale from increasing output in their Lathrop factory the Avg Sales/GWh Deployed decreased. So, applying this principle of TSLA slashing prices when costs decrease due to economies of scale, I assumed that TSLA continued slashing prices before increasing by the perpetual inflation rate.

# Cost:

“predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. 

  
When forecasting Automotive and Non-Automtoive COGS, COGS as a %revenue for 2021 and 2022 are likely to be lower due to TSLA pre-emptively increasing sales price to deal with inflation. However, in 2023 COGS as a %revenue increased as TSLA cut back on sales price. Going forward, I’ll assume that TSLA tends towards historic pre-covid average. However, in the long run, as TSLA successfully implements their manufacturing technology this % will decrease even further.  
When forecasting R&D, SG&A, and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

# WACC:

US 10Y T-Bond (1M Avg) = 4.12%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/)) = 2.41

Currently, TSLA has a very large beta as its stock has increased in volatility in the past few years. However, I believe that this volatility will not persist for very long as most big tech stocks enter a stable stage where their beta tends downwards. So, as a proxy for how low TSLA’s beta will tend to, I looked at other big tech stocks.



|Name|Beta|
|:-|:-|
|Google (GOOG)|1.04|
|Microsoft (MSFT)|0.89|
|Meta (META)|1.21|

Taking the average beta, we arrive at a beta of 1.05. Assuming similar D/E composition and bond rating. I assumed that it took another 10 years for TSLA to reach the stable state.  
  
Stable State COE = 8.95%  
Stable State AT-COD = 4.52%  
TSLA’s stable stage WACC = 8.90%  


# Conclusion:

Ultimately in my base case, I value TSLA at $186.88 per share. I believe that there is still room for TSLA to grow, having such a strong first movers advantage in the renewable energy market means that TSLA is heads and shoulders above its competitors. I believe that the market is undervaluing the Energy Storage arm of TSLA's business, and less emphasis is placed on this potentially disruptive segment of business.

And then there are the bear cases floating around out there like regional bank failures, Michael Burry's bear case, corporate real estate almost in crisis and in crisis in certain areas.

But, if it were that close I think it would’ve happened already.

My bet is if it’s solvable it may be decades away.

Even if it seems close.

Sometimes what seems close is actually far away and the last gap is not easy to overcome.

Look at VR! The virtual boy was in the 90s and we just now have real VR. And it’s still not perfect.

The problem is unlike big tech Tesla doesn’t print money that they can throw at a moon shot forever.

I think Tesla returning to facebook even when Elon owns its rival is a huge red flag. Remember he swore it off before even buying Twitter and the dude is notorious for being one of the most stubborn people on the planet.

Not to mention, it reeks of desperation that he is claiming he wants to resort to the same tactics used by sellers of time shares to sell FSD… basically forcing people through a demo before they get their car.

Total deliveries Q1 2024: 386,810
Total production Q1 2024: 433,371

Tesla doesn’t break out sales of its vehicles by model but reported that it produced 412,376 Model 3/Y cars and delivered 369,783 of those cars. It produced 20,995 of its other models and delivered 17,027.

In the same period last year, the electric automaker reported 422,875 deliveries and production of 440,808 vehicles. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries and production of 494,989 vehicles.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications.

According to a mean of 11 estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts were expecting deliveries of around 457,000 for the period ending March 31. Estimates ranged from a high of 511,000 deliveries to a low of 414,000 for the first quarter, with estimates updated in March ranging from 414,000 to 469,000 deliveries.

Independent auto industry researcher Troy Teslike, whose work is closely followed by Tesla fans, had expected deliveries to come in around 409,000.

Tesla’s head of investor relations Martin Viecha sent around a company-compiled consensus based on 30 analysts’ estimates over the weekend to select investors. The consensus, which was viewed by CNBC, said analysts were expecting a mean of 443,027 deliveries and a median of 431,125 deliveries for the quarter.

Tesla faced numerous challenges in the first quarter.

Houthi militia attacks on shippers in the Red Sea disrupted Tesla’s component supply and temporarily suspended production at its German factory outside of Berlin in January. In March, environmental activists set fire to infrastructure near that same factory, depriving Tesla of sufficient operation power and again causing a pause in production.

In China, Tesla faced an onslaught of competition from domestic EV makers, including BYD and newcomers such as the phone maker Xiaomi. After sluggish sales numbers for its China-made cars in January and February, Tesla reduced production of its Model 3 and Model Y at its Shanghai plant and slashed workers’ schedules to 5 days a week from 6 and a half days.

In the U.S., reviews were mixed for Tesla’s newest model — an angular pickup dubbed the Cybertruck — which the EV maker only began to sell in small numbers in December last year.

A series of discounts and incentives appeared to be less effective in driving sales volume than in the past for Tesla.

During the final days of the first quarter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo the newest version of the company’s premium driver assistance system for customers in North America before handing over their cars. The system is marketed as Full Self-Driving but doesn’t make Tesla cars autonomous. They require a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

Shares of Tesla dropped 29% in the first quarter, the biggest decline since the end of 2022 and the third-steepest quarterly plunge since the company’s IPO in 2010.

2024-04-03 19:33:03,TimeTravelingChris,"Tesla (TSLA) PT Lowered to $115 at JPMorgan, 'We are slashing our estimates and price target'","
On Wednesday, JPMorgan revised its price target for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares, reducing it to $115 from the previous $130 while maintaining an Underweight rating. The adjustment follows Tesla's first-quarter delivery numbers, which significantly fell short of both JPMorgan's and consensus expectations.

Analysts at JPMorgan expressed concern that the disappointing delivery figures might impact investor confidence in Tesla's long-term growth prospects, which is vital for upholding the stock's high valuation multiple.

Tesla's vehicle sales for the first quarter of 2024 showed a year-over-year decline of 9%, contrasting with the Bloomberg consensus estimate which anticipated a growth of 6%, and the company-compiled consensus which expected a 5% increase. This miss represents the largest discrepancy from analyst estimates on record for the electric vehicle maker.

Previously, analysts projected that Tesla would sell 626,000 vehicles in the first quarter, marking a 48% year-over-year growth, but the actual sales reported were only 387,000 vehicles, which is 38% below the peak forecast from June 10, 2022.

In light of these results, JPMorgan has also reduced its estimates for Tesla's first-quarter revenue, now expecting $21.4 billion compared to the previous $25.6 billion, and below the consensus forecast of $23.5 billion. The firm's forecast for earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter has been lowered to $0.42 from the prior estimate of $0.69, which is also beneath the consensus of $0.61.

The revised EPS forecast is a steep drop from the peak consensus of $1.94 before Tesla implemented a strategy of heavy discounting to boost unit volume in response to softening demand.

Moreover, JPMorgan now anticipates a significant free cash outflow of $1.3 billion for the first quarter, a reversal from its earlier expectation of a $300 million inflow, and contrary to the consensus for a $1 billion inflow. This expectation is based on the assumption of a record increase in finished goods inventory, as Tesla produced 47,000 more vehicles than it sold in the quarter.

This inventory buildup, according to JPMorgan, suggests that the lower deliveries were due to demand constraints rather than supply issues, refuting any implications that disruptions such as the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea or the fire incident at Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory were the primary causes.

JPMorgan warns that Tesla shares, which already saw a 4.9% decline on Tuesday compared to the S&P 500's 0.7% drop, could face further decreases if the company fails to quickly revive unit volume and revenue growth. The firm cautions that investors might reconsider the premium valuation multiple currently assigned to Tesla's stock in the absence of sustained growth.

2024-04-17 04:28:13,LordSpitzi,Tesla asks shareholders to approve CEO Musk's 2018 pay voided by judge,"April 17 (Reuters) - Electric automaker Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab on Wednesday asked shareholders to ratify billionaire Elon Musk's compensation that was set in 2018 under the CEO pay package, just months after a Delaware judge rejected it.
The judge had tossed out Musk's record-breaking $56 billion pay in January, calling the compensation granted by the board ""an unfathomable sum"" that was unfair to shareholders.

Tesla has some old inventory at their Orland Park IL service center, some dating back to January. No wonder why Tesla is announcing layoffs.

2024-04-19 04:07:59,LordSpitzi,"Tesla to recall 3,878 Cybertrucks over faulty accelerator pedal, NHTSA says","April 19 (Reuters) - Tesla [(TSLA.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O) is recalling 3,878 Cybertrucks to fix an accelerator pedal pad that could come loose and get lodged in the interior trim, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Friday.

A trapped accelerator pedal could cause the vehicle to accelerate unintentionally, increasing the risk of a crash, the auto safety regulator said in a [notice, opens new tab](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCAK-24V276-5059.pdf).

Tesla started deliveries of its Cybertruck electric pickup truck late last year, after a two-year delay due to production problems and battery-supply constraints.

The EV maker will replace or repair the accelerator pedal assembly at no charge and owners will be notified through letters mailed to them in June, the NHTSA said.

In the first quarter of 2024 Tesla had three recalls affecting about 2.4 million vehicles, according to a report by recall management firm BizzyCar.

However, most issues related to Tesla recalls are usually resolved through over-the-air software updates.

In February, Tesla [recalled](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recall-over-2-mln-vehicles-us-nhtsa-2024-02-02/) about 2.2 million vehicles in the United States due to an incorrect font size on warning lights and U.S. safety regulators [upgraded their probe](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recall-over-2-mln-vehicles-us-nhtsa-2024-02-02/) into the company's vehicles over power steering loss to the status of an engineering analysis.

2024-04-24 09:58:45,EuclidianEigenvalue,INTC vs TSLA - Trying to understand market sentiment.,"Forgive my naive question but I'm really trying to wrap my head around these two stocks (stockholder in both).  
  
INTC - Semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse. Still has a majority in data center and pc CPU space. I do agree that they fell behind TSMC and Samsung in terms of process leadership and don't have a serious product offering in the GPU space that can take on Nvidia H100 (Gaudi 3 seems like a good competitor). And Pat Gelsinger is trying hard to bring it back on track. They have 18A process node on track to hit HVM production in 2025(?), US government is funding their fab expansion plans, Foundry is slowly winning customer, and for the next few years, compute is the new oil. Everything seems to be inline for INTC to go up like AMD and NVDA. But no, it always drops.  
  
TSLA - Eccentric owner who is more interested in peddling conspiracy theories on X that he bought on a whim. FSD was a long lost pipe dream, which never seems to be working fine , and current version has its own kinks. EV is becoming an extremely competitive market everyday with new entrants and an ongoing price war. Cybertruck was late by 2-3(?) years and has. IDK if Roadster will ever happen in this decade, Tesla Semi is another thing which seemed nice on paper but idk if it's ever really gonna happen. News reports claimed that Musk cancelled Model2. But again claims TSLA is gonna make a cheaper model ( which would probably cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales; and lets be honest - no one knows if and when that's actually coming on the roads).  
  
Can anyone explain why is the market so bullish about TSLA even after reporting lower EPS, 9% drop in revenue, and is ready to eat his words about the cheaper model like its God's truth itself, while INTC drops like a rock on the first opportunity, even though Semiconductors are the bedrock of AI and EV growth."
2024-04-24 14:15:22,daynightcase,"Bull arguments about TSLA's data advantage for autonomous, is overblown","Every bull case you will hear about why tesla is the only company ripe for FSD, you will hear one thing the most.  ""but ....MILLIONS OF MILES ON TESLA WORLDWIDE"". Just listened to Cathy Wood's latest interview, and this was her whole argument for buying more and more TSLA

This is complete BS argument, and for these people I have only one thing to say. Google was and is the king in Data, yet we have ChatGPT and Anthropics took them by surprised. They have fraction of data that google has, yet they are far better LLM model than Gemini. It clearly isn't about quantity of data, more so on quality and how  it is used to train your model.

Same thing for selfdriving, we literally have Waymo running since 2019, and now expanding to even more cities but people refuse to acknowledge. Tesla has no lead in AI, not in software or hardware. if you listened to TSLA's latest earning call, there was also no mention of dojo, and instead they kept bringing up about buying NVDA H100 to build super computer. This throws out any vertical integration argument as well.

I know people still like to drink Musk coolaid but this is not going to end well. And before you think I am one sour grape because the stock went up 12%, do check my comment history. I insisted in buying calls for yesterday's earning. But that doesn't change the fact, that tesla is going to be a dead money for a while. It IS a well run car company, with no debt and state of art manufacturing. Their only MOAT is the tesla's supercharger network. It should get higher multiple than traditional car companies no doubt. But that's about it."
2024-04-29 04:41:00,Puginator,Tesla jumps 10% in premarket trade after passing key hurdle to roll out full self-driving in China,"Shares of Tesla rose sharply in U.S. premarket trading on Monday after the electric car maker passes a significant milestone to roll out its full self-driving technology in China.

The company’s share price spiked more than 10% just after 7:30 a.m. ET, as investors reacted to news surrounding Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s visit to China.

Tesla on Sunday said that local Chinese authorities removed restrictions on its cars after passing the country’s data security requirements.

The move raised expectations that Tesla’s driver-assistance software Full Self Driving (FSD) would soon be available in the country, which is the largest market for electric vehicles.

While Tesla’s electric cars are some of the most popular vehicles in China, they have reportedly been banned from some government-related properties due to data security concerns.

Separately, the Biden administration earlier this year announced a probe into whether imported cars from China pose national security risks due to their ability to potentially collect sensitive data.

FSD is an upgrade to Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistant. Tesla has offered its FSD technology in China for years, but with a restricted feature set that limits it to operations, such as automated lane changing.

Data security concerns have been a key obstacle preventing Tesla from achieving a full rollout of the system in China.

Tesla also reportedly scored a deal with Baidu that would give Musk’s firm access to the Chinese internet giant’s mapping and navigation technology for Tesla’s FSD feature.

The agreement would allow Tesla to tap into Baidu’s mapping service license, which is a requirement for intelligence driving systems to operate on public roads in China, Reuters reported, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the matter.

CNBC was unable to independently verify the report. Tesla and Baidu were not immediately available for comment.

With the license, which foreign companies can only clinch in partnership with local Chinese firms, Tesla will be allowed to legally operate FSD on Chinese roads, and its fleets will be able to gather data about traffic, road signs and routes.

The breakthrough for Tesla toward bringing its FSD self-driving technology to China marks a key win for the firm at a time when it is facing hefty competition in the Chinese market. Local rivals such as Warren Buffett-backed electric vehicle maker BYD, Nio, and Xpeng have ramped up their competition with Tesla in recent years.

BYD was temporarily the largest electric vehicle maker globally, producing more than 3 million new energy vehicles in 2023. The firm recently lost its crown as world’s largest EV maker, after a 43% plunge in sales in the first quarter.

**US seeks answers from Tesla in Autopilot recall probe**

[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-seeks-answers-tesla-autopilot-recall-probe-2024-05-07](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-seeks-answers-tesla-autopilot-recall-probe-2024-05-07)

&#x200B;

*U.S. auto safety investigators are seeking detailed answers and documents from Tesla in a probe into the automaker's December recall of more than 2 million vehicles to install new Autopilot safeguards.*

*The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said last month it was investigating after receiving reports of 20 crashes involving vehicles that had the Autopilot software updates installed under Tesla's recall. The agency's letter said it had identified ""several concerns"", regarding the recall.*

*Tesla said in December its largest-ever recall covering 2.03 million U.S. vehicles - or nearly all of its vehicles on U.S. roads - was to better ensure drivers pay attention when using its advanced driver assistance system.*

*The NHTSA recall investigation covers models Y, X, S, 3 and Cybertruck vehicles in the U.S. equipped with Autopilot produced between the 2012 and 2024 model years.*

*Tesla, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has said repeatedly that Autopilot does not make vehicles self-driving and is intended for use with a fully attentive driver who is prepared to take over and has hands on the steering wheel.*

*NHTSA said it had sent Tesla an information request letter, which was made public on Tuesday, seeking details of the recall and documents by July 1.*

*NHTSA wants comparative data from Tesla on the performance of vehicles after receiving the recall including the number of hands on wheel warnings issued.*

*The agency said it had concerns after those 20 crashes as well as results from preliminary NHTSA tests of updated vehicles following Tesla's five-part recall remedy.*

*One issue under investigation is Tesla's recall allows drivers to set how they activate Autopilot by either allowing a single-pull or double-pull of the drive stalk.*

*NHTSA's letter said the single-pull activation of Autopilot ""is not the default setting on vehicles that received the remedy in the field"" and testing ""showed it was possible to make this change while driving.""*

*Tesla has also made additional updates to reduce crashes including high speed captive turn lane collisions that are not part of the recall.*

*NHTSA said it ""will assess the timing and driving factors behind these updates, their impacts on subject vehicle field performance, and Tesla’s basis for not including them"".*

*Last month, NHTSA said it found evidence that ""Tesla’s weak driver engagement system was not appropriate for Autopilot’s permissive operating capabilities"" and that this results in a ""critical safety gap.""*

*NHTSA said during its Autopilot safety probe launched in August 2021 that it had identified at least 13 Tesla crashes involving at least one death and many more involving serious injuries in which ""foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role.""*

*NHTSA noted Tesla's December recall ""allows a driver to readily reverse"" the software update.*

**Elon Musk proposed to launch robotaxis in China during April visit, state media report says**

&#x200B;

*Elon Musk proposed testing Tesla's advanced driver-assistance package in China by deploying it in robotaxis, during his recent visit to the country, the state-backed China Daily newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing sources.*

*Chinese officials told the Tesla CEO that China ""welcomes Tesla to do some robotaxi tests in the country"" and hopes it can ""set a good example"", the newspaper quoted the sources as saying.*

*However, Chinese authorities did not immediately approve its widespread use of Full Self-Driving (FSD) functions, the newspaper added.*

*Before the full rollout of its FSD functions, Tesla still needs to get approval to collect and transfer data that Tesla's cars need to train its driver-assistance features. The newspaper added that this issue wasn't discussed in detail during Musk's visit.*

*A person briefed on the matter told Reuters that Tesla is seeking to apply to launch the robotaxi tests in Shanghai, where the company's largest factory globally is located.*

*Tesla and the Shanghai city government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.*

*The China Daily report comes shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a whirlwind weekend trip to Beijing late last month, where he met Chinese Premier Li Qiang.*

*Musk on the trip intended to discuss the rollout of FSD and whether Tesla could secure government approvals to transfer data overseas that could prove pivotal in its development of autonomous vehicles, Reuters previously reported.*

*FSD is the most autonomous version of Autopilot software and was rolled out in 2020. Its features include self-parking, auto lane changes and traffic navigation.*

*Among the wins during Musk's trip, which was first reported by Reuters, was a key endorsement from a top Chinese auto association that said Tesla's Model 3 and Y cars were compliant with data-security regulations. That would enable local governments to allow Tesla cars into parts of China they were previously barred from, Chinese media reported, citing a statement from Tesla.*

*Tesla has also reached an agreement with Baidu to use the Chinese tech giant's mapping license for data collection on China's public roads, according to two people who at the time described that as a step toward FSD rollout in China.*

*The China Daily newspaper, however, citing a source close to Baidu, said that the deal only meant that the accuracy of Baidu's maps provided to Tesla would be improved and that it had no direct relation with FSD.*

*Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.*

*Musk has abandoned a longstanding goal for Tesla to make affordable electric cars for the masses and is looking to focus on autonomous driving software, robotaxis and its humanoid robot Optimus.*

*Last month, the company mentioned a ""purpose-built robotaxi product"" that it planned to build with a ""revolutionary"" manufacturing process, without offering a timeline for its release.*

*China has been at the forefront in the development of self-driving cars, and companies such as Baidu and Toyota-backed Pony.ai have launched robotaxi services in limited test zones in several cities.*

&#x200B;

*U.S. prosecutors are examining whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud by misleading investors and consumers about its electric vehicles’ self-driving capabilities, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.*

*Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems assist with steering, braking and lane changes - but are not fully autonomous. While Tesla has warned drivers to stay ready to take over driving, the Justice Department is examining other statements by Tesla and Chief Executive Elon Musk suggesting its cars can drive themselves.*

*U.S. regulators have separately investigated hundreds of crashes, including fatal ones, that have occurred in Teslas with Autopilot engaged, resulting in a mass recall by the automaker.*

*Reuters exclusively reported the U.S. criminal investigation into Tesla in October 2022, and is now the first to report the specific criminal liability federal prosecutors are examining.*

*Investigators are exploring whether Tesla committed wire fraud, which involves deception in interstate communications, by misleading consumers about its driver-assistance systems, the sources said. They are also examining whether Tesla committed securities fraud by deceiving investors, two of the sources said.*

*The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating Tesla’s representations about driver-assistance systems to investors, one of the people said. The SEC declined to comment.*

*Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Last October, it disclosed in a filing that the Justice Department had asked the company for information about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.*

*The Justice Department declined to comment.*

*The probe, which is not evidence of wrongdoing, could result in criminal charges, civil sanctions, or no action. Prosecutors are far from deciding how to proceed, one of the sources said, in part because they are sifting through voluminous documents Tesla provided in response to subpoenas.*

*Reuters could not determine the specific statements prosecutors are reviewing as potentially illegal. Musk has aggressively touted the prowess of Tesla’s driver-assistance technology for nearly a decade.*

*Tesla videos demonstrating the technology that remain archived on its website say: “The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.”*

*A Tesla engineer testified in 2022 in a lawsuit over a fatal crash involving Autopilot that one of the videos, posted in October 2016, intended to show the technology’s potential and did not accurately portray its capabilities at the time. Musk nevertheless posted the video on social media, writing: “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway streets, then finds a parking spot.”*

*In a conference call with reporters in 2016, Musk described Autopilot as “probably better” than a human driver. During an October 2022 call, Musk addressed a forthcoming FSD upgrade he said would allow customers to travel “to your work, your friend’s house, to the grocery store without you touching the wheel.”*

*Musk is increasingly focused on self-driving technology as Tesla's car sales and profit slump. Tesla recently slashed costs through mass layoffs and shelved plans for a long-awaited $25,000 model that had been expected to drive sales growth.*

*“Going balls to the wall for autonomy is a blindingly obvious move,” the billionaire executive posted on his social-media platform X in mid-April. Tesla shares, down more than 28% so far this year, surged in late April when Musk visited China and made progress toward approvals to sell FSD there.*

*Musk has repeatedly promised self-driving Teslas for about a decade. ""Mere failure to realize a long-term, aspirational goal is not fraud,"" Tesla lawyers said in a 2022 court filing.*

*LEGAL CHALLENGES*

*Prosecutors scrutinizing Tesla’s autonomous-car claims are proceeding with caution, recognizing the legal hurdles they face, the people familiar with the inquiry said.*

*They will need to demonstrate that Tesla’s claims crossed a line from legal salesmanship to material and knowingly false statements that unlawfully harmed consumers or investors, three legal experts uninvolved in the probe told Reuters.*

*U.S. courts previously have ruled that “puffery” or “corporate optimism” regarding product claims do not amount to fraud. In 2008, a federal appeals court ruled that statements of corporate optimism alone do not demonstrate that a company official intentionally misled investors.*

*Justice Department officials will likely seek internal Tesla communications as evidence that Musk or others knew they were making false statements, said Daniel Richman, a Columbia Law School professor and former federal prosecutor. That is a challenge, Richman said, but the safety risk involved in overselling self-driving systems also “speaks to the seriousness with which prosecutors, a judge and jury would take the statements.”*

*FATAL CRASHES*

*Tesla’s claims about Autopilot and FSD have also drawn scrutiny in regulatory investigations and lawsuits.*

*Safety regulators and courts have raised concerns in recent months that corporate messaging about the technology - including the brand names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving - have imbued customers with a false sense of security.*

*In April, the Washington State Patrol arrested a man on suspicion of vehicular homicide after his Tesla, with Autopilot engaged, struck and killed a motorcyclist while the driver looked at his phone, police records show. In a probable-cause statement, a trooper cited the driver’s “admitted inattention to driving, while on autopilot mode ... putting trust in the machine to drive for him.”*

*In Washington state, a driver remains ""responsible for the safe and legal operation of that vehicle"" regardless of its technological capabilities, a state patrol spokesperson told Reuters.*

*The same month, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation into whether a Tesla recall of more than 2 million vehicles in December adequately addressed safety issues with Autopilot.*

*NHTSA declined to comment.*

*The recall followed a long-running probe opened by regulators after cars with Autopilot engaged repeatedly crashed into vehicles at first-responder emergency scenes. Regulators subsequently examined hundreds of crashes where Autopilot was engaged and identified 14 deaths and 54 injuries.*

*Tesla disputed NHTSA's findings but agreed to the recall, which employed over-the-air software updates intended to alert inattentive drivers.*

*The NHTSA investigation found “a critical safety gap between drivers’ expectations” of Tesla’s technology “and the system’s true capabilities,” according to agency records. “This gap led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes.”*"

Leave it to Tesla CEO Elon Musk to add more chaos to a situation that he ostensibly created in the first place.

In a tweet on X early Friday morning, Musk addressed concerns many have had over his recent move to shrink down Tesla’s (TSLA) Supercharger team.

“Just to reiterate: Tesla will spend well over $500M expanding our Supercharger network to create thousands of NEW chargers this year,” Musk wrote. “That’s just on new sites and expansions, not counting operations costs, which are much higher.”

Shortly thereafter, Musk also started a “Supercharger Community” on X, where members can discuss and share stories on the topic.

Whether Musk’s proclamation that Tesla is still heavily investing in the Supercharger is accurate or not is another story, but the industry, investors, and EV owners are seeking clarity and demanding answers.

Last week Musk and Tesla laid off nearly the entire Supercharger organization, which was responsible for the build-out of its best-in-class charging network. In the aftermath of the initial layoffs, Musk addressed the Supercharger news on X, stating that the network will grow at “a slower pace” for new locations.

Automakers like GM, Ford, Kia, Polestar, Stellantis, Honda, and others had signed up to access the Supercharger network, and incorporate Tesla’s NACS plug inlet in their future vehicles, under the promise that the Supercharger network would continue to grow at a steady pace.

Tesla was likely getting an earful from its NACS partners, questioning what they were getting exactly after signing deals to access the Supercharger network.

In addition, contractors and others working with Tesla on existing Supercharger projects were getting their emails bounced back with no feedback on what to do next. Tesla also apparently backed out of leases at four upcoming Supercharger sites in New York, per EV blog Electrek.

Charging network provider EVgo told Yahoo Finance that it was “actively engaged” in the development of the NACS network and was adding more locations to take advantage of Tesla’s move to backtrack its expansion.

EVgo competitor Blink Charging is also poised to move on the opportunity, claiming potential Supercharger customers contacted Blink about future orders in the wake of Tesla’s move.

Even oil and gas stalwarts like BP are moving in on Tesla. With its BP Pulse charging network, the company said it “is aggressively looking to acquire real estate to scale our network, which is a heightened focus following the recent Tesla announcement.”

The company’s top executive is even telling Tesla’s jilted partners to give him a ring.

“If there are stranded real estate partners who are looking for someone to call, they should feel free to pick up the phone and call me or look me up on LinkedIn,” BP Pulse Americas CEO Sujay Sharma told Bloomberg.

BYD released figures earlier this month showing it sold 313,245 NEVs in April, up 48.96 percent from a year earlier and up 3.57 percent from March. The figures are wholesale sales and include both passenger cars and commercial vehicles.

China's passenger NEVs sold 674,000 units at retail in April, up 28.3 percent from a year ago but down 5.7 percent from March, CPCA data released yesterday showed.

Tesla's retail sales in China in April were 31,421 units, down 21.4 percent from a year ago, and ranked No. 5 with a 4.6 percent share.

In the CPCA's March retail sales rankings of NEVs released last month, Tesla was No. 2 with an 8.8 percent share, behind BYD's 36.6 percent.

It's worth noting that in China, NEVs include battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and fuel-cell vehicles. BYD produces PHEVs and BEVs, while Tesla only produces BEVs.

Tesla sold 62,167 China-made vehicles in April, including 30,746 exported, according to CPCA data released yesterday.

Tesla has a factory in Shanghai that produces the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, both for deliveries to local customers and as an export hub for it.

Tesla's pattern is to produce cars for export in the first half of the quarter and for the local market in the second half, it previously said.

Geely's retail sales of NEVs in April were up 76.3 percent at 49,155 units, placing it at No. 2 with a 7.3 percent share.

Changan Automobile's NEV retail sales in April were up 119 percent to 40,507 units, placing it 3rd with a 6 percent share.

In the January-April period, BYD's NEV retail sales were 840,137 units, up 19.6 percent year-on-year, and ranked No. 1 with a 34.3 percent share.

FAW-Volkswagen sold 119,032 units at retail in April, down 15.6 percent year-on-year, and ranked No. 2 with a 7.8 percent share.

Geely had retail sales of 115,723 units in April, up 31.2 percent year-on-year, to take 3rd place with a 7.6 percent share.

In the January-April period, BYD was No. 1 in China's passenger car market with a 13.2 percent share, FAW-Volkswagen was No. 2 with an 8.1 percent share and Geely was No. 3 with a 7.9 percent share.

China NEV retail falls to 674,000 in Apr, penetration reaches record 43.7%."
2024-05-18 20:10:31,Puginator,"As Tesla layoffs continue, here are 600 jobs the company cut in California ","As part of Tesla’s massive restructuring, the electric-vehicle maker notified the California Employment Development Department this week that it’s cutting approximately 600 more employees at its manufacturing facilities and engineering offices between Fremont and Palo Alto.

The latest round of layoffs eliminated roles across the board — from entry-level positions to directors — and hit an array of departments, impacting factory workers, software developers and robotics engineers.

The cuts were reported in a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, Act filing that CNBC obtained through a public records request.

Facing both weakening demand for Tesla electric vehicles and increased competition, the company has been slashing its headcount since at least January. CEO Elon Musk told employees in a memo in April that the company would cut more than 10% of its global workforce, which totaled 140,473 employees at the end of 2023.

Previous filings revealed that Tesla would cut more than 6,300 jobs across California; Austin, Texas; and Buffalo, New York.

Musk said on Tesla’s quarterly earnings call on April 23 that the company had built up a 25% to 30% “inefficiency” over the past several years, implying the layoffs underway could impact tens of thousands more employees than the 10% number would suggest.

According to the WARN filing, the 378 job cuts in Fremont, home to Tesla’s first U.S. manufacturing plant, included people involved in staffing and running vehicle assembly. There were 65 cuts at the company’s Kato Rd. battery development center.

Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Among the highest-level roles eliminated in Fremont were two environmental health and safety directors, and a user experience design director.

In Palo Alto, home to the company’s engineering headquarters, 233 more employees, including two directors of technical programs, lost their jobs.

Tesla has also terminated a majority of employees involved in designing and improving apps made for customers and employees, according to two former employees directly familiar with the matter. The WARN filing shows that to be the case, with many cut from the team at Tesla’s Hanover Street location in Palo Alto.

Tesla faces reduced demand for cars it makes in Fremont, including its older Model S and X vehicles and Model 3 sedan. Total deliveries dropped in the first quarter from a year earlier, and Tesla reported its steepest year-over-year revenue decline since 2012.

An onslaught of competition, especially in China, has continued to pressure Tesla’s sales in the second quarter. Xiaomi and Nio have each launched new EV models, which undercut the price of Tesla’s most popular vehicles.

Tesla’s stock price has tumbled about 30% so far this year, while the S&P 500 is up 11%.

Musk has been trying to convince investors not to focus on vehicle sales and instead to back Tesla’s potential to finally deliver self-driving software, a robotaxi, and a “sentient” humanoid robot. Musk and Tesla have long promised customers self-driving software that would turn their existing EVs into robotaxis, but the company’s systems still require constant human supervision.

Other recent job cuts at Tesla included the team responsible for building out the Supercharger, or electric-vehicle fast-charging network, in the U.S.

Tesla disclosed plans in its annual filing for 2023 to grow and optimize its charging infrastructure “to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.” Tesla said in the filing that it needed to expand its “network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer demands,” after other auto companies announced plans to adopt the North American Charging Standard.

Since cutting most of its Supercharger team, Tesla has reportedly started to rehire at least some members, a move reminiscent of the job cuts Musk made at Twitter after he bought the company and later rebranded it as X. Musk told CNBC’s David Faber last year that he wanted to rehire some of those he let go.

2024-05-31 06:52:58,Puginator,Top proxy advisor ISS recommends against Elon Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay package ,"Top proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday recommended Tesla shareholders vote against the re-approval of CEO Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay package and withhold their support from the re-election of News Corp. scion James Murdoch to the automaker’s board.

Tesla’s shareholder meeting is on June 13.

The report, a copy of which was obtained by CNBC, comes after the other influential proxy advisor service, Glass Lewis, also recommended shareholders vote against Musk’s pay package. Tesla’s board is seeking shareholder approval to reinstate Musk’s pay after a Delaware court voided the package earlier this year.

ISS said “cautionary” shareholder support was merited for Tesla’s plans to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas, although the proxy advisor also warned that there are concerns over how Tesla’s board decided to reincorporate and over the “unknown” nature of Texas’s business law framework.

The proxy advisor recommended support for some shareholder proposals that Tesla management opposes, including one that would declassify Tesla’s board. A classified or staggered board is considered by some advisors to be an effective defense against a takeover bid.

“At a mega-cap company like Tesla, what is perhaps even more relevant to shareholders is that a staggered board can hinder shareholders from holding directors accountable for poor responsiveness,” ISS said of its support for the declassification proposal.

Pay package push

Tesla has been courting shareholder support in both time-tested and novel ways. The company engaged communications firm FGS Global and proxy solicitor Innisfree M&A to win votes, and has bolstered apparent grassroots support from its large network of social-media influencers. The company also launched a website, VoteTesla.com, and has offered shareholders the chance to win a tour of Tesla’s Gigafactory facility in Austin.

Tesla seeks shareholder approval for Musk’s payday and concurrently to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas. The company has characterized the Delaware chancery court ruling that overturned Musk’s stock package as unfriendly to shareholders, noting the value that Musk has created for investors.

“Over the last several years it has become clear that Delaware is no longer the right jurisdiction for us,” Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said in a letter to shareholders earlier this week.

Tesla has adopted tactics other companies have used in contested shareholder meetings, whipping votes and launching a concerted public-relations effort to win support. While Tesla is not facing any sort of meaningful organized opposition to its efforts to reincorporate or re-approve Elon’s pay package, some shareholders have come out against it. Billionaire Leo KoGuan has repeatedly said he will vote against the package. KoGuan says he owns around 0.75% of Tesla shares, worth around $4.9 billion.

Proxy advisor pull

ISS and its smaller peer Glass Lewis are an important factor in how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Their recommendations are closely watched in contested situations but are not definitive calls. Still, they have developed a reputation for being important bellwethers and seek to advocate for shareholders.

They’ve also been the direct target of Musk’s ire. Earlier this year on an earnings call, he compared ISS to the terrorist organization ISIL, also known as ISIS. Musk also said they “effectively control the stock market” on X in 2023, saying they had outsize influence over so-called “passive” or institutional shareholders.

Institutional shareholders like BlackRock and Vanguard, however, do not always vote with ISS recommendations. While voting decisions are generally not disclosed until well after a shareholder meeting, those institutional shareholders have due diligence teams that help them decide how to cast the millions of shares they manage on behalf of their investors.

ISS in its report said its prior concerns over the pay package, which dates back to 2018, had not been mitigated and that it “remains excessive,” noting that “the board has effectively only offered shareholders an ‘all or nothing’ option in this vote.”

The proxy advisor alluded to Musk’s myriad other business ventures such as social media platform X, his AI startup xAI and SpaceX, as another reason why Tesla shareholders should not support the pay package.

“The grant, in many ways, failed to achieve the board’s other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavors, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders,” ISS said.

I don’t really have any goals in the long term or short term so I don’t really mind individual stocks or ETFs. I just hate seeing a downward trend for the past year and not sure if my money would be better in the SP500. I also don’t want to preemptively sell and have it skyrocket past my purchase price. All opinions would be appreciated!

For context:

From what I have read so far, it appears the result will be declared in the Annual shareholder meeting on 13-jun. Is that correct interpretation ?

If this is not correct, do you know when will shareholders get to know about the result ? Will there also be a call/web-conference that one can attend to know the results as they are declared?

2024-06-13 05:27:15,Puginator,Tesla pops 6% in premarket after Elon Musk says he is set for victory in $56 billion pay vote ,"Shares of Tesla popped in premarket trading, after Elon Musk said shareholders are set to approve his controversial $56 billion pay package and a resolution to move the electric carmaker’s incorporation to Texas.

At 08:12 a.m. ET on Thursday, Tesla shares were 6.39% higher in premarket trading.

Tesla shareholders have been voting on two resolutions and can have their say up to the company’s annual meeting on Thursday. The first measure under consideration is whether to green light a $56 billion pay package that shareholders originally approved in 2018, before being voided by a Delaware judge in January.

The second resolution is whether Tesla should transfer its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas. That proposal was put forward after Musk asked his followers on social media platform X earlier this year whether Tesla should carry out such a move — to a resounding yes.

Musk now said that both of these resolutions are currently passing by “wide margins,” without disclosing specifics or his sourcing.

CNBC has reached out to Tesla for comment.

The initial pay package had aggressive targets for Tesla’s financial performance and market value — and, while the company has turned into one of the world’s largest electric automakers, a lot has changed since 2018.

Tesla is facing slowing growth and increased competition, especially from Chinese players. In that time, Musk also bought Twitter, now called X, and has ramped up focus on other projects, including in his brain computer interface firm Neuralink and artificial intelligence company xAI.

Critics of the pay deal argue that Musk is distracted by his other endeavors, and that the package, the largest in U.S. corporate history, is excessive. More recently, they say that Tesla’s financial performance has not been up to scratch.

Some notable shareholders have said they planned to vote against the deal, and top proxy advisors Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis also recommended this step. The California State Teachers’ Retirement System, a massive pension fund, likewise objected to the package, claiming the sum was too high. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has similarly come out in opposition.

Shareholders in favor of the compensation argue that Musk is integral to Tesla’s future success and that the billionaire will take his efforts elsewhere if he is not reimbursed adequately. They claim that the pay package has incentivized Musk.

Billionaire investor and long-time Tesla shareholder Ron Baron said he is voting in favor of the pay package, suggesting that Musk is key to the EV maker’s future.

“At Baron Capital, our answer is clear, loud, and unequivocal: Tesla is better with Elon. Tesla is Elon,” he said this month.

Some major investors, such as Vanguard and Blackrock, have meanwhile not said how they will cast their votes.

List of things going for TSLA into the second half of the year.

-pay package approved, now incorporated in TX, a massive hurdle out of the way

-Optimus robot. Wouldn't be surprised if there was a Iron man suit in the works (probably a top secret project?)

-License approved to test FSD is China

-FSD 12.4.1 release soon.

-Robo taxi announcement less than two month away(August 8th). RIP $Uber

-Model 3 Long Range now qualifies for the $7,500 tax credit. This will boost $ales.

-GM, Toyota, Honda and Ford cutting their production on EV's gives Telsa the opportunity to take more market share. More Tesla's on the road? More Robo taxi'$ to operate. More people using robo taxi, no need to buy a car from GM or Ford or Toyota.

-Master Plan Part 4 (Release date TBD)

-New products in the pipeline. They will certainly bring back the $25K car.

-Europe imposed a massive tarriff on Chinese made EV's. Good for Telsa.

-USA tariff on Chinese cars? 100%!!! , no competition from china here.

-Expansion in India is certain, just a matter of when.

The big short: Tesla is one of the most shorted stock in the market(Dollar Volume Sold Short$18.04 billion) with 1.1 days to cover. Tesla has been know to have massive +$30-$40 days, the faster shorts cover the faster we go to $280, my PT.

TSLA reminds me of Apple a few months ago trading at low $170's with not much excitement, now its near $220.

I have TSLA $205 call for July 26, i fully expect TSLA to reach the moon before the Robo taxi release. The time may be running out to get cheap calls.

Lastly the debate is over, Telsa is a Tech company, its a conglomerate like GE once was."

2024-06-22 10:09:26,Puginator,Tesla internal data shows company has slashed at least 14% of workforce this year ,"Tesla’s hefty downsizing since 2023 has reduced its global head count to just over 121,000 people, including temporary workers, internal records suggest, indicating that the automaker has slashed more than 14% of its workforce so far this year.

The latest figure is not from precise payroll data, but from the number of people who are on Tesla’s “everybody” email distribution list as of June 17, a tally viewed by CNBC.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent an email to “everybody” that day. He told employees, “Over the next few weeks, Tesla will be doing a comprehensive review to provide stock options grants for exceptional performance.” He added that options grants will also be awarded to “anyone who does something outstanding for the company.” Tesla’s plan to reinstitute options grants, after previously pausing performance-based equity awards, was reported first by Reuters.

Tesla’s layoffs announcement landed in April, when Musk sent out a companywide email telling employees that the automaker would be cutting more than 10% of its staff. Layoffs at that point were already underway.

Bloomberg reported that Musk was aiming for a 20% staff cut. Musk indicated that the number could be even bigger. On the company’s first-quarter earnings call later in April, he said Tesla had reached an inefficiency level of 25% to 30% after “a long period of prosperity” that began in 2019.

“We’ve made some corrections along the way,” Musk said on the call. “But it is time to reorganize the company for the next phase of growth.”

In a filing for the fourth quarter, Tesla said its employee head count worldwide at the end of December was 140,473, a number that represents salaried and hourly staffers. The “everybody” email list includes temporary workers. At around 121,000, that suggests Tesla has reduced overall headcount by at least 14% since the end of 2023.

Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

In at least one instance, Musk’s head-count reductions went too far. Tesla dismantled its Supercharging team, which consisted of hundreds of employees, including its leader, Rebecca Tinucci. The company later hired some of those people back, according to posts on LinkedIn.

The broader cuts coincide with a slippage in sales at Tesla as the company reckons with an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China as well as brand deterioration that a recent survey attributed partly to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.” For the first quarter, Tesla reported a 9% drop in annual revenue, the biggest decline since 2012.

Across the auto industry, EV sales growth slowed this year after two years of rapid expansion. The slide was particularly acute for Tesla, whose Model Y was the top-selling car worldwide in 2023.

A Tesla employee, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive internal issues, told CNBC that some factory workers are fearful more layoffs could follow in July, depending on second-quarter results.

A production and deliveries report for the second quarter is expected from Tesla during the first week of July.

Musk has promised investors the company will soon publish a new “Master Plan,” which would be his fourth, and that Tesla will reveal its design for a “dedicated robotaxi” on Aug. 8.

Tesla shares were little changed on Friday at $181.71. The stock is down 27% this year, while the Nasdaq is up 18%.

2024-06-25 13:19:39,AmiiboAvenger,At what point do you cut your losses?,"I’m new to investing. Been doing it about two months and overall have better returns than just leaving the money in a high yield savings account.

One of the first trades I did was buying TSLA at about 170. It ended up dropping to 165 or so and I sold to prevent losses. It dropped to the 140s but obviously now it is in the 180s. I accepted a loss when holding for not even that much longer would have made decent profit.

After I learned a lesson about patience there, I’ve been trying to hold, but a few choices I’ve made don’t show signs of rebounding (SEDG is down 20% today and has been decreasing pretty steadily since I bought in).

I’m still undecided if I’d like to cut my losses and try to invest in something that will give more returns in the meantime, or if I hope that the solar sector has a strong rebound in the (very) long term and just continue to hold.

In your experience, when do you cut your losses? Do you have any examples of sells that saved you money, or sells that you regret?"

*Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter fell 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier but rose 14.8% from the first quarter.*

*Tesla on Tuesday reported a smaller-than-expected 5% drop in vehicle deliveries in the second quarter, as the electric carmaker's price cuts and incentives helped mitigate cooling demand.*

*Shares of the world's most valuable automaker rallied more than 10% on Tuesday, hitting the highest level in nearly six months.*

*The higher-than-expected deliveries data ""greatly assuages concerns regarding softening EV demand,"" CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson said. ""The stock continues to ride a wave of positive momentum following its annual meeting in mid-June in which shareholders re-approved Musk’s 2018 compensation plan,"" he said, referring to CEO Elon Musk.*

Everything below this line was written before the release of P&D numbers \~

&#x200B;

TSLA is going to release its 2024Q2 P&D numbers in the next couple of hours, WS analysts think that total delivery could reach 438,019 (vs 466,140, i.e. around 6% YoY drop).

In my opinion, 438K is still far too high based on continuous checking shared by a lot of non-WS analysts - which is supported by the data regularly released in Mainland China, Europe and the United States. The educated estimates should be ranging from 415K to 420K, implying at least 9% YoY decline.

Recall in January 2024's investor call that Mr. CEO was saying TSLA is between two major growth waves while no further guidance was provided (very tricky to be honest), does it mean ""low growth"" or actually ""no growth""?

More information will be followed post the release of 2024Q2 numbers ...

**Tesla deliveries set to fall for second straight quarter**

*Tesla's June-quarter deliveries likely fell 6%, the first time the top EV maker is set to post two straight quarters of decline, as it deals with stiff competition in China and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models.*

*The company is expected to deliver 438,019 vehicles for the April to June period, according to an average estimate based on forecasts from 12 analysts polled by LSEG, seven of whom slashed their expectations in the past three months. The EV maker is expected to announce the results on Tuesday.*

*Tesla has hit a speed bump after years of rapid growth that helped make it the world's most valuable automaker. It warned in January that deliveries growth in 2024 would be ""notably lower"" as a boost from months-long price cuts wanes.*

*Tesla's June sales of China-made electric vehicles fell 24.2% from a year earlier to 71,007, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed on Tuesday.*

*Deliveries of the U.S. automaker's China-made Model 3 and Model Y vehicles fell 2.2% from May levels.*

*Chinese rival BYD with its Dynasty and Ocean lineups of EVs and plug-in hybrids, sold 340,211 passenger vehicles in June, up 35.2% year on year.*"
2024-07-02 06:29:33,Puginator,"Tesla reports 443,956 deliveries in second quarter, a 4.8% decrease from last year ","Tesla just posted its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers for 2024.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles

Total production Q2 2024: 410,831 vehicles

Tesla’s numbers beat Wall Street estimates. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.

Troy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories — Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles — but doesn’t report numbers for individual models or specific regions.

Tesla’s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.

In April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, “primarily due to lower average selling price.”

Sluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla’s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.

But the sales drop also correlated with Tesla’s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”

Tesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.

Tesla has offered a range of discounts and other incentives this year to try spur sales.

In China, Tesla is currently offering a zero-interest loan as an incentive to get customers to buy a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its 2023 annual filing, Tesla generated about $21.75 billion of its overall revenue from China, representing 22.5% of total sales.

Colin Langan, an analyst at Wells Fargo, issued a report on Monday, saying the firm sees “declining delivery growth driven by lower demand & diminished return on price cuts.” He recommends selling Tesla shares.

Wells Fargo expects automotive gross margins at Tesla, not including environmental credits, to fall given the “likelihood of more price cuts & lower volumes” as the year continues.

Investor focus will now shift to Tesla’s second-quarter earnings report later this month, and a separate marketing event planned for August, when the company intends to reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi or “CyberCab.”

Like they release all the total shares of the company at the public offering, and then after it is simply the public trading in the market and determining the share price value. 
The reason this question has come up is in regards to a dividend payment. Is it my share of the profits (free money) or are they taking away from their share price to pay for the dividend? I didnt know companies had the power to do that other than through a stock split. So Im deeply confused. "

2024-07-10 19:13:48,Anonymous_Chipmunk,"RIVN, What are your thoughts?","I've been paying attention to Rivian (RIVN) and I'm holding for the long term. Historical performance has been poor, they IPO'd way over valued to raise funds, but what they're doing is expensive. It's no news that they're hemorrhaging money, citing a loss of $40,000 per vehicle sold (down from $67,000 last year). But in the last 3 months they've had some very promising announcements.

During the recent investor day webinar they talked about how Gen 1 was all about proof of concept, but now they're moving onto Gen 2 which is about manufacturing efficiency. They detailed how they reduced components, steps and fasteners to decrease production and assembly costs. It all sounds very good. In addition they just entered a deal with VW for $5 Billion and all Rivian is supplying to VW is software. It's a stepped plan, $1B up front and additional investments based on performance.

If they reduce manufacturing costs as they predict, and lower sale price as they promised, I'm thinking this stock could be ripe for big growth. They're the only company competing directly with Tesla, and on the consumer side, it's going well. I doubt we'll ever see a RIVN selling at comparable prices to TSLA, but I could see them over $100 in a few years if they continue to make advancements.

Thoughts?

I'm in at $11/share."

Berkshire lowered its stake in BYD's issued H-shares to 4.94% from 5.06% on July 16, according to a Monday filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The stake had been 7.02% as recently as June 11.
Hong Kong requires larger shareholders to disclose, opens new tab sales when their resulting stakes fall below whole percentage numbers. Disclosures can stop once ownership stakes fall below 5%.
Berkshire began investing in Shenzhen-based BYD in 2008 when it paid $230 million for about 225 million shares, then equal to a 10% stake.
It began selling BYD shares in August 2022, after the stock price had risen more than 20-fold, and two months after it set a record high.
Charlie Munger, Berkshire's late vice chairman, was the impetus behind the original BYD investment. Berkshire invests mainly in the United States.
BYD was founded by Chinese chemist Wang Chuanfu in 1995 as a maker of rechargeable batteries.
It surpassed billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab last year as the world's largest electric vehicle maker, though Tesla has since regained the top spot. In the second quarter, BYD sold 426,039 electric vehicles while Tesla sold 443,956.

Microsoft’s revenue increased 15% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $22.04 billion, was up from $20.08 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% during the quarter. Analysts polled by CNBC and StreetAccount had expected 31% growth. Microsoft doesn’t disclose revenue from the category in dollars. Last week Google parent Alphabet said revenue from its cloud business, encompassing Workspace productivity software and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, went up by about 29%. 

During the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft started selling Surface PCs with AI features that can run certain models locally without the need for an internet connection. Dell, HP and other device makers also touted their own so-called Copilot+ PCs. CEO Satya Nadella said at a press briefing in May that “we’re bringing real joy and a sense of wonder back to creation on the PC.”

While I recognize that investing is a long-term game, the process feels slow at times. I'm curious to hear from others who have pursued a similar passive investing strategy.

How long did it take for your portfolio to reach a point where the annual passive income matched or exceeded your annual salary? When did you feel comfortable enough with your portfolio's performance and size to consider retiring or achieving financial independence. Specifically, how long did it take before you felt your portfolio could sustain your lifestyle without the need for additional income from employment?"
2024-08-25 23:44:24,NeighborhoodOld7075,Morgan Stanley is cutting its position in Tesla stock. Here's why,"It seems that Morgan Stanley has finally seen the writing on the wall.

Morgan Stanley said it is slashing its position in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, citing a “continued slowdown in the auto industry, intense competition among electric vehicles (EVs) and reduced consumer preferences” for EVs.

TSLA has been a part of Morgan Stanley’s model portfolio since March 2021, with the position increased in both September and December 2022. However, the stock was reduced in November 2023.

Since the last stake boost in December 2022, Tesla has delivered a 15% return, trailing the Russell 1000 Growth Index (RLG) by 46%, Morgan Stanley strategists highlighted.

“While we continue to hold a position in TSLA, due to the optionality of its various nonauto assets, we see an attractive opportunity to reallocate some of the position to other, less-volatile stocks that are not as economically sensitive and may have less pricing pressure,” they wrote.

Despite Tesla’s status as the leading electric vehicle company in the U.S., with potential growth avenues in robotics, AI, and energy storage, the strategists have decided to reduce the position to make room for stocks with higher earnings viability such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).

Earlier this week, the European Union announced that it would reduce planned tariffs on Tesla vehicles imported from China, lowering them from 20.8% to 9%. The EU is also cutting planned import duties for several other electric vehicle manufacturers.

These new tariffs will be in addition to the existing 10% duties already imposed by the EU on battery electric vehicle imports.

In June, the EU indicated it would impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, arguing that these vehicles ""heavily benefit from unfair subsidies"" and present a ""threat of economic injury"" to European EV producers."

Mercedes-Benz Group AG adjusts full-year guidance for the year 2024 based on current market outlook

Stuttgart, Germany - As a result of recent developments, Mercedes-Benz Group AG today adjusted its earnings outlook for the year 2024 for Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Group.

This was triggered by a further deterioration of the macroeconomic environment, mainly in China. GDP growth in China lost further momentum amid weaker consumption as well as the continued downturn in the real estate sector. This affected the overall sales volume in China including sales in the Top-End segment. Overall, the sales mix in the second half of 2024 is expected to remain unchanged versus the first half, and therefore weaker than originally expected.

Additionally, the second half of 2024 is expected to be impacted by various valuation adjustments. Furthermore, the dynamic pricing environment is expected to continue.

Therefore, Mercedes-Benz Group has updated its full-year outlook:

Mercedes-Benz Cars now expects the adjusted Return on Sales to be between 7.5% and 8.5% (previously: 10% to 11%). This implies an expected adjusted Return on Sales of around 6% for the second half of the year. The valuation adjustments are expected to have an impact of around 1 percentage point in the second half of this year.
Mercedes-Benz Vans’ expected adjusted Return on Sales (14% to 15%) and Mercedes-Benz Mobility’s expected adjusted Return on Equity (8.5% to 9.5%) remain unchanged.
Mercedes-Benz Group’s EBIT is now expected to be significantly below the prior year level (previously: slightly below the prior-year level).
Free cash flow of the industrial business for the Mercedes-Benz Group is now expected to be significantly below the prior-year level (previously: slightly below the prior-year level).

2024-09-27 03:04:39,NeighborhoodOld7075,'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition',"* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**

  
Data reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:

* Waymo: 17,311 miles
* **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles
* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles
* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles

The **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  


**Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the “liability of putting something this dangerous on roads.”

  
According to Ark’s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla’s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.

Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.



In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30

2024-10-01 08:23:05,acg7,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|1933.5|10.91||
|1940|12.05|10.44%|
|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|
|1953|26.38|43.13%|
|1959.5|58.68|122%|
|1966|92.88|58%|
|1972.5|107.14|15%|

|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|
|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. 

**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**

2024-10-02 06:10:06,Puginator,"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter","Tesla posted its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell about 2% in premarket trading after the report.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890

Total production Q3 2024: 469,796

Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.

Deliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It’s one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.

In the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.

Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.

In the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.

GM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla’s, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company’s total sales.

Ford plans to report results on Wednesday.

Tesla hasn’t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.

The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.

Shares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.

Tesla’s brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called “racist hate,” and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.

But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.

In its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.

Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of “dedicated robotaxi.”

Musk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress","Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June."
2024-10-12 08:03:00,Sotarif,"Ride-sharing giants Uber, Lyft jump after Tesla’s ‘toothless taxi’ fails to excite investors","Tesla’s hyped robotaxi unveiling posed a threat to Uber’s ride-sharing aspirations, but it has turned into a boon for the stock instead.

Uber shares had been falling on the initial investor excitement leading up to Thursday’s event — particularly slumping in early August and mid-September — but surged more than 9% on Friday on renewed enthusiasm that the company is well positioned to advance its autonomous vehicle offerings. The move pushed the stock to a 52-week high and it was leading the S&P 500 higher during the session.

That is a massive turnaround for Uber’s stock, which is now up nearly 22% over the past month and about 38% for the year. Lyft, another major player, is also surging about 10% on Friday. By comparison, Tesla’s shares are plunging during Friday’s trading session and are down more than 11% this year, vastly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, which have each gained around 22% so far this year.

The buzz around Tesla’s highly anticipated cybercab has largely dissipated due to a lack of detail on its latest full self-driving technology advancements and the company’s failure to provide insight on its ride-sharing service strategy or economics, among other expectations investors had.

“TSLA’s toothless taxi is a best-case outcome for UBER,” Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a Friday note, noting that the electric car maker provided ambitious targets but little signs of feasibility.

2024-10-23 13:16:25,thelastsubject123,Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat,"* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

# 

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.

# More than just EVs

Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. ""As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time,"" noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.

# Balance sheet

Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.

**SUMMARY**

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our ""We, Robot"" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors."

How does that work ?","As the title said, I got offered a job as a contractor at a startup company (a private one). They demand 20hrs/week minimum, at 40$/hr. At the end end of the month, I'll get compensation in stock only based on the hours I worked. The contract also says the stock is at 1$ ""preferred"". How does it work ? I never got paid in stock before, and I have noo idea how to liquidate it when I need actual cash in my bank account. I live in Morocco. The company's abroad.

I have never sold or bought stock so any help is appreciated. Some of my questions are:  
What if need cash on hand? Can I just sell easily ?

What if there's no one to sell to ?

What if the company goes bankrupt ?

Should I contact my bank to convert the stock into money ?

Does it take long to convert ?

Is it as reliable as cash in your bank account ?

Also, any taxes I should worry about ?

EDIT ===========

Thank you all for the helpful comments ! I definitely won't take that job, might try to negotiate actual payment (prolly wont get it, but that's as far as I'll go.)

2024-10-30 06:15:05,Puginator,Volkswagen profit plunges 42% in third quarter amid sweeping overhaul plans,"German automaker Volkswagen on Wednesday reported a 42% drop in operating profit in the third quarter.

Operating profit fell to 2.86 billion euros ($3.1 billion), while third quarter sales revenues slipped 0.5% year on year to around 78.5 billion euros.

Vehicle sales fell 8.3% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same time period a year earlier, Volkswagen said.

Net liquidity across the Volkswagen Group stood at negative 160.6 billion euros at the end of September 2024, it said. The company’s net liquidity stood at negative 147.4 billion euros at the end of 2023.

Volkswagen on Wednesday said that its results across the first three quarters of the year were impacted by higher fixed costs and restructuring efforts. Operating profit between January and September of this year was 21% lower on an annual basis.

Volkswagen shares were were last 1.8% higher at 8:19 a.m. London time.

Arno Antlitz, chief financial officer and chief operating officer at Volkswagen Group, said the performance reflected a “challenging market environment” and highlighted the importance of ongoing performance programs across the company.

The third quarter results come after Volkswagen last month cut its 2024 annual outlook for the second time in just a few months. At the time, the car maker said it was expecting a profit margin of around 5.6% for the year, along with a 0.7% drop in sales to 320 billion euros. Those figures were left unchanged on Wednesday.

Volkswagen has been in hot water in recent months, warning of potential plant closures in Germany and scrapping a slew of labor agreements with local workers in September. The company also said it would end its employment protection agreement, which has been in place for its German workforce since 1994.

On Monday, the Volkswagen works council said the company’s management was planning widespread pay cuts and layoffs, as well as the closure or size reduction of all of its German plants.

In response, Volkswagen reiterated the need for restructuring and said that it would present plans for work cost cuts during a round of negotiations about the labor agreements, which is also taking place on Wednesday.

“Ahead of the negotiations today, we need to state: the situation is getting more serious,” Volkswagen’s chief negotiator Arne Meiswinkel said on Wednesday according to a CNBC translation.

He added that current developments in the auto industry in Europe and especially in Germany were concerning, as shown by the latest figures from both the company and its competitors.

Meiswinkel reiterated that Volkswagen needed to lower costs and increase its efficiency to be in a position that allows it to invest in its future.

2024-11-09 19:53:52,ReindeerApart5536,Future of Energy Stocks ,"So I've been doing some research about energy stocks, here are some of my thoughts:

Clean energy stocks have been dropping significantly in these few days, but I am optismistic it will go up in the forseeable future, here's why:

1: Solar and Offshore Wind are fundamentally more cost effective than natural gas alternatives, meaning these are profitable business model that businesses will develop regardless of government subsidies.

2: The IRA will unlikely to be fully repealed due to the massive amounts of employment it provides to red states.

3: While tariff will make clean energy projects more expensive on net, it also gradually reduces US clean energy firms' reliance on China which means a stronger future for the companies.

4: With regard to oil stocks, I believe the price of oil will drop significantly since drill baby drill which means Trump will expand oil drilling in the continental shells, so lower priced oil will reduce profit margins for oil companies, making oil stocks perform worst. 

Any other thoughts? "

2024-11-12 08:11:24,stertercsi,For TSLA is next options move ,"Last Friday's surge was clearly the result of an options Gamma Squeeze, in which a large number of people purchased call options, forcing the options market maker to buy shares, pushing the stock price further up, and then more people bought call options, and the options market maker was forced to buy more shares, and the process repeats itself!

Gamma Squeeze can make the stock price surge quickly in a short period of time, but this kind of increase is often unsustainable, because options market makers to buy a large number of shares, due to the stock price in a very high position, holding the risk is quite large, the options market makers will be the IV of the call options continue to raise, so that the operation of buying the call options become less lucrative

At this time, once someone sells a call option, the options market maker will sell shares to hedge, the stock price in a short period of time, the biggest buying momentum will disappear, the compression effect is lost, the stock price will turn down, a large number of profitable call options will also be closed, which in turn will lead to options market maker to sell more positive shares

For the next half month, we may try to move up and down first this week, but then I think TSLA is about to have a pullback close to 15%~20% or so.

Of course, these ups and downs due to the Gamma Squeeze won't change a company's long-term fundamentals, and with a share price below $300 TSLA is certainly a position to add to"
2024-11-14 15:20:26,joe_bidens_underwear,Do you think TSLA will continue to slide?,"I think everyone knows Tesla has experienced quite a run up to like $360 after Election Day. I think the most common consensus is that it’s an unwarranted “hype” run with speculation that somehow Trump will benefit Elon and Tesla. 

Yet right now it’s fallen about $50 from its height of $360. For those of us who are looking for a short term trade, do you think it will give a bounce up to $330 or so, or do you think it will continue to fall back to the mid $200s in the next week. 

I guess a lot of downward movement today may be attributed to the EV credits ending, but I’ve read that won’t affect Tesla as much as the other EV startups. 

Curious to know what you all think. "
