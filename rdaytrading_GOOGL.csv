2023-12-14 04:24:26,yiternity,Should I trust someone who only shows 1 or 2 of his trade?,"Hi everyone, 

There's some acquaintance I knew of he sort of constantly shows his 1 or 2 of his trades on the social media. He claimed to be profitable, however, he doesn't show how much his account has grown. He does not effort in trying to blank out the absolute numbers or just show the percentage. 

Should he be trusted?"
2023-12-15 14:09:21,DaviinciTrades,Just one of them days,"Just one of those days where you get discouraged as a first year trader. I am not the one to give up as I know you have to get the “battle scars” from the first 1-3 years before you start to turn a profit in this market. I just feel like this market has been pure robbery this year. I don’t just buy stock I literally stalk everything, dissect filings, keep up with conference calls and everything the company releases, even go as far as to give the CEOs follows on X. I spend countless hours looks at charts and watching price action. I feel as even with all of that their has been some serious manipulation this year. The stocks I diamond hand go to zero. The ones I sell out of run huge the next week. My winnings quickly turn to losses. Outside of charting candle patterns, trends, S&R, and price action with PR what are some things you guys do that work for you. I’m going to take a step back as I have lost close to 3k this year. I’m going to take what I have left and go to crypto for the next few months. I e already been able to recoup about $200 I’m this days this week off of a minimal investment thanks to $LADYS.X and $BONK.X . I feel like I’m the crypto world there’s not so much of that manipulation and you can trust your DD a lot more, I’m not as afraid to hold and I don’t need to be worried and constantly checking on it."
2023-12-19 05:38:45,TearRepresentative56,I'm a professional trader and this is some of my notes on what's been happening in premarket.,"Note: I tried to take on some of the feedback from yesterdays post and provide a bit more analysis, although I keep some more back for my personal notes. Hopefully you can find value in this post though.

**What happened yesterday, and thoughts on this:**

* Yesterday, SPX and Nasdaq made marginally new highs, whilst Dow was flat. This despite fed officials continuing to try to walk back rate cut optimism.
* This move higher in SPX and Nasdaq was driven by Mag7 again, with exception of Apple and Tesla. We can see the mag7 dominance by the fact that QQQ rose by 0.43%, whilst QQQEqualweight was down for much of the day.
* Oil was higher on Red Sea disruption, particularly after BP said they would not be using the Red Sea Routes after Houthi attacks. This forces them through the Suez Canal which delays oil shipments by 2 weeks on average.
* Steel stocks pumped after Nippon Steel agree deal for X, although Senator Fetterman says he intends to try to stop the deal.
* Solar stocks notable losers as Sunpower raises doubts over its ability to continue as going concern, which dragged other Solar stocks lower.
* Vix remained suppressed around 12 which is supporting the market higher.

**My Thoughts:**

* Personally seeing signs that the market is topped out. Saw Tesla reached resistance near 260 but got rejected. NVDA now trading at 500, which I think is a psychological level that sellers will be sitting at, so would expect it to get rejected there over next few days. Apple trading near 200, which I think will be a psychological level sellers will be at. To be honest, I would have expected Apple to be down more than 0.85% with news of Apple Watch sales being paused and China accelerating their Apple ban in government institutions.
* Snapchat got a very bullish analyst upgrade but was flat on the day, which can be a sign madcaps are topping out too after a very bullish run.
* Nasdaq (IXIC, not NDX) now coming close to 15k which will see sellers sitting there.
* Other than lack of headwinds in the market in coming days in terms of data, I think market is close to key resistance levels.

**TODAY’S DATA LEDE/MACRO EVENTS:BOJ RATES DECISION - recall from previous reddit post, my expectation was for BOJ to hold rates despite speculation of possible hike.**

* Made no change to negative interest rate, holding benchmark at -0.1%Yield curve control unchanged.
* People had speculated that they would tighten which pumped up yen. Yen to now retrace those gains.
* BOJ spoke of “extremely high uncertainties” and said more needs to be seen to determine if “positive wage inflation cycle is in place”.
* Seeing gradual improvement in inflation but still not in a position to be sufficiently confident.
* Didn’t remove the rhetoric about “won’t hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary”. Thats quite dovish

**ANALYSIS:**BEFORE SPECULATION THAT BOJ WOULD TIGHTEN, USDJPY WAS TRADING AT 147.22JXY was trading at 68.Probably needs to retrace close to back to this.As Yen falls, Japanese equities going to become cheaper, so Nikkei will likely pump for few days now.

&#x200B;

**AUSTRALIA RBA MINUTES - For meeting where RBA went back to pausing after hiking again last month.**

* Board considered whether to raise rates by 25 bps or to keep steady. Decided on pause.
* Will continue to analyse the data to determine future policy.
* Some encouraging signs on inflation that need to continue.

**ANALYSIS**:Not much to these comments to be honest. Continued data driven rhetoric.**US** 

**BUILDING PERMITS AND HOUSING STARTS DATA COMING.**

**———— FX ——————**

* Yen lower, propping up USDJPY. USDJPY was trading at 147 before speculation of tightening. Since that didn’t materialise, USDJPY needs to retrace.
* Money rotating out of yen into other currencies like AUD, GBP etc
* Note Risk reversal on dollar index has touched lowest since 2020, and options pointing to substantial drop in USD. This would support equity markets.
* Note: Dollar and US equities are most inversely correlated since May - Can watch for some correction there.

**———— OPTIONS —————**

* 4800 remains sticky strike
* Record Call skew - Bullish.
* Single Digit implied Vol
* CTAs moving supporting on Brent Crude now - algorithmic strategies supporting oil

**——— MARKETS OVERVIEW ———**

* Markets: Flat as you would expect in premarket when they are trading at all time highs and there’s little macro catalysts to drive them notably higher right now.
* NIKKEI: Japanese stocks pumping after ultra easy monetary policy maintained for foreseeable future. Makes yen lower and Japanese equities cheaper
* GER40:Majority of sectors slightly green.
* HKG50: NOTE: I’m holding positions in the HKG50. I think it’s undervalued and people will rotate from US equities into HKG at some point.
* OIL: Flat this morning after pushing yday, although it did pare those gains when US said they will help to safeguard Red Sea vessels. Launched a task force. This reduces risk premium and made oil fall again.Yields: Flat, slightly lower

**——— INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ———**

* PIMCO SAYS THEY THINK UK WONT ACHIEVE SOFT LANDING. Said they are betting against GBP. Said UK consumers feeling brunt of interest rates more than US as less on 30 year fixed mortgages.
* MS’s MIKE WILSON SAYS US EQUITIES HAVE GREEN LIGHT TO MOVE HIGHER. - Another Bear capitulates. To be honest, I see this as a sign of market topping out too.
* GOLDMAN releases paper saying UST yields are higher in short term, but near historical averages. Bullsh\*t report really. They’re high, lets be real. Highest since 2005.
* GOLDMAN’s SENTIMENT INDICATOR TICKED UP TO 1.1. Points to stretched equity positioning. Due a correction.

**——— Company Specific ————**

* SEDG - Downgraded at Piper Snalder to neutral, price target at 105 (which is 15% above spot)
* RUN - Piper Sandler upgraded to overweight, raising price target to 31 , 72% above spot. Because RUN is more sensitive to cutting rates

Wont be buying it at these prices.I just read a short overview with summary that aerospace product demand was strong, and acquisitions helped to fuel their growth. Without acquisitions, still 12% organic sales growth though. So strong performance.

2023-12-20 05:31:43,TearRepresentative56,20/12 I'm a professional trader and these are some of my notes from premarket.,"**I want to start this post by clarifying some of my comments in yesterdays post, and responding to some of the user comments there.**

* When I said the market looks like it can be topping out, I am in no way saying I am a bear, nor am I saying I am short on the market. This is the US stock market. Obviously, in the long run, it is ultimately going to go up, and break highs. To clarify, I am still long the market. What I was saying was that barring a catalyst, which it doesn’t appear there is in the near term, I do not see a sharp move higher. I am not saying the market cannot move 0.4% higher etc day to day. It can, especially when there is nothing on the economic calendar in way of headwinds. The market is moving on optimism and can continue to move in the direction it is, especially when VIX is so suppressed. What I am saying is that if you look at the economic calendar, there’s not much this side of the new year to help push it higher forcefully.Instead, when you look at certain factors which I will break down here, it seems likely there will be some short term correction, before it again moves higher.Firstly, Mag 7 trading near resistance, which it will have to break. E.g. NVDA rejected at 500. AAPL rejected at 200. Obviously a news story can break these resistances, but trading right against them, makes it more likely for them to come down than go up.Same can be said for indices, with SPX just below all time highs, which will probably act as a resistance.
* Secondly, look at market breadth. More than 90% of stocks are trading above their 50 day Moving average. This makes sense to be honest, when you consider the rate cut optimism. But at the same time, if you look at the last 3 instances that this has happened, in each of them, the market has done short term corrections. The last time that it was able to reach a level where market breadth was at 90% and still move higher was in 2021. To be honest, I do not see enough similarities in the economic picture today to in 2021 to suggest this will happen again now. Interest rates are much higher, economic growth is slowing, consumer is holding up but there’s still uncertainty as to how long it can.
* For this reason, I see it as more likely than not that there will be short term correction before it moves higher again.
* I am still long the market. We operate a long only fund, so we never short. What we do do, is fluctuate our cash position to reflect the headwinds and tailwinds in the market, or you can say, the risk/reward in the market. Right now, I have trimmed my positions, and have closed my swing trades/active trades. I still have my passive positions all running. To this end, if the market moves higher for whatever reason, and I am proved wrong, I am happy, because my passive positions are doing well. If it price corrects, I am also happy as I can put my swing trades back in and utilise my cash position. This is what trading is all about in our strategy, using the cash position to hedge ourselves such that we benefit if the market goes up, or comes down.
* *I will now continue with the normal posts:*

**What happened yesterday, and some of my trades from yesterday:**

* Was off the desk yesterday, due to family bereavement.
* From what I can see, market continued to push higher from open. SPX is now 0.6% below all time high, whilst DJI and Nasdaq closed at all time high.Dollar was lower, whilst bond yields were flat.
* Only order I placed was for a small day trade in ARRY, entering at 18, for 2.6% gain, after its rating was cut by analyst.
* My sell order on short term trade in AVAV also executed at 130.

&#x200B;

* ***Because I was off the desk yesterday specifically, I will insert a section here on general market conditions, for those who want a bit of a summary, those who don’t can skip.***
* Market breadth continues to increase. The QQQ Equal weight, which negates the heavy weighting of the Mag 7, has moved from 52 week low to 52 week high across last month and a half.40% of stocks on the S&P are now above 70 RSI
* Goldman Sachs custom indices of unprofitable and heavily shorted stocks up 12% in last week, which tells you people are short covering and continuing to move into those stocks which have potential to run up with rate cuts.
* Discretionary stocks now at their highest level of outperformance vs Staples since January 2022.
* Put interest still very low, traders are chasing not hedging.

**————— EARNINGS ————**

* FEDEX earnings: Was trading at 52 week highs going into the print, up around 20% from last earnings, which puts pressure on the earnings being good.
* EPS of 3.99 missed estimates by 5%Revenue of 22.2b was down 3% yoy, and missed estimates by 1%Express Revenue still not picked up in last 4 quarters.
* Continues to see less shipments. Package volume down YOY. Perhaps less benefit from the UPS strikes than expected. Bit disappointing.Continuing on efficiency and cost reduction program (DRIVE). Cost reductions of $1.8bTo this end, cost per packaging declined 2%, due to lower line haul expense, and better last mile productivity.Demand remains uncertainBuybacks on stock of $1b in FY 2024
* Guidance:Cut full year revenue guidance - to fall single digit %, vs previous outlook of flatEPS guidance fell short at 17.75 at midpoint, miss consensus by 3%
* Conclusion:Yes margins expanded on lower revenues to help bottom line, but operating margin still fell short of expectations. Package volume decline showed limited benefit from UPS strikesNot enough has improved at all to justify how high it is trading.
* Overall, 5/10. Not terrible, but not good enough vs where its trading. Actually cut full year guidance, vs last quarter, when stock price is 20% higher.

**————— DATA LEDE —————**

* **JAPANESE BALANCE OF TRADE DATA -** Imports fell more than expected, whilst exports were more or less flat.
* This in theory should prop up the Yen as less imports means less selling of JPY. Seems to align with when Yen started going up last night, although the move is partly price correction from yesterday’s drop.
* **UK CPI (Nov) -** As noted in my Sunday post, I expected it to come in soft in line with US, and other European peers. GBP to fall slightly.
* This proved correct, as it came in well below expectations at 3.9% vs 4.4% expected.Core also fell to 5.1% vs 5.6% expected. Lowest core reading and headline reading in more than 2 years.
* MOM move was deflationary.
* This result is good for UK economy. Whilst Bailey at last meeting was signalling higher for longer, and UK and US situations are different, this datapoint shows that UK are starting to catch US up on inflation fighting front. May see rate cuts sooner than expected in UK.GBP falls on this, as it signals BOE can maybe move more dovish than before.
* **US - Consumer Confidence (Dec)** \- After market open, so hold early trading in anticipation of this.
* **US - 20 year bond auction**. Can move bond yields which can influence markets. Likely will see decent demand which will keep bond yields lower.

**———— FOREX ————**

* GBP moves lower on soft inflation numbers, which suggests BOE may be able to be more dovish than first thought.
* Yen doing some price correction after yesterday’s move lower. Also moving higher as Japan plans to issue more government bonds in 2024, increased demand for Yen.EUR lower slightly, in sentiment with GBP
* Note: Am holding GBPUSD as I believe that the BOE will hold rates higher than the Fed. Today’s inflation surprise does bring that into question a bit, but still think BOE will be more hawkish than Fed. I had trimmed a tiny bit ahead of the inflation print, so will put that back in soon.

**——— MARKETS —————**

* DJI hit new all time highs in premarket again, near 37,600 then pared gain as European markets sold off after open.
* SPX and NASDAQ similar story. Mostly flat in premarket. We expect this to continue, as barely any news catalysts around, VIX is suppressed, and GEX is very high which tells us volatility will be lower.
* GERMAN market quite flat, rejected at 16,800 today.
* UK at 3 month high following inflation data which fuelled rate cut bets.
* NIKKEI higher again on dovish BOJ yesterday as they signal ultra easy monetary to continue
* HKG50 opened higher, around 16,750 then sold off the gains, down 0.77%
* Oil moving higher by 1% in premarket. Continues higher on Red Sea complications. According to the downtrend I have drawn, which I think it will eventually break to the upside, oil is now close to the top of the downtrend, and may on a technical analysis basis do some correction here. My near term price target for oil overall is 80 though.
* Bond yields slightly lower in premarket today, which can support equities. But it’s only marginally lower so likely to have no impact.  10y lowest since July

**————— OPTIONS ————**

* GEX continues to grow - which lowers volatility4800 still sticky strike. 0dte tells us this is likely to be the max range today.HVL at 4645, 2.3% below spot.

**————  INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ————**

* Didn’t read too much as was off the desk yesterday. Here’s what I did read.
* DataTrek review 30 day rolling correlations of Daily returns on SPX vs individual large cap sectors, to suggest that the current rally has around 1-2 weeks left to run. They suggested that past that, market optimism would have pushed too far too fast.
* Bank of America’s fund manger survey yesterday showed equities saw largest inflow since October 2022. Tech saw the biggest inflows, industrials saw the biggest outflows. Dont; take too much notice of this inflows/outflows news. Ultimately, Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 9 straight days of gains.
* Bank of America also put out a piece saying that although credit card delinquencies have risen sharply over the last year, households on average remain flush with liquid assets. This is something we knew as Black Friday sales showed increase in Buy now pay later.
* Societe Generale: Market finds it easier to price monetary policy impact (rate cuts) than impact of inflation trends on margins. Last year, they misplaced hikes, vs impact of inflation on profits. For 2024, could be the other way around. AKA they are saying markets are probably pricing too much cuts.
* Unicredit - “Current enthusiasm seems somewhat exaggerated from short term perspective, and setback is highly likely”. Positives are priced in.

**——MAG 7 NEWS ( CAN MOVE MARKETS) ——**

* Generally flat, so the headlines outlined below are not considered big enough to have a market moving impact.
* **AAPL** \- financial impact of the smartphone ban not likely to be as severe as some first thought. Dan Ives estimates it to be about a $400m impact to sales over Holiday period. Is a drop vs their revenue.
* **GOOGL** \- plans to reorganise a big part of its 30,000 person ad sales unit.
* **TESLA** \- Reuters report that Tesla blamed drivers for failure of parts it knew were defective.
* **TSLA** \- VW has signed an agreement with Tesla to adopt North American Charging standard from 2025.
* **TESLA** \- will skip yearly media based employee stock awards
* **TESLA** \- Analysts at JL Warren Capital say that Tesla cut their prices for their EV cars in China by more than BYD did for its flagship car. Potentially more margin risk for Tesla.
* **META** \- CEO Zuckerberg just sold another chunk of FB shares. Has sold $320m in shares in last few days

**——— COMPANY SPECIFIC —————**

* **BABA** \- CEO Eddie Wu will lead Taaobao and T-Mall business in latest reshuffle
* **LUV** \- Southwest and Pilots union reach labour deal.
* **XPEV** \- BABA slashes their stake in Xpeng for 2nd time this month
* **NIO** and **Li** moving in sentiment with Xpeng. Chinese stocks generally all lower.
* **UPS** lower in sympathy with FEDEX earnings
* **CHH** \- pushing ahead on regulatory process for Wyndham takeover
* **DOCU** \- Wells Fargo downgrades to underweight
* **Lowe’s** \- cut to hold from buy by Stifel
* **S** \- Wells Fargo keeps hold rating on S
* **ENS** moving higher on earnings after they raised their Q3 profit outlook (need to read this report in full later)
* **TENB** \- higher on Buy rating by Wells Fargo
* **Oil** stocks generally higher on Oil prices being up 1%
* THERE WILL BE MORE COMPANY SPECIFIC NEWS NEARER THE MARKET OPEN. THIS WAS WRITTEN A COUPLE OF HOURS BEFORE

**————— OTHER HEADLINES ———**

* AFTER CPI DATA, UK INTEREST RATE SWAPS NOW PRICE 140bps of easing vs 117bps before CPI. Now markets beginning to price a cut by March.
* GOOLSBEE COMMENTS AFTER MARKET:Cautioned against euphoria in markets.Inflation will determine easing.What market is pricing won’t influence the Fed
* BOSTIC yday reiterated that the Fed won’t wait till 2% inflation to start cuts. Said he expects 2 cuts in 2024.
* MORE ECB OFFICIALS CAUTION ON INVESTORS BETTING ON RATE CUTS. This time it was ECB’s Nagel, who said “be careful, others have miscalculated before”
* FRANCE SEE EASING INFLATION EXPECTATIONS, GOOD FOR EUROZONE.
* GERMAN 10Y BONDS FALL BELOW 2% FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH. This on Rate cut hope for ECB. This has been supporting the GER40 to all time highs.
* South Korea C BANK CHIEF SAYS MARKETS ARE OVERREACTING TO POWELL’s DOVISH COMMENTS.  Market will ignore this commentary anyway. His opinion is worth less than Fed officials who have been saying a similar thing and Markets have been happily ignoring them too.
* COLORADO Supreme Court BAN TRUMP FROM APPEARING ON NEXT YEARS ELECTION STATE BALLOTS. Trump team will appeal. Vote was made by entirely democratically appointed Supreme Court.
* MAERSK say Red Sea shipping disruptions can add 2-4 weeks of delays

2023-12-22 13:09:39,Queasy_Deal_1857,How I Trade (Merry Christmas)," 

**Dear Traders,**

This piece of work is my way of giving back after everything I learned from other traders over the years. I'm a full-time trader and have nothing to sell. 

EDIT: I can’t answer the comments because I have no karma point (I’m new to Reddit)

**If you enjoy this post, I have a free blog with more than 160 articles about scalping, trade reviews, backtesting and more. It’s called The Statistical Edge on Substack (see profile).**

**Merry Christmas.**

I will, for obvious reasons, not share my scalping strategies. However, my goal is that by the end of this article, you’ll get the following takeaways:

* A better understanding of what being a scalper means;
* A systematic framework to approach the market;
* Tools to read and exploit your P\&L;
* New ideas to start building measurable trading strategies;
* Tools to identify volatile days to avoid losing it all;
* Tips to understand how your risk impacts the evolution of your trading capital;
* Actionable ideas to incorporate programming into your trading arsenal (don’t be afraid!!)

It’s quite a heavy schedule, so I’d suggest you don’t read it in one go. The more we advance in this guide, the more technical it’ll get. Take your time, take notes when something speaks to you, and see how to implement it in your daily trading life. This article took me hours to write and is basically a summary of my last ten years of trading journey, full of mistakes, pain, tears, hope, joy, introspection… I do believe it made me a better person, and I hope people realize the chance they have to be able to go for such a career in today’s world. Trading is my passion. Most days, when I close my eyes, I see candlesticks. During the weekend, I can’t wait for markets to open again. A wise man once said, “Never give up on something you can’t go a day without thinking”.

**Caveat: None of this is financial advice. I write out of passion, and you are responsible for your actions.**

# A better understanding of what being a scalper means

## Become a Samurai and scale-up

Being a scalper means catching small moves, multiple times during the day, with a tight risk. It also means, leaving a TON on the table. Being a scalper is a philosophy. It’s a choice of life. I see it as being a samurai. To survive, you need to execute the perfect gesture, on every single trade. Day after day. Week after week. Month after month. Year after year. You have to practice every day, be a humble student of the market, and master your emotion. Scalping is probably the most frustrating type of trading that exists. If you’re wrong, you’ll take an instant loss. If you’re right, and you hit your take profit of +20-40ticks, you might see prices going 400-800 ticks in your original direction, but you won’t be in that train anymore. 

As a scalper, you need to be in absolute control of your body and mind, at any time. You profit from micro edges you have against the market. There’s no place for hard feelings. If you let the frustration take over, you’ll be soon gone.

## What is scalping (to me)?

>My definition of scalping is pretty easy, get in and get out of your trade in seconds, sometimes a few minutes, but no more. I don’t do scaling, or leave runners. I like to go with my full size and take my win or my loss.

 

>To me, the beauty of scalping is that you get instant feedback from the market. You enter, and a few seconds after, you know if you were right or not.

This is crucial to me because it allows me to refine my strategy over and over whereas if I was a day trader or a swing trader, it would take me so much more time to gather enough trades history to see if what I’m doing is profitable or not.

**The only inconvenience with scalping is that most people tend to overtrade. A year ago, I was doing more than 100 trades a day. I was exhausted by the end of the week and it was too many trades to review, so I wasn’t making any progress.**

I list below my dos and don’t of scalping.

 

### Dos

* Extensively prepare your session, and identify areas that have a high probability of rejections. The worst thing you want is entering a trade and missing the bigger picture, which will lead to your stop loss being hit in seconds.
* Have a tight stop loss. You can have a positive risk-reward ratio scalping, and I highly recommend it.
* **Have a clear setup and trade it over and over.**
* Review your scalps at least on a weekly basis.

### Don’t

* Take too many trades. You’ll get lost and won’t even remember what your primary strategy is.
* Have tons of indicators. Keep your chart clean, you’ll thank me later.
* Go for home runs. Scalping is about compounding.
* Have a sub-1 risk-reward ratio. I know we discussed it right above, but it’s essential to your survival.

If you can put your ego on the side, have only a short amount of time to allocate to trading every day, and are a technical person, you might want to give a try to scalping.

# A systematic framework to approach the market

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rw9h7erzhw7c1.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=aca91b1d4d749173a8c5f94a00eece5945dca4d9

## Say your goodbyes to laziness

If you want to become successful, and we all have our own definition of successful, there’s no secret path. You’ll not only have to put in the hours, but you’ll also need to have a systematic approach to the market. An approach that you can repeat, day after day. An approach that you can measure, day after day. This is critical because you want to gather as many data points as possible to see where are your strengths and weaknesses.

>In trading, like in any competitive field, you’ll need to elevate yourself to new highs every single day. There’s no place for laziness, contemplation, or ego (yes I talk about ego a lot because you need to get rid of it). I’m not a basketball fan at all, but this guy is an aspiration. Working harder than anyone else, even when he was at the top. Working hard as he’s only comparing himself to himself. There’s no limit. Same in trading. A year from now, you could be losing a trader or a winning trader. If you want to give yourself a chance, you’ll have to work your ass as you’ve never done before. Sacrifice anything without excepting anything in return. You have to love the game, not the money.

## What does a systematic approach to trading looks like?

It will be different for everyone, but I believe there are some constants.

## Market preparation

It all starts the day before. You want to be ready before the next trading session starts.

Below is what I use during my trading session.

* I trade with two charts: 10 ticks and 40 ticks range charts.
* I use Volume Profile, deltas per price, volume, VWAP, and VWAP bands.
* That’s all.

However, during my preparation time, I use other timeframes. I always start with higher timeframes, especially during times when we enter new prices territories (or unseen for a long time). If we’re evolving in a range for a few days/weeks/months, it’s easier because we already know the key levels, and to me, less preparation is required.

However, when we keep making new highs or new lows on the daily and higher timeframes, it’s critical to spend more time analyzing the previous days where prices were evolving at these levels.

I like to look at the following:

* Quarterly/yearly closes;
* Daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly highs and lows;
* Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly VWAP last level;
* Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly Point Of Control (POC), Low Volume Nodes (LVN), and High Volume Nodes (HVN);
* Previous day’s open/high/low/close/30min opening range/VWAP close/POC/LVN/HVN.

This might take some time to have set up on your charts, but it’s worth it. I’d much rather have these key levels than any other indicators. Analyzing the market’s reaction when prices hit these levels will give you key insights into where the market wants to go.

You might not see it directly, and that’s why you need practice time. Eventually, it’ll become second nature during your trading session to analyze quickly and take action accordingly.

>**Practice until it’s perfect.**

## Morning ritual

I’ve already shared that on Twitter, but I have a very strict ritual regarding my morning routine. I like to tick as many boxes as I can on my checklist. If there are more than two boxes unticked, I simply don’t trade.

There’s enough money to be made during days where you have a defined edge, so don’t feel bad about it, and don’t let your ego goes in your way toward success.

Then, I take my coffee, open the charts, and look at the overnight action. If any significant action, I can reassess the key levels I drew the night before.

Now, it’s time to trade.

## Trading time

If you’re an aspiring trader, chances are that you’re still stuck in a 9-5. If that’s the case, your screen time is very limited. I think the biggest mistake beginners do is to trade from their phones.

I’ve been guilty of that for years. What a waste of time… and money! Do you seriously think you can outsmart hedge fund algorithms, experienced retail traders, by trading on your phone when your boss gives you a few minutes of freedom throughout the day? I’ll save you some time, it’s not gonna work.

You need to find a window in your day that is dedicated to trading and only trading. It can be as little as 45min a day. If it means you need to wake up at 4 am, then do it. Everything has a cost.

The benefits are multiple. I’ve listed mine below:

* I’m in a deep **focus mode** trading from 6 am to 7 am every single morning';
* I’m **really excited to wake up** because I know the first hour of the day is investing in my future life;
* I am more **comfortable** with the market I trade because it moves in a specific way during pre-market;
* **I can’t overtrade**. Once the session is done, I move on and go to my work.

The latter point is maybe the most crucial reason for my recent ‘success’.

## Journaling

Hands down my favorite time of the day. It’s peaceful, the job has been done, win or loss. Now is the time to look back at the choices you made during the day, and see how well you executed the plan you had, and the strategy you built.

Here are some of the questions I ask myself, and what I note in my notebook:

* Have I only traded setups that I know are A+ setups (e.g., proven profitably from my backtests)?
* Have I been emotional at any point during the day?
* Have I waited at least five minutes after a losing trade (the time I need to cool down and don’t make big mistakes)?
* Have I felt in line with the market today?

At the beginning of my journey, I had more questions on my list, like:

* Have I respected my max loss?
* Have I not traded during the market opening?
* Have I not let anyone’s else view skew my trading?

They are now gone from my list as it has become second nature, but you might want to have these in yours if you’re starting. You are the one who knows your strengths and weaknesses, so build a list of questions to rate your own trading, day after day.

By trading only one hour a day with one system, you should not have too many trades taken. This will immensely help you in that reviewing process.

Analyze each trade, and look at the parameters that made you enter and exit that trade. See how you executed the trade against the plan, and draw your conclusions. Then, when the next day comes, you know exactly what you need to improve.

Maybe you closed too early, maybe you entered a bit too late because you were scared.

>Repeat that process every day for a month, and I’ll promise you that you’ll see the difference.

## (Bonus) Talking to someone

The best thing is to have someone to talk to about your trading. Let’s face it, it’s quite difficult to have close people to talk to about trading. This is a pretty uncommon career path, and most people see it as gambling. I’m lucky I have my partner who is absolutely amazing and listens to me every single day about how my trading day went. With Twitter, I’m sure you’ll be able to find someone to talk to. My DMs are also always open if you need someone to talk to (However, I’ll answer when I want. I choose to trade to be free, not to have obligations). But yeah, don’t be scared. Ask people for help, you’ll be surprised by all the positive answers you’ll get, and the connections you’ll build. 

# Tools to read and exploit your P&L

If you don’t know what MAE, MFE, PF… mean, then you’re at the right place.

**At the end of this section, you’ll be able to analyze your own P&L and improve your trading results.**

### Trading is like running a company

All companies have a Balance Sheet and a Profit & Loss (‘P&L’). When you’re a trader, it’s no different. The cost of doing business as a trader will be your losses, commission, and fees (A). Your gross revenue will be your winning trades (B).

Your net profits will be (B) - (A).

But there’s more than that.

 A P&L statement can be intimidating at first, but I will explain each line of it so you can do it too. 

# New ideas to start building measurable trading strategies

I’m a firm believer that your exit is more important than your entry. I know a few traders that challenge themselves by doing trading sessions with an algorithm that takes random entries, and then it’s up to the trader to close the trader. These are exceptional scalpers, but I guarantee you that end up their scalping session in the green much more often than in the red, with random entries.

This section will be broken down into two parts:

1. How to create a simple framework;
2. How to derive a simple strategy from the framework.

We will focus on building a framework around VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) for the following reasons:

* It’s widely used across the trading industry;
* It’s a **consistent** approach to trading. Every day, VWAP will be here. You want something consistent to be able to measure your success and failures, in order to learn from them.

I apply that framework every single weekend during my review sessions.

**Sunday/Monday**

>Drop at the open followed by a rally during London's session. NY opened at the high of the day and prices saw a continuous nuke all day. VWAP was never strong support and prices failed to reach it again after it broke. Prices ended well below VWAP at end of the day.

&#x200B;

**Tuesday**

>Consolidation around VWAP before an impressive run through new highs of the day. Reactions at VWAP were very interesting and left clues for the rest of the day. Prices end the day at around VWAP and POC.

**Wednesday**

>The most interesting day. Tuesday showed strength through VWAP's reaction. Wednesday was a straight day up through all 3 sessions. A day to study!!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3xh90nwriw7c1.png?width=1687&format=png&auto=webp&s=05805e81014cefffd8d72c87172fd420277ac99b

**Thursday**

>After the green dildo from the day before - look at Thursday's action. VWAP has defended every bounce with bears being in total control most of the day until the 4th assault at the end of the day. Prices closed at around VWAP. Very clean PA and lots of points to be made.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/487u0p0uiw7c1.png?width=1686&format=png&auto=webp&s=4acda87c5f1f14e25c8bc2a41d584f115364ff4c

**Friday**

>Second most interesting day. Clean breakout of VWAP then successful retest, maybe the cleanest setup of the week. At NY open VWAP was quickly lost + failed double top of London session indicating bear trend day.

https://preview.redd.it/efs1kwtviw7c1.png?width=1710&format=png&auto=webp&s=72bedee75dfe4f1c0385480633d76edc82a4efea

You can make a career out of VWAP only. Study this week's PA and the reactions through VWAP. Pull the triggers when it's a clean setup. One trade a day can be enough. 

# Tools to identify volatile days to avoid losing it all

Lately, the action has been “crazy” in the markets. People like to identify days where they don’t have an edge to crazy days. Usually, it’s massive trend days, up or down, doesn't matter. Every time the market close +/-2%, +/-3%, many people lose it all.

There are a few ways to know in advance if tomorrow will be a “crazy” day, namely:

* Did we have an inside day the prior day?
* What does the VIX look like?
* How about the fear/greed index?
* Building statistics sheets.

I’m gonna talk more about the latest point, and how to build statistics sheets, and I advise you to build similar statistics for every single scenario that might lead to “crazy” days.

## Building statistics spreadsheets

#### Distribution of daily returns since March 1995

##### The daily returns almost follow a normal distribution

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dflry471jw7c1.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6f5888c04d2d9f20d4cc64504adaff6c041e7b9

First, let’s try to measure what is considered an abnormal red day.

The above chart is a histogram representing the distribution of Nasdaq’s daily returns since March 1995. As one can see, this looks like a normal distribution.

*If you’re not familiar, a normal distribution is a mathematical type of continuous probability distribution. I would suggest you read more on Wikipedia, this will be useful, especially if you use the Volume Profile, to understand the concept of the Value Area.*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aef6v8r2jw7c1.png?width=865&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbeb977578d3ca5ba54661d33df389349c654bb7

*FYI - this is what a normal distribution looks like.*

#### What is considered a big red day?

##### Hello my friend Percentile

I have ranked every trading day on the Nasdaq since March 1995 and I’ve looked at the return of the 5% worst days. In other words, out of 100 trading days, what are the returns for the 5 worst days in that sample.

*For those of you who are interested, this is called the 0.05 percentile.*

It’s a very powerful function that allows you to quickly get a grasp of key thresholds in a series of numbers.

**Since 1995, a day that has a return below -2.78% (let’s round it to -3%) is considered in the 5% of the worst day.**

My first reaction looking at this is that -3% red days happen more often than what I would expect. 5 days out of 100 we have a -3% red day, or **once a month**.

**Key points from that table**

* The returns are skewed towards positive returns: the best days have higher absolute returns than the worst ones, and the median is also positive.
* 50% of the trading days since 1995 have a return at least equal to or above 0.05%.
* 2 days a year (on average) we see a -4.70% red day.
* 2 days a year (on average) we see a +5.03% red day.

I find it useful to have those statistics in my mind, especially during volatile times. It helps me keep the bigger picture and trade more rationally.

#### What happens after a -3% red day?

Ok so now that we’ve paved the foundations, let’s look at the market’s reaction after such days.

I’ve been looking at the returns of the day following trading days that close at least 2.78% in the red. And the results are quite interesting.

**Key statistics**

* 357 days out of 6735 we closed below -2.78% (or 5% of the time, ok no big news here that was expected, but it’s always good to double-check our results).
* **0.50%**. **This is the average daily return of the Nasdaq since March 1995 on a day following a -2.78% close or worst.**
* Since 2010, we don’t have as many -3% days as we used to have between 1998 and 2009. **The market has changed**, and that’s your job to do your homework to adapt and survive. It means that 10 years from now the market will probably be different from today. I personally like to update my personal statistics at least once a year.

*Now, does that means that one can just buy the dip at the close of a red day and come back the next day?*

Let’s look at this in more detail.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t79c4hu6jw7c1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=2337a811426bb0fd0a59d9100d64183a0a344f31

 

>I’ve gathered for you the details per year of each of these following days. Even though the average return is 0.5%, there is a bigger potential, on average, for being short.  
**-1.97% is the average low a day after a -2.78% red day. Sure, it then retraces and closes in the green, but I find it fascinating that the market still goes almost 2% lower FIRST.**

This is the type of statistics you want to build to know what to expect before the trading day starts.

## Building a risk framework to avoid losing it all

In this section, I’ll provide you with the framework that I’ve been using for the last few months, and that helped me gain consistency in my trading journey.

### KISS Concept

As a retail trader, I believe EVERY aspect of our trading should be kept SIMPLE. You may have heard the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid). We will never be able to process data as efficiently as Hedge Funds are doing, and we have to fight with different weapons.

From my trading strategies to my Risk Framework, I always apply the KISS concept.

### Weaknesses and Strengths

To build a successful trading Risk Framework, you need to know your weaknesses and strengths. I believe we have to learn to live with our weaknesses, making them as meaningless as possible, whilst getting the best out of our strengths.

A good exercise I suggest you do is **to list your top three strengths and weaknesses**. This will be used as the foundation for our Risk Framework.

For me, it looks something like this.

**Top 3 Weaknesses**

1. I’m too greedy;
2. I become too emotional when the volatility peaks; and
3. I can’t focus for more than 1 hour in a row.

**Top 3 Strengths**

1. I trust myself;
2. I happily admit when I’m wrong and learn from it; and
3. I’m passionate about trading.

From these points, we can now build our trading rules/Risk Framework, or as I like to call it ‘The Code’. I’m a big fan of the TV Show ‘Dexter’, where the main character has to live a life full of lies. The only way for him not to get caught and end up in jail is to follow The Code, *a set of rules* instructed by his father.

### The Code

From the above six bullet points, I built **The Code,** which I try to follow every trading day.

1. Greed - To avoid being too greedy and turning green days into red days, I now **have a target for each day**. When/if that target is hit, I close NinjaTrader.
2. Volatility - I underperform in volatile times because my P&L moves too quickly. To tackle that issue, I have **stopped trading the market open**.
3. Attention span - I trade 45min per day, every day, at the same time.
4. Trust - If there is no clear reason to exit a trade, I stay in it.
5. Low ego - Review my trades on a regular basis.
6. Passion - **Live to trade another day.**

These rules are simple, and easy to follow because *they make sense to me*. I know why I have to apply them.

Finally, don’t let extreme volatile days rethink your whole approach to trading. You just need to be more prepared.

# Tips to understand how your risk impacts the evolution of your trading capital

Beginner's Luck or Unlucky MF? or Why you'll fail in trading if you don't use the Law of Large Numbers A simple graphical explanation

https://preview.redd.it/clld4i9ejw7c1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e2c7bfbee676009374021160c49a54c2ce157b2

In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times.' Let's see what are your chances of going broke with a specific risk per trade and winrate setups. 

Example 1 'The crazy gambler' You start with $1000, risk 10% per trade, win 50% of the time and your winners equal your losers. If you do 100 trades with 10 different accounts, 6 will get blown (60%!!) even though this is not a losing strategy. 

https://preview.redd.it/jrdbrvuhjw7c1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=839582c50696bf493e73f59601080739b24f12a6

Example 2 'The wise gambler' Same as above but this time we're risking only 5% per trade. Only 1 account is blown this time. By dividing the risk by 2, we are reducing our chances of going broke by 6. Risk is not linear, and it's important to understand it. 

https://preview.redd.it/phusrnljjw7c1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecf9bcea1949b1e5eac7e8ca3815a22181a5dc74

Example 3 'The John Doe' Very common - No edge, losers are bigger than winners and you win c. 50% of the time. Your account will die slowly but surely. You don't want to be in this case. 

https://preview.redd.it/1v6pdrzkjw7c1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd09c2454e1ad52abd601b0719408ac1c78e04ca

Example 4 'The I have an edge but I gamble' Proven statistical edge but betting 20% of the capital per trade. You'll go broke 3 times out of 10! That's a shame because you could have made a lot of $ respecting better risk management. 

https://preview.redd.it/xh5516mnjw7c1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc2cd4b955b6e02a6d476e45b9c68c4eb700b1aa

Example 5 'I have an edge and I risk 10% per trade' This time, no account is blown after 500 trades on 10 different accounts. You're in profit every time. See the difference? 

https://preview.redd.it/2jfdj9opjw7c1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=6166b07462ecd8aa4d424fe35311d068add90d0c

Example 6 - 'The Holy Grail' 60% winrate 5% risk per trade Winners = losers After 500 trades, on 10 different accounts, you MADE it. On average, you have multiplied your account by 5.8. Congratulations, you understand why the risk you can take is correlated to your edge. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnz95xqrjw7c1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb354a054482135b61224ce672e40d08984e2cbf

Once again, it’s a lot of groundwork, but you need to understand these mechanics to understand why you can’t risk too much per trade, and how your winrate and risk-reward ratio influence the risk you can take. 

# Actionable ideas to incorporate programming into your trading arsenal (don’t be afraid!!)

I’ve been programming for years. I started in high school as a hobby learning C/C++, then Java for my first internship, before definitely switching to Python a few years ago. I’m a firm believer that anyone should incorporate some sort of programming into their trading to become a better trader.

* Building automated spreadsheet to gather broad statistics (like I explained above);
* Building scanners if you trade multiple underlying assets;
* Backtesting your trading ideas;
* Automating your entries;
* Automating your whole strategy.

You can use google sheets and the Yahoo Finance built-in API to start building a spreadsheet that gathers statistics.

If you’re using Ninja Trader, you can start using the Strategy Builder to start backtesting some ideas.

You’ll need to read some documentation, but you will have more insights and statistics for your trading. It can’t hurt. And it’s fun, I promise.

# Conclusion

Wherever you are in your life, it’s never too late to live your dreams.

&#x200B;

If you’ve made it thus far, congratulations, and thank you for taking the time to read my guide. I do this for free, as a way to give back to the community. I believe in positive karma.

The education on YouTube + tradezella has really helped me a lot and I find that he is pretty straight forward and easy to understand.

2024-01-11 20:16:04,PortCapital,"Full time options day trader, 10 years in market.............My #1 piece of advice separating profitable from unprofitable.....","&#x200B;

Ive been in markets now for almost 10 years, first 4 was gambling, year 4-8 was a roller coaster. Some success followed by chaos. My last 2 however things clicked. Shit got real.

My accounts equity curve now looks like a google spreadsheet wet dream. The type of one where you calculate a 10% daily return over a few months.

Ill never be one to brag about profits. Those who do online imo are likely trying to feed off your dreams and sell you an expensive lottery ticket. (their course).

What i wanna advise today that i truly believe makes difference between profit or not is work ethic.

This shit takes work. This shit takes dedication and structure. Ive slowly built up to this but it wasnt until i fully committed to it for EVERY trade last few years that i got to see consistent profit.

What kind of work? For starters the biggest impact you can make to your trading is

1. Learn how to scan for stocks in play. Its waste of time trading random stock or a few names every day...........Truth is most names do not move much besides the rare time they have news or a big technical pattern set up........focus on finding the few names that have big volume and clean movement for the day. If in a intra day range = no trade for me. Only want to trade directional movement.

2. Risk down.......I see way too many ppl ""yoloing"" 0dte or simply sizing too much for a trade. I dont care how good of a set up it is it should never take up more than 25% of your account. This is what i used when trading a small account but feel free to use less. Going over this especially on options is jst a recipe for disaster.  NEVER go ""all in"" ..this type of thinking is exactly what keeps people from ever succeeding.

3. proper trading is having detailed trades with detailed entries, stops and profit taking. If you dont have these you shouldnt be trading. Why are u watching this stock? why will you enter this stock? Where is the stop loss for this entry? When will you take profit?.....all of these steps need to be diligently planned out for consistency. 

4.  Review your trading. First you need to be able to find what stocks to trade, then you need to have precise set ups to trade these [stock](https://stocks.next/)s, and after that you gotta recap. 

After trading review your trades in detail. Review the trading day in detail. Did you trade the best stocks for your system? How did your set ups perform? What should you watch for tmr?......Journal and dive into this shit. Can you find better stocks? can u enter better? can u stop out or take profit better? This is a performance based job so treat it as such.

This is to give an idea on what should be done every day if you wanna succeed. Comes down to WORK and ALWAYS looking to improve.

My trading account equity curve since adapting this mindset.

2024-01-25 19:49:04,productism,"So, I found my strategy with a high probability success rate.","Just a backstory on why I had to find something that works for me. I had two funded accounts, which were doing very well. I loss both from over trading without getting any payouts. It forced me to find a setup I can use everyday with a high probability success rate.

This setup seems to be +80% so far. It's been backtested last year, and has had a high-probability success rate this month as well.

What I do:  
1 - I trade on the 5-Minute Chart  
2 - I wait for the Macro Time range 09:50 - 10:10 AM EST to finish.  
3 - Once the 10:10 candle completes, I wait for the long or short bias  
4 - Once there is a retracement to the level I want to enter, I place my order with a profit target of Target #1  
5 - No matter what, I set the stop loss and once my position is in the green I set a trail stop 1 tick above my break even to lock any profit.

When did this strategy not work for me:  
1 - If NYSE is closed (such as on MLK), since the volume was low and the trading day was half. It failed on NQ but ES hit its target  
2 - If there is divergence between NQ and ES, I tend to pick the stronger ticker towards the bias.  
3 - I would say, since I wait for an Optimal Trade Entry (such as a retracement / fib level, etc) I have made profit even though the targets did not hit. The reason is because I set the trailing stop once I am in profit.

When do I enter a position earlier:  
1 - If there is a high-probability setup that appears during the Macro Bullet's time range (09:50 - 10:10 AM EST), I will enter those all the time.

Here is a screenshot from today's ES and NQ.

2024-02-12 06:26:14,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is a complete report of everything I read and analysed from premarket 02/12 to inform your trading today.,"**Analysis**:

* Today looks like a relatively light day in terms of macro releases and news. This is pretty much reflected in how flat premarket has been, around the levels it closed on Friday. 
* Let’s get into positioning then: 
* &#x200B;
* On SPX, the call interest is surging on SPX at 5050 and 5100, following the break of 5000 on Friday. The market looks like it is extending the bets on the market going higher from here. The images below compare the option positioning on Thursday close vs Friday close. See a lot more developing over 5000.   
 
* [https://imgur.com/a/HiOeIpa](https://imgur.com/a/HiOeIpa)
* This chart shows all expirations. If we look at some near term expirations, we can see that the call resistance has rolled up to 5030. This is a bullish sign. We are not really seeing much activity here on the downside to suggest any worry of an immediate correction. 
* 5030 level looks like it could be a key level today, but watch the levels to watch section below  
  [https://imgur.com/a/XLxpVBl](https://imgur.com/a/XLxpVBl)   
   
 the Gex is very positive right now. We are quite far above the HVL. This tells us that mosts likely, since we are in such positive gamma, the volatility will be suppressed today. 
* Skew is actually pointing slightly lower, but it’s no big deal, it’s just because futures are flat. block flows are very strong, and continue to increase. 
* Traders are starting to hedge the market, buying OTM puts, but the positioning still bullish, just increasingly cautious.   
 
* If we look at QQQ then, we had SPX hit 5k on Friday, but the market is still watching to see QQQ hit 440. That is a VERY sticky strike. We see a LOT of call interest on it, and IV OI. I’d expect it to hit this week, particularly if some of the macro data supports it.  
 
* We can see the positioning in the images below:  
 
* [https://imgur.com/a/LyaRLVJ](https://imgur.com/a/LyaRLVJ)  
 
* Note that QQQ tracks Nasdaq (NDX), which is currently trading at 17,956. Watch 18k level. The market will probably face some resistance there and we will need to see stronger volume for it to break. 18k is also the Call resistance. So whilst you may watch QQQ, you should also be watching this level on NDX. 
* Look at one thing here: mag7 Skew. This is the skew but concentrated on just the Mag 7.
* Moving higher again, at ATH. Traders don’t expect any issues for the big firms. Expected to carry the market higher. 
* Let’s take a look at some FX ahead of the week:
* AS mentioned in the report yesterday, ahead of CPI, risk reversal in USD is pointing lower. Traders are not particularly concerned about the CPI and PPI and expect ti to come in soft or in line. 
* We can see this bearish divergence here, clearly. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/prrhrjB](https://imgur.com/a/prrhrjB)
* For individual currency pairs, EURUSD and GBPUSD, for both, risk reversal is pointing higher. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/NZXurdQ](https://imgur.com/a/NZXurdQ)
* A quick look at NVDa then, which is up again in premarket. 
* What we are seeing here is basically a continued squeeze. Skew points higher again, hits a new high. This comes as IV in OTM puts drop. BASically, bears keep trying to predict and short the pullback, but then as it moves higher, they continue to get squeezed and rush to cover their positions. This is moving NVDA higher in a parabolic way. If you are bearish on NVDA, it seems you need to just watch and wait rather than trying to guess the top. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/TiMQA2k](https://imgur.com/a/TiMQA2k) 

**Levels to watch: (plot these on your charting platform as it will help you to analyse intraday price action).**   
 

* SPX currently trading at 5025.
* One key level will be the 0dte Call resistance which is now at 5030. 
* Note the all expiration call resistance remains at 5000, which will create some support there. 
* Other key levels for gamma are 5050 and 5015. 
* My quant says the max trading range for today is 5059.
* I doubt we hit that high, probs get stoped around 5030-5035. Let’s see
* Quant says minimum of expected trading bound is 4994 ish. 
* QQQ:
* Like I said, watch 18k level on NDX. This translated to around 438.4 on QQQ
* Call resistance for QQQ is 440. I doubt we move higher than that today as there’s not much news. 
* Key gamma levels to watch are 435 and 437. 
* Quant says min of day trading range will be 433 and max of the day trading range is 441.   
 I think we trade well within that range, as traders don’t want to make big moves before CPI. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* Nothing particularly significant on the economic calendar for today. No big data releases. 
* We do have some fedspeak later, as Bowman speaks, as does Kashkari. 
* For the UK, Governor Bailey will be speaking. He probably reiterates the data driven approach for BoE and that its too early for cuts. After the last BoE meeting, markets trimmed bets on BOE rate cuts slightly, pricing 107 BPS in 2024, from 111 before.

**INSTIUTITIONAL RESEARCH:**

* An interesting piece here from Goldman Sachs: They have put out a note telling their clients to get out of parabolic tech. Said Everyone Is In The Same Trades And All-In”. Went ton to say that this is the Best Start Of The Year Ever For Momentum, But ""You Don't Want To Be On The Wrong Side During A Momentum Crash”.
* A quote from a Goldman Sachs paper, where they compare the state of the stock market today, to the 2000 Dot com bubble: “At this point, valuations at the top are no where near as frothy as they were at the height of the Dot Com Bubble. The 5 largest stocks traded at 43x Fwd PE in March ‘00, a 59% premium to the Mag 7’s current multiple of 27x.""  
 
* We see this demonstrated in the table below:
* [https://imgur.com/a/fUdSFMa](https://imgur.com/a/fUdSFMa) 
* Bank of America say that they can see potential for the outperformance of small cap this year. They said that the factors that are supportive of this in 2024, include bottoming profits, historically attractive valuations (29% discount to large), improving market breadth, a Fed cutting cycle and inflecting macro indicators that are correlated with relative performance.
* Global gold outflows continued in January, dragging Gold price lower, shows Bloomberg. 

**MARKETS:**

* SPX: Closed Friday at 5026. In premarket, been trading in such a narrow range. Basically flat. 
* NASDAQ: Trading flat at 17,965. Watch the technical level of 18k today. Market will be trying to break it, may temporarily intraday, but this is the key level to watch as will need significant volume for Nasdaq to close above it. 
* DJI: Flat in premarket at 37,650. 
* GER40: Has been trying to break 17k level. Got a big push at 9am when market opened, right up to the 17k level. 
* Hong Kong Market closed for national holiday. 
* Chinese market slightly higher, trading at 11,430
* OIL: Got rejected at 77 on Friday. Trading slightly lower today, at 76. OIL IS SLIGHTLY LOWER Mostly as price correction from last week, but also AS ISRAEL SAYS IT HAD CONCLUDED A SERIES OF STRIEKS IN SOUTHERN GAZA, somewhat easing concerns of supply risk. Strikes continue in Gaza though, as Gaza officials say airstrikes kill 67. 
* Bonds: Opened higher today, then moved lower.  

**FOREX:**

* JPY higher ahead of PPI later today. Risk reversal on JPY points lower. Traders are expecting that due to a hesitant BOJ to tighten, and no certainty on wage inflation, that JPY will underperform. 
* Dollar more or less stable right now, slightly higher, after got a bit of a push when European market opened. 
* EURUSD slightly lower, came to 1.08 then bounced down as found resistance and no big volume from the macro data to drive it higher. This was all technicals. 
* GBPUSD following lwoer.
* AUDUSD opened slightly lwoer, then moved higher. 
* Not much news driving FX movement this morning. Just usual price action. 
* NZD lower on comments from NZRB governor who said that inflation ate was still too high at 4.7%. Whilst hawkish, there was some repricing, NZD has been up recently on expectations of RBNZ to hike again.

2024-02-15 18:17:19,jesuswasntWh1te,PDF or Google Doc??,Hey I’ve seen a few comments from people saying they were reading through a PDF or something that another trader here put together. I think his name might be Harry or something? Can anyone point me in the direction of this document or know what I’m talking about
2024-02-21 06:31:19,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket 02/21,"**ANALYSIS:**

* Firstly, NVDA earnings are today. 
* Bloomberg is showing an 11% predicted volatility on earnings, as shown below. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/C1nuTr6](https://imgur.com/a/C1nuTr6)  
* NVDA is lower in premarket on continued profit taking, but we can notice a few things. Firstly, skew, which was pointing sharply lower has now reversed upwards, as IV in OTM calls increases. 680 was a key gamma level where traders tried to buy the dip from yesterday.   
 As we know earnigns are a risk. Earnigns when the stock is up 50% in the last quarter are an even bigger risk. We saw that in other earnings reports, like Google’s where good earnings were still punished based on valuation. 
* Bulls on NVDA are for the most part holding their positions.
* This is the net gex profile for NVDA, skewed mostly to calls still on all expirations. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/IlFyzTE](https://imgur.com/a/IlFyzTE) 
* On the 1 week to expirations, we can see more hedging for the earnigns. This clears up and the profile is again biased to calls when you look at monthly expirations. So traders hedge into earnings s that makes sense, but outlook still bullish. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/hzs6fu8](https://imgur.com/a/hzs6fu8) 
* Key levels for NVDA are:
* Call resistance at 700, although lots of calls on 750 too
* Put support is at 640
* Put support from 0dte options is at 650
* These will be key levels going into the earnigns print. 

——

* China points higher today as markets react to the cutting of 5 year rate yesterday. We noted on weekend that it seemed skew for Hong Kong was pointing higher and we could see calls building on 17k. It seems that traders are still expecting 17k to hit. 

A look at Oil:

* Spot price falls at the moment, as volatility continues as traders buy ATM puts to hedge for volatility.
* However, we can see from skew that there is a bullish divergence there on Brent. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/xtjaHfa](https://imgur.com/a/xtjaHfa) 
* Volatility continues due to the hedging and the evercahgning geopolitical landscape, as well as ever changing Fed expectations. 
* But overall, outlook still looks bullish. 

A look at BTC\\

* Looks like we can be seeing a local top here. IV in OTM calls is reducing, block trade flows also reduce. Skew points lower. May see some correction. 

A quick look at indices then:

* Volatility skew does point down as traders hedging with put options, but money flows from hedge funds hit new high yesterday. Funds are buying the dip, and not expecting it to last in medium term. A lot in the short term will depend on NVDA though. 
* Finally, if we look at Mag7 skew, we do see signs that market can continue to price correct. 
* We see Mag7 skew lower, which often leads the market. Traders are seeking some protection from the volatility in short term. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* KEY IS FOMC MINUTES WHICH IS RELEASED 2 HOURS BEFORE MARKET CLOSE. 
* Japan tankan business survey gives first negative reading on business sentiment since April 2023. 
* Japan Balance of Trade Numbers:
* Overall balance of trade was less negative than expected. 
* Exports grew more than expected up 12% YOY, ahead of expectations of 9.5%
* Imports fell more than expected, by 9.6% vs 8.4% expected.
* This means more exports and less imports, points to greater demand for JPY. Would expect JPY to rise on this. But JPY down on Japanese gov downgrades and business survey weakness. 
* Australia Wage Price index:FASTEST PACE OF RISE In 15 YEARS. 
* YOY comes 4.2% vs 4.1% forecast. Last quarter’s data revised up to 4.1% from 4%.
* QOQ comes 0.9% vs 0.9% forecast. 
* Hotter than expected wage data points to stickier service inflation and thus, a more hawkish RBA. 
* UK Record budget surplus for January:
* UK Chief secretary says that they still won’t speculate if tax cuts are affordable or not in the budget. 
* US mortgage demand numbers:
* Mortgage demand takes a hit, interest rates cross back over 7% on reduced rate cut expectations pushing up bond yields. 
* EU Consumer Confidence NUmbers:
* Later we have FOMC minutes - likely reveals more of what we know, continue to explain that we need to see more of the same data to be confident of cuts. Slight hawkish tone probably. 
* FED SPEAKERS: BOSTIC speaks, as does Bowman. 

**MARKETS:**

* SPX - yesterday, found support around 4955, before recovering back to 4977. Before Europe opened, was trading at 4972, dropped slightly on European open as FTSE100 sold off. 
* Nasdaq: Slightly lags SPX and DJI. This is due to the big sell off in PANW. Low of day yesterday was 17,400, before recovery to 17,550. Lower in premarket,. 
* DJI - Trading at around 38,500 in premarket, slightly down, at the low of the day from yesterday. 
* HKG market higher today on cutting of loan prime rate. Was up almost 4%, as high as 16,800, before paring some gain to 16,460. 
* China meanwhile is up 2% to 11,890. Key level here will be the 12k level, which it was rejected off of. 
* GER40: low of yday was 17,020. Trading quite flat. Today got a bit of a boost at open and is up 0.42% to 17062. This comes as we are seeing higher open interest on 17.5k
* UK market down 1%
* Gold higher again on softer dollar and Middle East geopolitics - 5th consecutive green day in a row. 
* OIL: down 0.8%. Little bit of correction here, as was trading 78.5 yesterday. Volatility is persistent but skew keeps higher, just with more hedging. 
* Bond yields slightly lower ahead of FOMC minutes later. 

**FOREX:**

* AUD was higher on hawkish wage data. 
* Dollar was lower into the FOMC minutes, pared slightly. 
* EURUSD and GBPUSD slightly lower back to 1.08.

2024-04-19 04:43:22,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is everything you need to know in premarket 19/04 after Israel retaliates against Iran.,"**OVERNIGHT GEOPOLITICS:**

* Israel launched 3 drones on Iran with a military base in the city of Isfahan the target. Nuclear site was near there. 
* No damage to nuclear site.
* Iran says they were able to destroy the 3 drones over Isfahan. 
* Israel apparently gave pre warning to the US that they would do this. 
* Senior Iranian official says no plans or immediate retaliation, Israel has already seen our reaction. That’s calming things down a bit. 
* Iran are signalling they will not retaliate. 
* IAEA criticises nuclear facility as ever being a target. 
* Shipping firms jump after Israel attack, on expected shipping supply problems which will boost freight rates

ANALYSIS: 

* Big reaction in after hours after Israel attacked in retaliation to Iran. In truth, there esponse was quite measured, and Iran is saying they aren’t planning a big retaliation. 
* Initially, we saw JPY and CHF get bid, along with Gold and oil. These are safe haven assets, thats why. Meanwhile, AUD, NZD, BTC and Equities all sold off as risk on assets. 
* The drop triggered CTA selling on futures, which led to a more exaggerated impact. Furthermore, we are in a scenario of Market illiquidity, buyback blackout, market depth very low. This makes the after hours response more exaggerated. 
* VIX jumped. 
* Now, we see the initial reaction almost entirely pared. Futures have recovered, but will be weighed by Netflix earnings. 
* Vix is selling off, and currency movement has normalised.
* Remember OPEX today on top which will drive volatility, particularly at open and at closing. 
* On oil, expect more choppiness as skew continues to point lower despite the geopolitics news overnight
* Skew on SPX is lower. Look, yes, SPX is selling off, but it still appears to be hedging. Institutions are buying dips, whilst hedging for downside with weekly vix calls. 
* Mag7 skew still points higher, and credit spreads are very low. 
* Institutions, from money flows, we can see, are not selling just because of the pullback. They are actually going more long.
* It’s just because of the lack of liquidity and VIX being elevated, market makers aren’t supporting the full recovery in SPX yet. 
* THis is still a bullish environment, just being rocked by persistent geopolitical news which is spiking vix, forcing market makers to remove liquidity. 
* Once geopolitical situation normalises, we will see vix lower and more likely a squeeze higher.
* Main risks to this thesis are earnings surprises by big firms, and also more geopolitical unrest. If Iran is right that they won’t retaliate big time to this attack, then probably we see the 2nd point not really materialise. 
* TSLA looks a bit dicey to me though. Semis can struggle a bit too if TSM continues lower as it doesnt yet look like traders are looking to jump in. Continued call selling. Maybe see drop to 125. 
* If we look at GOOGl, Skew points lower as we see so downward presusre persists into opex. 

DATA LEDE:

* Japanese Inflation ate, came in at 2.7%, in line with expectations. Slightly down from last months reading of 2.8%   
 Core came in at 2.6%, slightly down from last months 2.8%
* Overall, still maintaining BOJ’s target above 2%
* UK retail sales:
* YOY came in at 0.8% missing expectation of 1%. Better than -0.4% last month
* MOM was 0%, vs forecast of 0.3%
* Core retail sales came -0.3% MOM vs forecast of 0.3%
* Core retails ales YOY was 0.4% missing exp of 1%
* So slightly soft Retail sales , particularly on core retail sales. 
* Retail stocks in Europe then underperformed as Retail numbers came in soft. 

MARKETS:

* Futures slumped initially after Israel launched airstrikes on Iran in response to attack last week.
* This led SPX to be down 2% to 4930 initially, before initial impact was pared, and now SPX trades back at 5000. 
* NDX dropped more than 2% to the 17k level, before bouncing off and recovering back to 17399. 
* Dow Jones was down to below 37,300, before increasing again back to 37,665. 
* HKG50: Sold off to the 16k level, before recovering with the US markets. 
* Ger40: was lower overnight but push higher this morning means Ger40 nearly turns green. 
* Oil jumped initially back to 85, before paring the gains back to 82.5. SO now just marginally up. 
* Similar on Gold
* VIX - after the attack overnight, VIX jumped to 21 as markets sold off, but VIX has sold off the gain and is back at 19, which has fuelled the recovery in markets as market makers add liquidity back. 

FX:

* After Israel airstrikes on Iran in response to attack last week, we initially saw Yen and CHF jump as safe haven assets, whilst AUD and NZD dropped initially as they are risk on assets. 
* Now we see the initial impact pared, as both come back to being neutral 
* This coincides with the paring of losses on indices. 
* YEN - 76% of economists expect BOJ intervention to stop further weakening from 155.

We have learned that Reddit reviews make it to the top of google and Scott cannot remove these.

I was a member of Scott's 0DTE Option Trading Service and quickly found out that he is running a well oiled scam. He has about 350-400 people in his discord trading room and combined with another investing service makes over $1M a year from his sub's. He is running a Scam. He thrives on attracting new users to his room by creating YouTube videos blatantly lying about gains. Everyone wants to trade 0DTE and this brings people to his room. He routinely loses $20K plus on 0DTE NDX and SPX credit spreads. He will roll bad trades and when they get worse he will close them saying ""Let's reset that trade""

Anyone that challanges him gets berated or booted. He runs his room as a dictator. Scott is a masterful snake oil salesman, thief, and a thug.

Again I'm writing this to create visibility and trying to expose him for what he is. A thief and a Scammer!"

2024-05-18 16:19:00,Interesting_Wear_316,Unprofitable Trader here (Any profitable trader advice would help),"Hello all, I am a 20M and I have been trading on and off for two years now.

  
I should point out to start that my ""main"" job or profession is marketing/copywriting/sales. I usually work with coaches and optimize their ads/funnels/workflows/e.t.c. I have a few clients there but I just have a hunger to be a great trader as well because I see the potential and know the time freedom is much better.

  
The focus of my trading has been SPY. 95% of my trades will be naked calls/puts on spy 1dte or 0dte. 

  
I start off by depositing $100 into my account so I do not lose much.

  
My best run has been $650 from $100. I had 5 straight green trades and I was executing at a high level. %100 gainers for multiple days straight.

  
Now I am back to unprofitable and having to put $100 back into my account.

  
I did recently change my mind, I believe doing paper trading until I pinpoint and fix the issue is better for me.

  
I have only lost $500 of my money, the rest was house money off profits. ($1,500 in total)

  
I know that trading is hard and takes a while to master. I am committed because the benefits are huge (financial and time freedom)

  
But, I am also passionate about being a great trader. I want to be a genuinely skilled trader.

  
I want to share my strategy as well as where I think I am going wrong.

  
I use Positions of interest(liquidity, highs, lows, places where price jumped aggressively or fell aggressively), price action, volume, and order block level 2.

  
Once I go into a trade I always set the SL to -0.2 and TP to +0.6 or 0.5. 

  
I feel that my problem is consistency and finding myself searching for a reversal rather than following a trend.

  
For example, I took a few spy put positions this week and lost every trade because I have this thought in my mind since it is at a ATH that it has run out of gas. But in reality the market does what it wants. The algo just tries and equate buyers and sellers.

  
I also find myself having one trade ruin my port (poor risk management)(over confidence). I have a trade that I am supremely confident in start of bad and then I remove my SL and it ends up going to zero and I do not stop it.

  
I find myself believing that trading everyday at a set time is needed to make money. (10:15 am eastern usually)

  
I guess what I am looking for is maybe some tips and helpful advice.

  
I hope I gave enough context.

  
I would genuinely appreciate anything."

2024-06-16 04:10:13,What-Dreams,STOP Losing!!!,"""Once I learned how to stop losing, I started LEARNING how to win"" Not an exact quote by J. Livermore wrote something like that.

This is Grandpa. Trading is a reflection of your life. Are you disciplined in your life, practice good habits? Good 👍 it will carry over into your trading.

It is called STOP LOSS, not STOP WIN for a reason. Use it.

Be merciless in cutting your losses. Fast kill.
Set up an alert for a reversal or continuation of TREND. Move on.

Move on for a better trade.

I have a lot more to share but let's get this conversation going.

QUESTION:

For those of you who don't use a HARD STOP, why? I lose more with mental stops. Now, I just admit that I mis-read Price Action, get out, and keep an eye on a better re-entry.

What are the benefits of mental vs hard stops for you? Open minded, everyone has something that works for them.



Stay green, not red ♥️ 

Love you all,

Grandpa.


P.S. Cash is a position. 

EDIT:
Googled and found the exact quote from 

J. Livermore:

""There is nothing like losing all you have in the world for teaching you what not to do. And when you know what not to do in order not to lose money, you begin to learn what to do in order to win.""

I came very close to losing it ALL."

I can't afford tradezilla as i am a student, so i started journaling in a google doc, and i realized that i was making the same mistakes over and over again. But the journaling was still difficult, time consuming and monotonous.

So i started looking for ways to make it simpler, and so after a lot of research on this topic, i came to a conclusion that i need to make a notion template, there were already many templates out there but honestly all of them were ass, so i started building my own template. I took some ideas from tradezilla some from other templates and brainstormed some of my own, and some that i realized that i need in my journal while i was journaling my trades.

And finally after hours and hours and a few lines of code later. I made the perfect trade journal

Between 2015 and March 2018, this glitch allowed outside developers access to almost 500k (!!) users personal data.

And despite discovering this issues in March 2018, Google didn't inform anybody about that to avoid regulatory issues. Simply - they didn't want ""problems with regulators which can affect their reputation"" as they said.

Actually, I think that Google+ was over even back then, in precovid times, so, they didn't even have a chance to compete with any other platforms so it was kinda predetermined for them. And it's good that they are paying at least something due to this mess."

My Google-fu is fairly strong though and was surprised I didn’t see a simple answer to this. 

A lot of YouTube videos advise that if you are consistently profitable you should make your day trading endeavor into an LLC, but they give a nebulous range, if they give a range at all. Hell, some are unclear if you should even just make it an LLC from the start or not. Then there is even the idea that one should never bother making it an LLC. 

So, I’m turning to you guys and hoping to get the straight dope."

* **Kenvue** ($KVUE) leaped 14.68% after exceeding analyst earnings expectations in the second quarter, fueled by strong sales of its well-known products like Band-Aids and Tylenol.

# Is It Safe to Breathe Again, Investors?

If your inbox was flooded yesterday with anxious messages from friends fretting over their stock portfolios or colleagues worried about their 401(k)s, you weren’t the only one.

# Is the Storm Over?

Monday's market madness had investors around the globe in a frenzy, thanks to a perfect storm of economic jitters. The chaos started with unsettling employment data hinting that the Fed’s efforts to cool the economy might be working too well. Add to that a massive unwind of a popular carry trade in Japan and some AI-related profit-taking, and you had a recipe for a sea of red in the markets.

But just as quickly as the losses came, they started to fade. Tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft, which were among the biggest losers yesterday, have already bounced back into positive territory.

# Staying Steady in Unsteady Times

So, is the storm over? Not so fast. While yesterday's selloff seemed more about fear than fundamentals, the broader economic landscape remains shaky. The Fed hasn’t budged on interest rates yet, despite growing speculation that they’ll roll out a hefty rate cut in September to calm things down.

Wall Street pros are warning that we’re likely in for more turbulence before any rate cuts materialize. And though a half-point cut seems to be the consensus, these are the same folks who predicted six rate cuts at the start of the year—so take their forecasts with a grain of salt.

# The Takeaway?

Don’t let market swings scare you into cashing out. Analysts stress that volatility is no reason to hit the eject button, especially after the strong gains we've seen this year. A little bumpiness is par for the course.

And if we’re not at the market’s bottom yet, this might just be the chance to buy into sectors like AI, which have been sky-high in recent months.

In short, hang tight and keep your cool.There are plenty of other things to lose sleep over, like whether your favorite streaming service is about to hike prices again or why that meme stock you bought for fun is suddenly your biggest holding.

# Market Movements

* Tesla ($TSLA) is set to fix 1.7 million vehicles in China, according to the Market Regulator.
* Uber ($UBER) reported a 16% YoY revenue increase in Q2, surpassing analysts' estimates.
* Airbnb ($ABNB) warned of a potential slowdown in U.S. demand, even though it saw revenue growth in Q2.
* Elon Musk has sued OpenAI and Sam Altman, accusing them of straying from the organization’s mission to develop AI that benefits humanity. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Musk previously filed and then dropped a similar lawsuit.
* Groq, a startup producing chips to power AI models, raised $640M in a new funding round, bringing its total to over $1B with a $2.8B valuation.
* SunPower has filed for bankruptcy and plans to sell off its assets.

# Google Gets the Monopoly Hammer: What’s Next?

# The Verdict Is In

In a ruling that could shake up the tech world, a federal judge has declared that Google ($GOOGL) is, indeed, an illegal monopoly. Judge Amit Mehta didn’t mince words, stating, “Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.” This is a major win for the Department of Justice, which has been chasing Google for years, accusing the tech giant of smothering competition in search and advertising.

But hold your horses—this is just the beginning. The next phase will decide what happens to Google. Will it be slapped on the wrist with a fine, or could it face a breakup? While the latter sounds juicy, it’s probably not going to happen. Google’s appealing the ruling, so this could drag out longer than your latest Netflix binge.

# Big Tech's Turn in the Hot Seat

Google isn’t the only tech giant sweating right now. Amazon ($AMZN), Apple ($AAPL), and Meta ($META) are all facing similar antitrust scrutiny. Regulators argue that these companies have been acting like playground bullies, pushing around smaller rivals and favoring their own products. The Google ruling could set the stage for how these cases unfold, but whether it’ll lead to actual change remains to be seen.

# Investors Hit Snooze

While the ruling is big news, investors don’t seem too concerned. Alphabet’s stock dipped a bit with the rest of the market but quickly bounced back. Analysts like Wedbush’s Dan Ives aren’t expecting any major disruptions to Google’s operations in the near term, so it looks like business as usual—for now.

So, what’s next? We’re all just waiting to see if this ruling will actually make a dent in Google’s search dominance or if it’s just another chapter in the ongoing saga of Big Tech vs. The World.

# Uber’s Q2 Earnings Shift into High Gear

# By the Numbers

* **Earnings per share (EPS):** 47 cents (vs. 31 cents expected)
* **Revenue:** $10.7 billion (vs. $10.57 billion expected)
* **Mobility Gross Bookings:** $20.6 billion (up 23% YoY)
* **Delivery Gross Bookings:** $18.1 billion (up 16% YoY)
* **Net Income:** $1.02 billion
* **Monthly Active Platform Consumers (MAPCs):** 156 million (up 14% YoY)
* **Total Trips:** 2.77 billion (up 21% YoY)

# Zooming Past Expectations

Uber ($UBER) put the pedal to the metal in Q2, delivering earnings that sped past Wall Street’s forecasts. The company reported 47 cents per share, outpacing the expected 31 cents, while revenue came in at $10.7 billion, topping predictions. With its mobility unit seeing a 23% surge in gross bookings and delivery bookings rising 16%, Uber’s growth engine is firing on all cylinders.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was riding high, noting that Uber’s monthly active platform consumers reached 156 million, a 14% increase from last year, with 2.77 billion trips during the quarter. The market took notice, sending Uber’s stock up 10.9% following the report.

# Looking Ahead

For the third quarter, Uber is forecasting gross bookings between $40.25 billion and $41.75 billion, with adjusted earnings expected to land between $1.58 billion and $1.68 billion. While the midpoint is just shy of analysts' estimates, it still signals that Uber expects to keep cruising along smoothly.

# The Road to Autonomous

Khosrowshahi didn’t shy away from addressing Tesla’s ($TSLA) potential robotaxi threat. He assured investors that Uber’s partnerships with Waymo and other AV players put it in a prime position to dominate the autonomous vehicle space. Uber’s platform, he emphasized, is unmatched in its ability to offer AV companies the scale they need without the headache of building their own network.

After a rough start to the year, Uber’s stock is gaining traction. With a focus on innovation and expansion, Uber seems ready to stay ahead in the race for the future of transportation. 

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

With recession jitters on the rise, all eyes are on the labor market. But while jobs bring in the cash, it’s the way Americans spend it that really tells the story. As spending slows—thanks in large part to sky-high inflation—companies start to feel the pinch, forcing McDonald’s to keep those $5 deals on the menu a bit longer.

That’s why tomorrow’s consumer credit report is so important: it’s a snapshot of not just how much people are spending, but also how much debt they’re piling up—the good (mortgages) and the not-so-good (credit cards). Normally, this report flies under the radar, but this time it could be key in shaping monetary policy in the coming months.

**Wednesday:** Disney ($DIS), Novo Nordisk ($NVO), Sony ($SONY), Shopify ($SHOP), CVS Health ($CVS), Hilton Worldwide ($HLT), Lyft ($LYFT), Monster Beverage ($MNST), Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD), Robinhood ($HOOD), Duolingo ($DUOL)

# Before Market Open: 

* Disney ($DIS) has hit some turbulence lately, with sky-high prices at theme parks, fierce streaming competition, and cautious consumer spending weighing it down. But recent box office wins have revived some optimism, and Wall Street still believes in the Magic Kingdom: 21 out of 26 analysts rate the stock as a “buy,” with a target price about 40% higher than its current level. Consensus: $1.19 EPS, $23.05 billion in revenue.
* Shopify ($SHOP) has had a rough 2024, with its stock nosediving due to worries over slowing consumer spending, challenging economic conditions for small businesses, and declining revenue. Investors are eager for signs of a turnaround this quarter, and given the stock’s current valuation, it might just catch the eye of bargain hunters. Consensus: $0.20 EPS, $2.01 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* Robinhood ($HOOD) blew past analyst expectations last quarter, delivering an EPS of $0.18 versus the expected $0.05. Investors are crossing their fingers for a repeat performance this quarter, though volatility in cryptocurrencies—a favorite among Robinhood traders—could put a dent in trading revenue and profits. Consensus: $0.15 EPS, $631.82 million in revenue.

# Breaking Up Google? DOJ Considers a Historic Move

Google ($GOOGL) has long reigned supreme with its trifecta of Search, Android, and YouTube, but its days of unchecked dominance might be numbered. After a federal court ruled that Google’s been playing monopoly with the internet search market, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is considering some drastic measures that could permanently alter Google’s empire—and send shockwaves through Big Tech.

# Google’s Breakup Drama

For the first time in over 20 years, the DOJ is mulling over the breakup of a major tech company, and Google’s in the crosshairs. This isn’t just a slap on the wrist; the DOJ is reportedly considering forcing Google to shed some of its most profitable assets. Imagine Google Ads—responsible for a staggering $238 billion in 2023—being spun off into a separate entity. That’s just one option on the table. Another scenario could see Google being forced to sell off its Android operating system or Chrome browser, two products that are practically synonymous with the internet itself. The potential breakup could not only reshape Google but could also set a new precedent for regulating other tech giants.

# Flashback to Microsoft’s 2000 Antitrust Battle

If this all sounds familiar, it’s because we’ve seen something like this before. Back in 2000, the DOJ went after Microsoft for its near-total control over the PC market. While the attempt to break up Microsoft was eventually overturned on appeal, the case did lead to restrictions that slowed down the tech giant’s dominance just enough to allow new players—like Google—to rise. Now, Google might find itself in a similar position. The DOJ could impose rules that force Google to share its valuable data and technology with competitors or ban it from entering exclusive contracts that keep rivals at bay. Case in point: Google’s $26 billion splurge to secure default search engine status on iPhones and Firefox. These kinds of practices could soon be a thing of the past.

# Silicon Valley on High Alert

While Google is currently the star of this antitrust drama, every other tech behemoth—from Amazon to Apple to Meta—is watching with bated breath. The outcome of Google’s case could have far-reaching consequences, especially as these companies face their own antitrust challenges. A decision to break up Google could embolden regulators to take a tougher stance across the board, fundamentally altering the landscape of the tech industry. The DOJ is set to reveal its proposed remedies in September, and until then, all of Silicon Valley is on edge, knowing that the stakes have never been higher.

# Walmart Q2 Surge: Higher Sales, Raised Outlook

# By the Numbers:

* **Revenue:** $169.34 billion (vs. $168.46 billion expected)
* **Adjusted EPS:** $0.67 (vs. $0.65 expected)
* **US Same-Store Sales Growth:** 4.2%
* **E-Commerce Growth:** 22% in the U.S.
* **Full-Year Sales Guidance:** 3.75% to 4.75%

# Walmart’s Winning Streak

Walmart ($WMT) just dropped some numbers, and it looks like they're riding high on the wave of deal-seeking shoppers. The retail giant raised its full-year sales outlook, now predicting a rise of up to 4.75%, a bump from its previous cap of 4%. Thanks to a growing number of customers—especially those from higher-income brackets—scouring for bargains, Walmart's stock surged today, marking its biggest intraday gain since late 2022.

The real juice? E-commerce sales in the U.S. shot up by 22%, largely driven by pickups and Walmart’s third-party marketplace. This growth wasn’t just in the grocery aisles either; after 11 quarters of decline, general merchandise sales finally showed some life. Seasonal items like pool noodles were particularly popular—so much so that you could stretch all the noodles sold across 30,000 football fields. That’s a lot of backyard fun.

# Cautious Optimism Amid Economic Uncertainty

Walmart’s success contrasts sharply with other retailers like Home Depot ($HD) and Whirlpool ($WHR), which have been struggling as consumers put off big-ticket purchases. Meanwhile, Walmart continues to rake in customers across all income levels, including a significant chunk from wealthier households hunting for deals.

With the back-to-school season off to a strong start and inflationary pressures easing a bit, Walmart’s cautious optimism about the rest of the year seems well-placed. The retailer is focusing on keeping prices down, pushing suppliers to do the same, and expanding its high-margin businesses like advertising and membership programs. And with more shoppers tightening their belts and opting for at-home dining over takeout, Walmart’s grocery dominance is likely to continue driving growth.

  


# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s spotlight shines on some key real estate data, with building permits and housing starts on deck. These reports will show us if the construction of new homes is gaining momentum or hitting the brakes.

We'll also get a read on the consumer vibe with the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey. While recent numbers suggest the economy is on the mend, this survey will reveal if the average American is actually feeling the love.

# Circle K Operator Eyes 7-Eleven in Mega-Deal

Alimentation Couche-Tard ($ANCTF) , the Canadian powerhouse operator behind Circle K, is pulling out all the stops with a fresh bid to acquire Japan's Seven & i Holdings, the parent company of 7-Eleven. If this $38 billion proposal gets the green light, it could end up being the company's biggest deal yet—but that’s just the starting figure( only based on Seven & i Holdings Marker Cap). When you factor in earnings multiples, the final price tag could soar as high as $86 billion. Yes, you read that right.

# Chasing the Convenience Crown

Couche-Tard has been deal-hungry since its humble beginnings in Quebec, and they aren’t slowing down. Founder Alain Bouchard has had 7-Eleven on his wishlist for decades, and now he’s making his boldest play yet. The acquisition would catapult Couche-Tard to the top of the global convenience store game, adding 7-Eleven's 13,000 North American locations to its already impressive portfolio.

But it’s not all smooth sailing—U.S. antitrust regulators are likely to scrutinize the deal, fearing it could lead to higher prices and fewer jobs. Couche-Tard is no stranger to regulatory challenges, though. They’ve tangled with authorities before, most notably in their failed bid to buy France's Carrefour ($CRRFY) in 2021.

# A New Era for Japanese Assets?

This deal, if it happens, would be the biggest foreign acquisition of a Japanese company ever. Seven & i has been under pressure from activist investors to streamline its operations, and selling to Couche-Tard could be a win-win. Japanese assets are hot commodities right now, with renewed interest from global investors spurred by governance reforms and a booming stock market.

As Couche-Tard gears up for this potentially historic deal, one thing is clear: They’re playing for keeps in the global convenience store arena. Whether they can clear the hurdles remains to be seen, but if any company can pull off a mega-merger, it’s the deal-hungry Couche-Tard.

# Google’s IPO Turns 20: $1,000 Then Worth $66K Today

**Then and Now**  
Remember when Google ($GOOGL) was just a scrappy startup with big dreams of organizing the world’s information? Well, 20 years ago from yesterday, they went public in a super unconventional way—a Dutch auction, where investors set the price by bidding. If you had thrown $1,000 into the pot back then, it would be worth about $66,522 today. Not bad for something cooked up in a Stanford dorm room.

**Dominating the Market**  
Fast forward two decades, and Google—now under Alphabet—has morphed into a global powerhouse, controlling over 90% of the search market and pulling in $328 billion in revenue over the last year. It’s still swimming in cash, with $30 billion in free cash flow, making sure it stays ahead in the AI race. But it's not all smooth sailing. The feds are breathing down its neck, with a recent antitrust ruling against it and whispers of a potential breakup. Yet, despite the legal drama, Google’s grip on our daily lives remains ironclad.

**The Road Ahead**  
While Google is dealing with regulatory headaches and the threat of new rivals like OpenAI, it’s still got a few tricks up its sleeve. With a mountain of data, cutting-edge tech, and deep pockets, Alphabet is well-positioned to fend off challenges. So, could Google keep rewarding investors for another 20 years? If you ask Wall Street, the answer is: probably. After all, this isn’t just any search engine—it’s Google. And if you’re still unsure about the question just Google it.



# Lowe's Q2: Waiting for the Home Improvement Comeback

# By The Numbers:

* **Revenue:** $23.59 billion (down 5.6% YoY)
* **Adjusted EPS:** $4.10 (beat $3.97 estimate)
* **Same-Store Sales:** -5.1% (worse than expected -4.43%)
* **Full-Year Sales Forecast:** Now $82.7B-$83.2B (down from $84B-$85B)
* **Comparable Sales Forecast:** -3.5% to -4% (previously -2% to -3%)

Lowe's ($LOW) just trimmed its full-year forecast as the DIY boom continues to fizzle. The home improvement giant is feeling the squeeze from a sluggish housing market, high interest rates, and inflation that's keeping consumers away from big renovation projects. Now, Lowe's expects comparable sales to drop 3.5% to 4%, a steeper decline than previously thought.

CEO Marvin Ellison points out that with mortgage rates sitting higher than a ladder in an attic, folks are putting off the move-and-renovate cycle. Instead, they're waiting for the Federal Reserve to give the green light with a rate cut, which, let’s be honest, feels like watching paint dry. For now, big-ticket items like kitchen overhauls and flooring projects are taking a back seat.

However, it’s not all doom and gloom. Lowe's saw some bright spots with their pro customers—think contractors and electricians—who’ve kept their tool belts busy, driving sales in building materials and appliances. Meanwhile, online sales showed some growth too, which the company is trying to boost by expanding delivery options.

Despite the challenges, Lowe's shares have risen 9.3% year-to-date, even as they lag behind the S&P 500's 18% gain. The company’s outlook suggests the industry is waiting for the pendulum to swing back, with a potential recovery possibly starting in 2025. Until then, both Lowe’s and Home Depot ($HD) are playing the waiting game, hoping for that DIY resurgence.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Investors will have the chance to review the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July meeting. The FOMC, responsible for setting U.S. monetary policy, holds significant influence over decisions like interest rate adjustments. Although no rate cuts were made during their last meeting, the minutes may offer insights into whether the committee is leaning towards future cuts and which economic indicators are guiding their decisions. Understanding these details is crucial for investors as they navigate market expectations.

# Before Market Open: 

* **Target** ($TGT) made waves earlier this year by slashing prices on 5,000 items in a bid to lure back consumers, raising concerns about the state of consumer spending. However, as other retailers have posted strong earnings, it remains to be seen if Target can keep pace or if it's losing ground to competitors. Analysts are expecting earnings of $2.19 per share and revenue of $25.22 billion.
* **Analog Devices** ($ADI) has enjoyed a meteoric rise in stock price, fueled by the excitement around AI. But with such rapid gains, investors are now questioning whether the stock's surge is justified. They’ll be looking for confirmation that the company can sustain last quarter's impressive revenue growth to support its lofty valuation. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.50 per share on $2.27 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **Snowflake** ($SNOW), a major player in cloud computing, has been struggling to keep up with its competitors despite the AI boom. The company has been burning through cash to close the gap, a strategy that hasn’t sat well with shareholders who are concerned about rising operating costs and shrinking profits. Investors will be looking for a clear turnaround plan from management. The consensus calls for earnings of $0.16 per share on $851.16 million in revenue.
* **Zoom** ($ZM), once a pandemic favorite, has seen its stock plummet since lockdowns ended. Now, the company is being eyed by some as a potential value play, with investors wondering if the prolonged selloff has bottomed out. If so, they might be looking at a company in the midst of a significant transformation. Expectations are for $1.21 in earnings per share on $1.15 billion in revenue."

# Google Back in the Hot Seat — The Antitrust Saga Continues

The Justice Department is back for round two with Google, and this time it’s all about ad-tech. Weeks after a judge ruled the tech behemoth was illegally dominating search, another trial kicks off, this time in Virginia, targeting Google’s stronghold on digital advertising technology. The lawsuit claims Google has an unlawful monopoly over tools that buy and sell digital ads—tools that are essential for keeping online publishers afloat.

# The Case: Google’s Ad-Tech Monopoly?

The trial, expected to last several weeks, aims to determine whether Google’s control of both the buy-side and sell-side of the ad-tech ecosystem is crushing competition. The Justice Department, backed by 17 states, argues that Google’s practices have locked out rivals, with advertisers and publishers feeling forced to use its tools. They’re demanding Google shed its Ad Manager, which generated $368 million in profits from $7.4 billion in revenue in 2020 alone.

This isn’t the first time Google has been hit with monopoly claims. A federal judge recently ruled that Google illegally maintained dominance in search, but this case could potentially cut deeper. If Google loses, it might have to sell off key parts of its advertising business, which is crucial to Alphabet’s overall revenue—78% of its $307 billion annual earnings come from advertising.

# Google’s Defense: The Market Has Changed

In response, Google claims the Justice Department is stuck in the past, focusing on outdated desktop advertising models while consumer attention has shifted to mobile apps, social media, and streaming platforms like TikTok and Peacock. Google’s legal team insists that the ad-tech space is more competitive than ever, with alternatives like Microsoft and Amazon gaining ground.

But the trial has already hit some bumps for Google. The company is facing scrutiny for allegedly deleting internal chat messages relevant to the case, something the judge criticized as ""not the way a responsible corporate entity should function."" This issue could factor into how the court weighs the credibility of witnesses.

# What’s Next for Google?

The trial, held without a jury, could significantly alter Google’s ad-tech empire. A government win would likely mean divesting parts of Google’s ad business, untangling years of acquisitions. With Google’s advertising technology so deeply embedded in the digital landscape, this case could reshape the industry for advertisers and publishers alike. And with antitrust regulators in both the U.S. and Europe breathing down its neck, Google’s struggles are far from over.

This is just the beginning of a legal battle that could send shockwaves through Big Tech.

# CPI Tomorrow — Inflation Data Holds the Key

This week, the Federal Reserve is set to get its final look at inflation numbers before its next policy meeting on September 18. With interest rate cuts all but certain, the key question now is: how big will the cut be? The answer hinges on two upcoming inflation reports—the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI). These reports are expected to clarify the Fed’s next move, especially after Friday’s jobs report provided little guidance.

# CPI & PPI: The Deciding Factors

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release August’s CPI report, followed by the PPI on Thursday. Economists are predicting a 0.2% monthly increase for both headline and core CPI, bringing annual inflation rates to 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively. The PPI is expected to mirror these figures. While the Fed’s preferred inflation measure is the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, this week’s CPI and PPI readings will still play a crucial role in determining the size of the upcoming rate cut.

The debate is now centered on whether the Fed will opt for a modest 25-basis-point cut or go bigger with a 50-basis-point reduction. Futures markets currently favor a quarter-point cut, with odds hovering around 71%. However, a stronger-than-expected inflation reading could push the Fed toward a more aggressive move. Economists like Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, believe inflation data should be favorable for at least a small cut.

# Shifting Focus: From Inflation to Jobs

While inflation has been the Fed's main concern for months, the focus is now turning toward the labor market. Hiring has slowed significantly, with nonfarm payroll gains averaging just 135,000 per month since April, down from 255,000 in the prior five months. Job openings have also declined, raising fears that the labor market is weakening. This shift has increased expectations that the Fed will begin cutting rates sooner rather than later, starting with a baby step at the next meeting.

# What’s Next?

After this week’s inflation reports, all eyes will be on the Fed’s September 18 meeting. If the data shows more progress in curbing inflation, the central bank may lean toward a larger rate cut. But even if the Fed starts small, markets expect more cuts to follow, with a possible half-point reduction in November and another in December. As the Fed navigates these murky waters, the balance between taming inflation and supporting a cooling labor market will guide its next moves.

# 



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Inflation’s about to take center stage again. Tomorrow, we get the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) report—aka, the data that shows how much more (or less) expensive life has gotten over the past year. While the Fed has plenty of tools to gauge inflation, CPI is the star of the show—especially core CPI, which leaves out the drama of volatile food and energy prices.

Economists are penciling in a 0.2% rise for August, same as July’s bump. If that holds, it would push annual inflation down from 2.9% to 2.6%. Core inflation is also expected to clock in at 3.2% year-over-year. If these numbers land as predicted, the Fed will probably have the green light to trim rates by 25 basis points at next week’s meeting.

1. I remain stoic as a trader, it is hard but you need to remain calm at all points of trading. If you are ever scratching your head or surprised by something happening you DID NOT PREPARE to trade.
2. You need to accept all possible outcomes of a trade, and fully understand and accept that you WILL BE WRONG on trades, what matters is you are right at least a little more than wrong
3. Risk management, no big trades, no revenge trading, no overtrading (Trade just to make a trade), Do not risk more than 2% per trade, may be even better to risk less than 1% per trade.
4. Stick to one strategy, it can be overwhelming trying to do multiple strategies at once.
5. I don't recommend averaging down on losses, as this can lead to the occasional huge loss that can wipe out a lot of gains. Learn to cut losers quick. get in the habit of it and DONT HOPE.
6. Risking more than 2% can end in catastrophic consequences, see all those traders who wiped out their accounts trying to hit it big. Look for small consistent wins.
7. No Fomo, if you see a big pump that has already happened and just blindly jump in without waiting for any confirmation of a continuing trend, you will find yourself disappointed most of the time and find yourself buying the tops.
8. Learn to trade both sides of the market up and down. I find when I just tried to be bullish, I would miss a lot of opportunity and I would find myself forcing trades that were not favorable, learn to short and profit when stocks go down.
9. Learn the events, big earnings day? FOMC meeting? You need to be on guard for this, and know that the market sometimes does a whipsaw effect where it will shoot up in one direction, then dump all the way back down lower, it can be very volatile and unpredictable. I've seen plenty of these where the market would shoot up 1% in 1 minute just to come back all the way down in 3 minute candle sticks.
10. If you struggle with gambling, this will absolutely destroy your portfolio, even if you had a profitable week, you will end up gambling all your gains. Refrain from big trades that are done purely to gamble and double your gains, it realistically won't work long-term.

I wish you all the best of luck, I've been trading 6 hours a day, I take a 30 minute lunch break. Either I'm one of the lucky ones or I'm onto something. I'm still learning, and recently picked up options trading this past month.

Seeing where I can go with that."

I notice a lot of bugs in different software’s lately. From train rides to google maps. Apple shipping phones with AI features but they are not ready. Are we with to much hype? 

Now we have rate cuts and that should be bullish. I hear a lot of people being bullish. But that would be just to easy right? Thats my feeling. Im not an data expert though…. Yea just me bragging but maybe someone will join this discussion. Have a good weekend all 👋

2024-09-29 11:03:26,Frisps_,Hedgefunds?,Correct me if I’m wrong but I have learnt that a hedgefund is essentially paying a well seasoned trader to invest your money and try to return a profit whilst taking a cut for themselves. If this is the case why do people often spend so many years in the negatives trying to learn when they could recieve much greater returns from getting someone who has already done all the hard work to trade for them?
2024-10-03 03:47:51,basscascade,A genuine question from someone who is just curious.,"Hi all! I was just, as the title suggests, curious about bigger traders. If there are any and I'm sure there are a few bigger traders- traders with capital exceeding 5M, where would they trade? What platform/broker would they use? Let's assume for clarity of answers that this was personal not firm capital and this person just wanted to trade with that sort of money. How would they go about it with things like slippage, getting entries- and say this person were to trade currencies or futures. I know that the average person can make a broker/platform account and deposit a good 4-5 figures and trade fine, but what about this person with 7-8 figures?

  
thanks in advance. just trying to gain insight since google didn't really help :)"

# Activist Investor Starboard Value Takes $1 Billion Stake in Pfizer

It's the classic tale of a corporate shake-up: missed targets, mounting investor frustration, and then the activists come knocking on your door. Starboard Value, helmed by the ""most feared man in corporate America"" Jeff Smith, has just taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer, seeking to revive the pharmaceutical giant's fortunes.

Pfizer's stock rose 2.12% on the news but remains down 1.83% for 2024—a stark contrast to the S&P 500's 20% climb this year.

**A Pandemic Peak and a Post-Covid Slump**  
Pfizer's pandemic glory days seem like a distant memory. During the peak, the company became a household name thanks to its record-breaking vaccine rollout. Revenues skyrocketed from $42 billion in 2020 to $100 billion in 2022. But as the world returned to normal, demand for its Covid-19 products took a nosedive.

The problem? Pfizer's other offerings couldn't pick up the slack. Even its much-hyped anti-obesity drug flopped, leaving the pharma giant without a clear path forward.

CEO Albert Bourla went on a spending spree during the pandemic—nearly $70 billion in acquisitions since 2020—while also boosting Pfizer's R&D budget. Despite these efforts, results have been underwhelming.

Just this month, Pfizer had to pull a sickle cell drug it acquired for $5 billion. Another setback in its acquisition-heavy growth strategy.

**Reuniting with the Old Guard**  
Now, Starboard is looking to bring back some familiar faces: ex-CEO Ian Read and ex-CFO Frank D'Amelio. Both have expressed interest in returning to help steady the ship, according to reports.

Under Read's leadership from 2010 to 2018, Pfizer had a more focused approach, zeroing in on core businesses like vaccines and cancer. Starboard seems to hope that a dose of the old guard's discipline can turn things around.

Pfizer has already started reining in spending, with a $4 billion cost-cutting program announced last year. But it hasn't been enough to lift the company out of its post-pandemic slump.

Maybe Starboard's intervention, paired with a reunion of past leaders, can help Pfizer regain its lost momentum—or at least give the stock a much-needed shot in the arm.

# Google Play Must Allow Rival Android App Stores, Judge Rules

Big news in the tech world: a federal judge has ordered Google to loosen its grip on the Android app market. Starting November, the tech giant must allow rival app stores to compete more freely with Google Play—a move that could reshape how apps are distributed across Android devices.

The ruling comes after Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, scored a significant victory in its long-standing antitrust battle against Google. The judge concluded that Google abused its power by restricting developers and creating barriers for competing app stores.

Now, for the next three years, Google can't force developers to exclusively use its app store or its billing features. Rival stores will also get a shot at accessing Google's app catalog.

**Antitrust Pressure Mounts**  
The court's decision is the latest blow in Google's ongoing struggle with antitrust authorities. Just this August, the search giant lost another major case over claims that it monopolized online search and advertising markets. The pressure on Google keeps mounting, and it's not just in the U.S.—regulators worldwide are eyeing similar app store practices.

Judge James Donato, who issued the ruling, made it clear that his aim is to restore fair competition. Google will have to let developers tell customers about alternative ways to download apps, allow rival stores to have access to its platform, and ensure that app developers aren't forced to use Google's billing services.

The injunction lasts until 2027, giving competitors time to establish a meaningful presence in the Android ecosystem.

**Epic Games Is Not Done Yet**  
Epic Games, which has had mixed results in a similar lawsuit against Apple, isn’t backing down. CEO Tim Sweeney took to social media, announcing that Epic will launch its own app store on Android next year. He sees this ruling as a major opportunity for developers, carriers, and app store makers to create a more competitive Android ecosystem.

Google, for its part, is gearing up to appeal. The company insists its practices benefit users by enhancing security and consistency on Android devices. The judge allowed Google to implement ""reasonable measures"" to ensure platform security, but those measures will be under scrutiny by a committee formed by both Epic and Google.

The battle over app stores is far from over.

But one thing is certain: this ruling opens the door for a lot more competition in the Android world.

Tomorrow brings the release of the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for September, offering a glimpse into how small businesses are feeling about the economy. Last month, the Index dipped 2.5 points to 91.2, marking the 32nd straight month below the 50-year average of 98. Inflation was the main worry for most businesses, but with the first rate cut now in effect, it’ll be interesting to see if small business sentiment changes—or if they’re still feeling the pinch from higher costs.

Expectations are set at $2.29 EPS and $23.81 billion in revenue, so it’s more about maintaining the status quo than delivering a surprise."

# Short Seller Hindenburg Goes After Roblox

Roblox had a rough Tuesday after Hindenburg Research, a notorious short-seller, came swinging with allegations that the gaming platform is playing fast and loose with its numbers. 

The report accused Roblox of inflating user data and failing to protect its youngest players from harmful content. Naturally, the stock took a dive, dropping nearly 10% in early trading—a steep fall for the platform that’s been a favorite among younger gamers.

**More Bots Than Humans?**  
Hindenburg’s beef? The firm claims Roblox has been cooking the books by counting bots and duplicate accounts as individual users. According to the report, Roblox's daily user count may be overstated by up to 42%. And while Roblox claims its users are spending hours immersed in the digital world, Hindenburg suggests a lot of that ""engagement"" comes from bots that are just... there.

But the bigger blow? Hindenburg also painted a grim picture of the platform’s safety features, claiming Roblox isn’t doing enough to keep predators at bay. And for a platform with millions of young users, that’s a serious accusation.

**Roblox Fights Back**  
Roblox wasn’t about to sit quietly. The company shot back, calling Hindenburg’s report ""misleading"" and driven by the short-seller’s agenda. In a statement, they emphasized that user safety is a top priority and that the financial metrics they report are accurate. 

Roblox's defense comes with some financial backing: the company saw a 22% boost in bookings year-over-year and reported $576 million in free cash flow for the second quarter.

**The Fallout:** Despite the firm’s aggressive rebuttal, Roblox’s stock took a hit, falling by 9.4% before regaining some ground. Investors are likely left wondering if Hindenburg’s accusations will have lasting effects or if Roblox can shake off the controversy like it has before. Either way, it’s clear that the platform’s future will be closely watched, especially when it comes to how it handles both its user base—and the safety of those users.

# China Stocks Lose Steam, Traders Disappointed Without More Major Stimulus

China’s stock markets went from euphoria to disappointment faster than you can say “stimulus.” After weeks of rallying on hopes for a massive fiscal boost, investors were left high and dry on Tuesday when the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced just 200 billion yuan in spending—way short of the expected 3 trillion yuan. The Hang Seng Index dropped nearly 10%, marking its worst day since 2008, while Chinese stocks lost almost half their gains from an 11% surge earlier in the day.

The market's reaction is a clear sign of a mismatch between investor expectations and Beijing’s cautious fiscal stance. The rally, driven by monetary easing and government promises, now seems shaky without substantial fiscal follow-through.

**Stocks on a Rollercoaster**  
It wasn’t just disappointment in the air—it was a stock sell-off. Bank of China tumbled 5.38%, and the yuan slipped 0.64% against the dollar. The once-booming rally fizzled as investors realized that Tuesday’s announcement wasn’t the knockout punch they were hoping for. 

Analysts at Jefferies had pegged the potential damage at 175 billion yuan in a worst-case scenario, but Beijing’s response left the markets wondering if that punch is ever coming.For a brief moment, China’s stock market had a party—rising over 30% since late September—but the NDRC’s meager offering effectively ended the celebration.

**Is There More in the Pipeline?**  
While Tuesday’s lackluster stimulus dampened spirits, some analysts believe the big guns are still on their way. Banks like Morgan Stanley are betting that up to 2 trillion yuan in stimulus could still be in the works. The key question now: Will President Xi pull the trigger before markets lose faith?

For now, traders are left in a wait-and-see mode, with hopes that Beijing will unveil the kind of aggressive fiscal measures needed to fuel a long-term recovery. Until then, investors might need to buckle up for more market turbulence.

# The DOJ Wants To Break Up Google’s Monopoly

Google's monopoly reign might be facing its toughest challenge yet. The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) is weighing a move that could break up the tech titan after a judge ruled it unlawfully dominated search and ad markets. 

In a court filing, the DOJ proposed everything from breaking off pieces of Google’s business (think Chrome and Android) to forcing the company to share its search data with competitors. It’s a bold step that echoes the antitrust battles of the early 2000s…remember Microsoft?

Not surprisingly, Google isn’t too thrilled. The company called the DOJ’s plan ""radical"" and warned that messing with its business model could have unintended consequences, like fewer free services for users. Meanwhile, Alphabet shares slid 1.6% on the news—cue the market jitters.

**Tech Titans Under the Microscope**  
Google’s not the only one sweating right now. Almost half of the S&P 500, including big names like Meta, Nvidia, and Amazon, are in antitrust hot water too. Regulators are accusing them of crushing competition and monopolizing key markets. 

But, despite these lawsuits, Big Tech’s still living its best life, with stock prices climbing thanks to AI innovation.

The DOJ’s real focus? The future of search, especially with AI on the rise. They want to prevent Google from flexing its dominance as AI-powered search tools become the norm. Regulators are thinking long-term here, trying to stop Google from maintaining its stranglehold in the tech space.

**The Long Legal Road Ahead**  
Judge Amit Mehta, who ruled Google was guilty of monopolistic behavior, now has to decide what to do about it. The DOJ’s suggested remedies range from “just change your behavior” to “time to break up the band.” 

While some experts think a breakup is unlikely (at least anytime soon), this legal battle is far from over. Google’s going to fight, and they’re likely to appeal any decisions not in their favor.

**The Big Picture:** Despite the legal storm, analysts aren’t losing sleep over it. Tech stocks have been riding high, with investors more interested in earnings and product launches than courtroom drama. For now, it’s business as usual, but if the DOJ really manages to pull off a Google breakup? Well, that could be a game-changer.

* **🤖 Amazon’s Robot-Powered Warehouse Expansion:** Amazon ($AMZN) revealed plans for a new “next-generation fulfillment center” in Louisiana, powered by 10x more robots than its typical warehouse. The facility spans 3 million square feet and houses advanced robotic systems like Sequoia, which can store over 30 million items. Despite the robotic increase, Amazon still plans to employ 2,500 people at the new location.
* **🎟️ Disneyland Hikes Ticket Prices:** Disneyland ($DIS) is raising prices for its highest-demand tickets by $7-$12, while annual passes will see a 6-20% increase. The top-tier pass will now cost $1,749, though the base ticket price remains at $104.
* **✈️ Boeing Pulls Pay Raise Offer Amid Strikes:** Boeing ($BA) has retracted its 30% pay raise offer to 30,000 striking workers and suspended negotiations.

* **🍔 McDonald’s Sues Meat Suppliers Over Price Fixing:** McDonald’s ($MCD) is suing major U.S. meatpackers, including Tyson ($TSN), JBS, Cargill, and National Beef, alleging a conspiracy to fix beef prices by limiting supply since 2015.
* **🚕 Supreme Court Rejects Uber and Lyft Appeal:** The Supreme Court declined to hear Uber ($UBER) and Lyft’s ($LYFT) appeal, leaving them liable for back wages owed to California drivers misclassified as independent contractors.
* **💸 Fed Officials Split on Rate Cut Size:** Federal Reserve officials were divided at their September meeting over whether to cut interest rates by half a point. Most favored the larger cut to balance inflation concerns with the strong labor market, though a few members argued for a smaller, 25 basis point cut. Since then, the labor market has outperformed expectations, solidifying predictions for a slower pace of future rate cuts.
* **🚗 Tesla and BYD See Chinese Sales Boost:** Tesla’s ($TSLA) Chinese-made EV sales rose 19.2% YoY in September, while its rival BYD saw an even larger surge, with sales increasing 45.56% YoY.

# WeightWatchers To Offer Compounded GLP-1 Weight-Loss Drugs

WeightWatchers just jumped into the weight-loss drug game with a twist. The company announced it’ll start offering a compounded version of Wegovy (aka a cheaper knockoff) after facing shortages of the real deal. 

At $129 for the first month and $189 thereafter, it’s a far cry from the $1,300 price tag of branded options like Ozempic. Naturally, the stock shot up by nearly 47% on the news.

But the real question is—how long can this ride last?

**It’s Getting Crowded in Here**  
WeightWatchers is showing up a bit late to the knockoff Wegovy party, where companies like Hims & Hers and Noom have been hanging out for months. But what WeightWatchers brings to the table is its bread-and-butter combo of behavioral coaching and clinical support. 

So, it’s not just about the drugs—it’s about changing the whole lifestyle.

Still, the FDA is cracking down. They’ve already removed drugs like Mounjaro from the shortage list, which means compounded versions could disappear fast. For now, semaglutide (the magic behind Wegovy and Ozempic) remains in short supply, so WeightWatchers might still have time to carve out its slice of the market.

**WeightWatchers' Identity Crisis**  
This move comes at a shaky time for WeightWatchers. They’ve had a rough year, with their stock losing more than 90% of its value. Plus, CEO Sima Sistani exited stage left just two weeks ago, and Oprah—yes, *the* Oprah—ditched the board earlier this year after admitting she’s been on weight-loss meds herself. Yikes.

But interim CEO Tara Comonte is trying to steer the ship by banking on this drug offering, even as the weight-loss world shifts away from the traditional ""dieting"" approach that WeightWatchers has been known for.

**Can They Keep the Momentum?:** The stock surge suggests investors like what they’re seeing for now, but the weight-loss landscape is getting tougher by the day. With FDA regulations tightening and plenty of competitors already in the game, it’ll be interesting to see how long WeightWatchers can keep riding this wave.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The weekly initial jobless claims report is here again, and all eyes are on it, especially with the Fed’s focus on the labor market as it charts the course for future rate cuts.

However, tomorrow’s CPI report is set to steal the spotlight. CPI tracks the monthly price shifts in goods that Americans buy, making it a crucial measure of inflation. Economists predict a 2.3% annual increase in September’s CPI, up from August’s 2.1%, while core CPI, which excludes the more volatile food and energy prices, is expected to hold steady at 3.2%. If these numbers hold, the Fed may feel more confident about proceeding with rate cuts. But any surprises could throw a wrench in those plans, keeping investors on edge.

# Before Market Open:

* **Delta Air Lines** ($DAL) has been cruising with a 25% gain in 2024, but the real turbulence could hit with this week’s earnings. It’s the first report since their July tech fiasco that grounded flights and canceled over 7,000 trips worldwide. Management has prepped everyone for a hit to the bottom line, but now the question is, how hard will it land? Analysts expect $1.55 EPS on $14.74 billion in revenue.
* **Domino’s Pizza** ($DPZ), the global pizza king, has been slinging pies like a pro, thanks to its massive scale. But last quarter, things got a little sticky with slowing international growth and a sudden decision to stop sharing new store counts. Investors will be hungry for some answers. Consensus: $3.62 EPS, $1.1 billion in revenue."

* GDP YoY came in short of consensus, at 1% vs 1.4% expected
* 3 month average was also slightly short of consensus
* MOM was in line.  So weak GDP numbers 
* Inflation rate in Germany came in line with expectations - this was a final revision so not a big deal. Preliminary print had already paved the way.
* PPI event today. 
* Consumer inflation expectations - expected to have risen as commodity index has been on the rise. 
* Current conditions probably slightly better than expected, but let’s see. I say this as the economic surprise index has been trending up meaning we are more likely to surprise to upside than downside right now.

TSLA 10/10 EVENT

OTHER COMPANIES

* UBER - pumping this morning as Tesla’s robotaxi event disappointment seen as bullish for UBER. Citi note that **Tesla's event yesterday was a POSITIVE outcome for Uber, as Tesla did not provide verifiable evidence of progress toward Level 3 autonomy or specific robotaxi production numbers.

* AMD EVENT YDAY: Down 4% yesterday, flat in premarket today. Is a major tailwind for NVDA funnily enough, more so than AMD although AMD price action probably overreaction.
* Again, I have a full post on this with all of my thoughts here:
* Mixed reaction from analysts. Wells Fargo say is a buy. Overweight, PT 205. Others say was a bit of a non event.

* Said they are upgrading shares after investor meeting with CEO highlighted positives including drivers of high visibility earnings growth. Enthusiastic demand. Record pricing and backlog.

Please list edges in trading that you believe actually work. Later, I will list some that I believe in. Thanks! (Edit: so I've been schooled that what I am calling an edge is actually a strategy.)

Here's a simple example of what I mean by an ""edge"": **the break out**. The break out occurs when price is trending either up or down, and price breaks through a recent high or low level into a new high or low. One can place a stop order to buy or sell a tick or two past the recent high or low, expecting the current trend to continue.

(PS: someone in comments corrected that I am talking about trading strategies, not edges. You can google ""trading strategy vs edge"" to see about this. I need to read up....The first article I read claimed going for a more than 1:1 risk to reward ratio, such as 1:1.5 or higher, was an edge. I consider that good money management, not a trading edge; but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe ANYTHING that helps one trade better is an edge.)

(Another edit from 10/17: I am starting to realize that when I used ""edge"" in my original post, I really meant ""using technical analysis with greater efficacy."")"

2024-10-25 11:37:43,Cool-Mail-1070,Lost all gains in one day and learned a valuable lesson.,"I am a 20 years old who just got started in day trading 2 weeks ago. I was doing pretty well with 33% up with 100% win rate. Thus, I thought I knew everything and will be ""unstoppable"". Until yesterday, I missed a trade that could have made me another 15% in my account. With no doubt, I felt frustrated, made a deadly mistake,  and revenge traded. I started the day by jumping in when the stock was 40% down (stupid af), I BLINDLY TOOK THAT AS A PULL BACK. As the stock go down through out the day, I kept buying more to average it down. Now, the stock is -90% and... I lost all I made in the past 2 weeks in 6 hours lol. I am not mad at myself this time but rather felt lucky it was little money yet learned a valuable lesson.

Just in case a noob like me see this post, do not make the mistake I did:

1. Be emotionless, keep a cold head during the trade
2. Avoid revenge trading, emotions cost me heavily.
3. Be EXTREMELY careful and faithful with the set up
4. Don't be arrogant like I did haha
5. Trading is trading, do not make it gambling
6. Avoid penny stocks"
2024-10-27 13:20:18,SuperSeptember,Is it feasible to make 1% per day?,"I'm new to daytrading.

I've been trading crypto since 2017, and I'm in the profit, but not by much.

I have 0 training / education. But I juist pick up ""methods"" other people use... like checking RSI and going off of that sometimes. I remember something about using MACD and RSI... but long forgot how that works, but I did ""see"" how going up or down became somewhat predictable iwth MACD + RSI.

I also found certain timezones when price action up or down would most likely happen... and then get a certain ""feel"" for the price and if it was going up or down.

I also tried trading on news.

This was all crypto.. and so even if I was up due to daytrading... ofc, one day everything jsut crashes and I'd have lost all of everything.

So, now I want to leave crypto and try the ""safe"" way of trading: stocks (is it called equities?). I've googled stock prices S&P and DOW here and there. I saw they always recover and always end up going up. Like (unless you're boeing), most stocks relatively stay in the same price and recover after a bit.

So tl;dr: Can you like, wake up one day, check out AAPL prices, check the news, then do your ""analysis"" where you check indicators and decide to open a position, then close that position sometime later that day and make 1%... then rinse and repeat the next day?"

I'm here to say that i don't know how to trade, i don't know if i'll be able one day but i know one thing: i spent A LOT of time in it.
So, after years i was starting to understand a bit more about daytrading forex. Nothing special but in the last year i felt that i was in the right path. I started to understand more about price action, sessions and so on.

Today i started a new job and i'm asking myself how i'll manage this. I used to trade during london/ny session but now i won't be able to trade during the day ofcourse.

So i need an advice bc i'm scared to have just lost time studing something that now i can't apply. (I tried but during the work hours i can't give it the right attention) 

Should i move to a swing approach?
Should i focus to asian session during the night? (i live in italy)
Should i move to another kind of investment like ETFs or something more long-term?

# Alphabet Shares Rise On Earnings Beat Boosted by Cloud Revenue

Alphabet’s Q3 results just hit, and the tech giant exceeded Wall Street’s expectations thanks to—you guessed it—Google Cloud. 

Revenue clocked in at $88.3 billion, topping estimates, with Google Cloud alone raking in $11.35 billion, up nearly 35% from last year. CEO Sundar Pichai credits their “full-stack” AI, which is pulling in enterprise clients and making big gains against cloud behemoths like Amazon and Microsoft.

But it wasn’t all rosy. Google’s ad machine, its core revenue driver, is showing its age. Search pulled in $49.4 billion, and YouTube added another $8.9 billion, though both grew slower than last quarter. 

The ad market is a bit crowded these days, with TikTok, Amazon, and Netflix all vying for screen time and ad dollars, putting the squeeze on Alphabet’s ad growth.

**AI as Cost Cutter**  
  
With new CFO Anat Ashkenazi at the helm, Alphabet is taking a hard look at costs. She highlighted AI-powered efficiencies and “strategic” workforce adjustments, while also doubling down on data centers to power their expanding AI ambitions. These cost-focused moves aren’t just about trimming the fat—they’re about setting up for long-term AI-driven growth.

Investors liked what they saw, pushing Alphabet shares up 5.82% in after-hours trading. 

And as the rest of Big Tech gears up to report this week, Alphabet’s strong Q3 may set the pace, underscoring that in today’s market, AI might just be the ticket to the top.

($GOOGL)
* **🏢 Office Loan Stress Hits U.S. Regional Banks:** KeyCorp and Fifth Third Bancorp are grappling with rising non-performing loans in their commercial real estate portfolios, particularly in office space, as remote work dampens demand. Analysts warn of further strain as a $950B ""maturity wall"" looms. ($KEY), ($FITB)
* **🦃 Target Offers Budget Thanksgiving Meal Deals:** Target has lowered its Thanksgiving meal bundle to $20, covering a frozen turkey and sides. This move joins other grocers like Aldi and Walmart in making Thanksgiving affordable, as grocery inflation slows to 1.3% for September. ($TGT)

# Echelon Of Earnings

* 🍔 **McDonald’s** missed Wall Street expectations in Q3 as international sales struggled, with same-store sales dropping 1.5%—a worse hit than analysts had anticipated. The U.S. market offered a small lift with a 0.3% increase, aided by a popular $5 meal deal that resonated with lower-income consumers. Shares slipped 0.6% as investors eyed the potential impact of the recent E. coli outbreak affecting 20% of U.S. locations. Adjusted EPS came in at $3.23 ($MCD). 
* 🚗 **Ford’s** stock tumbled 8.44% after revising its 2024 outlook to the lower end of its profit range ($10 billion vs. up to $12 billion initially projected). High warranty costs and scaling back EV spending amid sluggish demand weighed on results, though Q3 earnings still beat expectations at $0.49 EPS on $43.07 billion in automotive revenue. Execs highlighted gains in its Ford Pro division but noted ongoing struggles to contain costs ($F). 
* 💳 **PayPal** fell 3.96% after issuing a revenue forecast for Q4 that undercut analyst estimates, citing a “price-to-value strategy” that may slow growth. While Q3 revenue of $7.85 billion came up slightly short, payment volume grew 9% to $422.6 billion. EPS rose 6% to $0.99, with the company focusing on enhancing checkout features and digital currencies to boost engagement ($PYPL). 
* 👟 **Crocs** plunged 19.17% after trimming its full-year sales growth outlook to 3% and forecasting a steep 15% decline in its HeyDude brand sales, as opposed to the prior 8%-10% dip expected. Crocs’ overall Q3 revenue rose 1.6% to $1.06 billion, though concerns over slower HeyDude performance and school bans on Crocs shoes kept investor sentiment down ($CROX). 
* 🔋 **AMD** slipped 7.64% in after-hours after its Q4 revenue forecast of $7.5 billion missed Wall Street’s target, dampening hopes for rapid growth in its AI chip business. Q3 saw an 18% jump in revenue to $6.82 billion and EPS in line with forecasts at $0.92, yet some investors worry AMD’s AI ambitions are lagging Nvidia’s. AI-related demand from data centers bolstered performance, but slowing gaming chip sales put a drag on results ($AMD). 
* 👻 **Snap** rebounded 7.07% after initially dropping on mixed Q3 results, with revenue climbing 15% to $1.37 billion, just ahead of expectations. Snapchat’s daily active users rose 9% to 443 million, driven by increased video engagement, though Q4 guidance came in soft as upper-funnel ad spending from large clients faltered. Snap approved a $500 million buyback as part of efforts to boost shareholder value ($SNAP). 
* 📈 **Reddit** soared 21.65% in after-hours trading as its Q3 sales and holiday-quarter forecast surpassed analyst expectations. Revenue for Q3 came in at $348.4 million, easily topping the $312.8 million consensus, and marked Reddit’s first profitable quarter since its IPO in March. The platform’s shares have nearly tripled from their debut price, a boost attributed to strong ad tech investments. For the holiday season, Reddit projects revenue between $385 million and $400 million, above the $356 million Wall Street forecasted ($RDDT).

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

September’s ADP report showed a strong boost in private sector jobs, with 143,000 positions added. If October’s numbers follow suit, the Fed might be smiling, knowing the labor market is still holding up amid their rate hikes.

Tomorrow, we get the first look at Q3 GDP, though it’s just the initial slice in a three-month data cake. Not the most precise reading, but still a useful clue for assessing the pulse of the U.S. economy.

And for earnings-watchers, two of the “Magnificent 7” stocks drop their results tomorrow, along with a heavyweight in Big Pharma and a legend in the condiment game.

# Before Market Open: 

* **Eli Lilly** is making waves as one of the top dogs in the weight-loss drug game, thanks to blockbuster meds like Mounjaro and Zepbound. But heads up—new GLP-1 contenders are popping up faster than you can say “pharma boom.” Luckily, Lilly’s broader pipeline is looking solid, and with profits soaring, they’ve got the cash flow to keep pouring into R&D. Analysts are betting on $4.49 EPS with $12.21 billion in revenue ($LLY).

# After Market Close: 

* **Microsoft**’s partnership with OpenAI should have it dominating the AI race, and while it’s a clear leader in the field, the stock’s been sluggish. Investors are eyeing ongoing boardroom drama at OpenAI, ballooning costs, and a lukewarm reception to Microsoft’s AI products. Still, Microsoft’s pouring billions into AI infrastructure, and shareholders are hoping that investment won’t be a money pit. Consensus: $3.10 EPS, $64.48 billion in revenue ($MSFT). 
* **Meta Platforms**, meanwhile, has shifted focus from the metaverse flop to an AI-heavy strategy. Over the past 18 months, Meta has laid off tens of thousands to boost efficiency, funneled funds into smart glasses, and built up Threads. But its bread and butter? Ads. With election season fueling political ad revenue, investors are eager to see Zuckerberg’s plans for reinvesting those profits. Consensus: $5.21 EPS, $40.13 billion in revenue ($META)."

# Super Micro Computer’s Auditor Ernst & Young resigns 

Super Micro’s rollercoaster ride hit a nosedive as Ernst & Young (EY) resigned as its auditor, citing “integrity concerns” that raised red flags on the company’s accounting practices.

EY’s exit sent the stock tumbling 33%, its worst drop in six years, and now leaves Super Micro scrambling for a new auditor just as the DOJ investigates allegations of revenue inflation from a former employee. For a company that surged with AI-driven demand earlier this year, the timing of these setbacks couldn’t be worse.

**Trust Issues and Rival Gains**  
  
This isn’t the first time Super Micro has come under fire for its numbers. Earlier this year, Hindenburg Research spotlighted the company for “glaring accounting red flags,” leading Super Micro to delay its annual financial report while it reassessed internal controls. 

Meanwhile, rivals like Dell may seize this moment to gain ground in the lucrative AI server market, where Super Micro has been a major player. As the stock continues to slump, the company’s competitors are watching closely.

**Delisting Risks Add Pressure**  
  
Super Micro’s troubles don’t end with its audit chaos. The company faces a November 16 deadline to regain compliance with Nasdaq rules or risk being delisted, a position it previously found itself in back in 2018. 

With time running out to find a new auditor, analysts are sounding alarms about the company’s future on the exchange. EY’s exit is a stark reminder of the fragility of market trust, and Super Micro now finds itself on thin ice with both Nasdaq and investors.

**Facing the Climb Back**  
  
Amid the upheaval, Super Micro is sticking to its core business promises, assuring stakeholders that its customer commitments and product roadmap remain on track. Yet, with its stock down over 75% from March highs and sentiment shaky, Super Micro’s future looks precarious. 

For a company that soared on the AI hype, rebuilding credibility with investors will require more than just words—it’ll need clear, clean financials and an auditor willing to sign on the dotted line.

# Russia Fines Google More Than The World's Entire GDP

Russia just dropped a $20 *decillion* fine on Google—yes, that’s 20 followed by 33 zeros. 

This “symbolic gesture,” as the Kremlin puts it, demands that Google unblock Russian state-supported media on YouTube, which the tech giant restricted following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While the sum is way beyond Google’s own market value, Moscow’s message is loud and clear: follow our rules, or face the fines.

**From Courts to Chaos**  
  
Google initially expected any disputes over blocked Russian channels to play out in U.S. or U.K. courts. Instead, Russian media companies have taken the fight global, with cases popping up from South Africa to Turkey. 

In one wild twist, South Africa’s High Court even approved the seizure of some Google assets, part of a broader Russian push to target Western companies ignoring local rulings.

**When Courts Become Weapons**  
  
Legal experts are calling this “lawfare”—using courts as geopolitical pawns. Russia’s recent laws let its courts go after Western companies as payback for sanctions, and as the fines pile up, experts warn this is just the start. 

The ongoing fines, doubling weekly, represent a fundamental shift in how international companies are forced to think about geopolitical risk, especially as Russian and Western courts butt heads.

**Just a Symbolic Sting?**  
  
Google, for its part, is playing it cool, saying these legal hurdles won’t hit the bottom line. Alphabet shares held steady, reflecting Wall Street’s confidence that these fines won’t put a dent in the company’s trillion-dollar valuation. 

For now, Google is calling Russia’s bluff—but with fines stacking up, it’s clear the stakes are high if this legal storm doesn’t blow over.

Brace yourselves: the US jobs report is coming, and it’s the one that could make or break the markets…again. This is the same report that sent shockwaves in August, and if October’s numbers fall short, we might be in for a repeat. Economists are projecting just 120,000 new jobs, a major dip from September’s jaw-dropping 254,000. And thanks to hurricanes and strikes muddying the picture, no one’s totally sure what to expect. The unemployment rate? It’s expected to hang tight at 4.1%.

Luckily, the earnings frenzy has calmed down a bit, so Friday’s looking pretty chill—unless, of course, the job numbers stir the pot."

It all feels so random, it's seriously depressing. I feel like ive wasted the last 5 months of hard obsessed work. Nothing works for me. I've tried to focus on ABCD/flag patterns, reversals, tape scalping in front of held bids/offers... i cant find anything that seems to have any edge.

I get up super early, have a great routine, am disciplined, but my account is still slowly bleeding away.

I focus on the tape, intraday S/R levels, VWAP, and moving averages. This week i started learning some stochastic-based setups... but overall it just feels so random. I don't know WHERE or HOW to develop an edge! Everyone says to keep it simple, but watching the candles and tape, it just goes up and down, basic patterns and simple strategies just don't hold any meaning. I get it's hard. I'm prepared for that. But i dont have a clue where to go from here. I feel like im just spinning my wheels wasting time everyday, with nothing to learn from the randomness.

Starting to feel like the only way to even begin to develop a strategic ruleset is to load my screens up with more indicators, and journal my good trades to see what worked for me.
The ""basics"" certainly aren't.

Today I was weary of Palantir so held off, but kept an eye on it and scalped a nice amount on it's way up.

Now there's obviously less to be made by waiting for the pop after earnings, but it greatly reduces the risk.

So does anyone do this exclusively? I'm thinking my new strategy is to just have 2 charts open of companies posting earnings at close and scalp whichever pops. It seems kinda fool proof.

# Fed Cuts Rates; Powell Says No If Asked To Resign By Trump

The Federal Reserve’s latest move to shave off another quarter point from interest rates has set the financial world abuzz with speculation. 

While the Fed lowered its target range to 4.5%-4.75% in hopes of sustaining economic growth, Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference left investors guessing about the central bank’s next steps—especially with the return of a Trump administration that’s poised to roll out potentially inflation-increasing policies. Could we be looking at a pause on further cuts? Here’s what’s on the radar.

**Election Outcome Adds to Economic Jigsaw**

In a twist of political fate, President Trump’s return brings new complexities to the Fed’s balancing act. Trump’s plans for tariff hikes, tax cuts, and deficit-boosting measures could pump inflation back into the economic engine, leading Powell and team to rethink the rate path in the months ahead.

For now, Powell has assured that near-term policy won’t hinge on political moves, but investors remain wary of a shake-up if inflation ticks back up.

Beyond the rate decision, Powell made it clear he won’t resign if pushed by Trump, asserting the Fed’s legal independence. This reiteration may reassure markets, but Trump’s previous run-ins with Powell indicate the president’s desire for influence. Though Powell’s term runs through 2026, the potential for friction looms as Trump aims for more direct influence over Fed policy.

**Rate Cuts: Will December See Another Trim?**

The Fed’s trajectory could take a cautious turn. Following today’s quarter-point cut—paired with a September 50-basis-point slash—some economists expect the Fed to slow the pace of cuts given the unpredictable landscape.

While the Fed’s dot plot hints at one more cut this year, higher bond yields and robust consumer data may prompt a slower approach. The Fed, it seems, might be “testing the waters” on neutral territory, keeping a careful eye on growth indicators as year-end approaches.

**Looking Ahead: Inflation, Growth, and the Big “If”**

As the Fed inches closer to what it calls a “neutral” rate level, the jury’s out on where it’ll settle next. Inflation has slowed but is still above target, and while the labor market remains solid, consumer confidence wavers with each policy shift. 

For now, Powell’s “middle path” approach reflects a broader aim: avoid over-tightening while making sure inflation doesn’t overshoot. But with political pressures mounting and fiscal policies waiting in the wings, all eyes are on December’s meeting for clues on how the Fed will steer the economy forward.

# Google Accidentally Leaks AI Agent 'Jarvis'

It turns out “Jarvis” isn’t just a Marvel fantasy anymore—Google accidentally gave the world a sneak peek of its own AI assistant with the same name, promising an unprecedented level of hands-on control over daily tasks. 

When the software briefly appeared on the Chrome Web Store, tech insiders quickly noticed that Google’s new prototype AI can navigate and operate computers independently, from booking flights to ordering groceries. Although users couldn’t fully engage with the app, the store’s description gave away Jarvis’ potential, sparking curiosity about the future of digital assistance.

**A Hands-Free Assistant in the Making**

Google’s Jarvis takes the role of a “computer-using agent,” aiming to automate web-based tasks by taking actions directly through the browser. According to reports, this AI leverages Google’s next-gen Gemini model, designed for efficiency and accuracy in interpreting what’s on the screen. 

While its functionality is currently limited to Chrome, Jarvis could evolve into a hands-free solution for common, mundane online tasks—no manual typing, clicking, or scrolling required.

**Race to the Autonomous AI Market**

Google’s Jarvis isn’t alone in the game. With contenders like Anthropic’s Claude and Microsoft’s Copilot Vision also testing similar “computer-using agents,” the competition is heating up. While Google’s extension for Chrome is designed to automate through screenshots and button interactions, Anthropic’s Claude offers an early-stage version that can handle basic actions. 

Meanwhile, OpenAI and Apple are also exploring AI with screen awareness and multi-app capability, aiming to give their assistants broad control over devices.

**What’s Next for Jarvis?**

The accidental release brought hype but also tempered expectations. Google quickly removed Jarvis from the store, but sources say it may be available for select testers come December. 

The tech giant’s current priority is squashing bugs and refining the user experience, suggesting that Jarvis might soon become an integral tool, possibly even ushering in a new era of everyday AI-driven convenience.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

These past two weeks have felt more like two months, but the end is near! Tomorrow’s big focus? The University of Michigan’s preliminary Consumer Sentiment Survey. Economists are hoping for a boost in consumer confidence, thanks to lower inflation and strong economic growth. With holiday shopping season around the corner, some extra optimism could mean bigger spending.

As for earnings, we’re gradually closing out this quarter—just in time to catch a breather.

**Before Market Open:**

* **Paramount**’s been on a rollercoaster this year, and the ride isn’t over. This summer, Skydance emerged as the winning bidder in a tug-of-war for the struggling media giant, though the ink’s not dry on the deal yet. Investors aren’t holding their breath, with doubts swirling about whether the merger will even close. And even if it does? Slowing revenue, rising losses, and a fierce streaming landscape aren’t exactly confidence boosters. Consensus: $0.21 EPS, $7 billion in revenue. ($PARA)"
