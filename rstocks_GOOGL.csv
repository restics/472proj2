2023-11-17 13:45:15,absoluteunitVolcker,The Verge - Sam Altman fired as CEO of OpenAI,"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23965982/openai-ceo-sam-altman-fired

* Sam Altman has been fired as CEO of OpenAI, the company announced on Friday. 

* Former OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is leaving after a ‘deliberative review process’ by the company’s board.

* Altman has largely been the face of OpenAI

“Mr. Altman’s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities,” the company said in its blog post. “The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.”


Chief technology officer Mira Murati will be the interim CEO. The company will be conducting a search for the permanent CEO successor. A spokesperson for OpenAI didn’t immediately return The Verge’s call for comment. 

This is an extremely sudden turn of events. Just last week, Altman keynoted at the company’s DevDay conference, where it announced a suite of major new updates to compete with other big tech companies like Microsoft and Google. OpenAI arguably kickstarted the current AI arms race with last year’s hugely-popular ChatGPT.

Microsoft, which has invested billions in OpenAI, tells The Verge it will continue to partner with the company. “We have a long-term partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft remains committed to Mira and their team as we bring this next era of AI to our customers,” according to a statement sent by Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw.

Altman has reportedly talked with Jony Ive, Apple’s former chief design officer, about making the “iPhone of artificial intelligence,” though Altman downplayed those rumors at a recent Wall Street Journal conference. He’s also the biggest shareholder in Humane, which just launched orders for its Humane AI Pin.

Altman was a co-founder of OpenAI and initially served as a co-chair of the company alongside Elon Musk. Musk left in 2018 to avoid a conflict of interest with Tesla. 

OpenAI also announced that co-founder Greg Brockman will be stepping down as chairman of the board, though Brockman will remain at the company."

Fast food giant McDonald’s unveiled plans for its largest expansion ever, aiming to open 10,000 more locations in the next four years. It will get some help from a multiyear agreement with Google, which is rolling out its cloud data and generative artificial intelligence technology in McDonald’s restaurants globally.

McDonald’s said using Google technology will help it speed service and make better use of millions of data points collected across its global system. Restaurant employees will use a chatbot called “Ask Pickles” to boost productivity, Bloomberg reported.

The chain, which currently operates 40,000 locations, will introduce significant advancements to its restaurant and customer platforms, including self-service ordering kiosks and the mobile app. The companies said McDonald’s would be the largest food service retailer to use Google Distributed Cloud.

In fiscal 2024, McDonald’s expects nearly 2% of systemwide sales growth, net new restaurant growth of more than 4%, and operating margin in the mid-to-high 40% range. The company will increase capital spending to about $2.5 billion.

Its My McDonald’s rewards members generated more than $20 billion in sales over the past year, McDonald’s said at an investor event. The global fast-food giant also wants to scale up its delivery, drive-through, and mobile-order business, and improve its core menu items.
What’s Next: McDonald’s is also introducing a new small-format restaurant called CosMc’s, which will be led by beverages and a small menu of food items and emphasize to-go purchases. The first location is Bolingbrook, Ill. It plans 10 locations by the end of 2024"

As reported by Parmy Olson for Bloomberg, Google has admitted that was not the case. Instead, the researchers fed still images to the model and edited together successful responses, partially misrepresenting the model's capabilities.

SAN FRANCISCO — Epic Games won an antitrust lawsuit against Google on Monday, in a landmark decision where a jury found Google broke competition laws in how it ran its app store.

The decision is a major blow to the tech giant and the concept that Big Tech companies should have complete control over how pricing and payments are done on their massive internet platforms. It could open up other challenges to how large tech companies govern their marketplaces, potentially forcing them to allow alternate payment processors. That could cut into revenue for Google and other companies like Apple and Amazon, which make money by charging fees on any transactions on their platforms.

In summer 2020, Epic had revolted against Apple and Google’s payment-sharing systems for app developers. Epic tweaked its popular Fortnite app so users could pay the company directly. First Apple, then Google, booted Fortnite from their app stores for violating terms. Epic sued both companies, arguing the rules violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.

2024-01-01 19:57:55,Sugamaballz69,"I went through the biggest 1,500 stocks by size one by one and picked out the 248 best. Here's the list:","# LINKS AT BOTTOM

This is not a holy grail list, nor investment advice. It is merely a starting point for those that want a small enough list to go through, filtering out to only consistently growing companies, no stunted/stagnant growth. There is also a list for a further refine into 72 ""most consistent"", and 35 & 38 value stocks currently at a discount from the ""most consistent"" list, but read the disclaimer about this, an expensive stock could stay expensive and vice versa for ""cheap"".

# ***METHODOLOGY:

1. I have analyzed each company blind, meaning I cannot see any information about the underlying stock including but not limited to; ticker, sector, industry, price, etc. This is to help eliminate bias.
2. I am sparingly looking at price movement to discern good companies, I will speak more about this later.
3. I am using 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 4Y, 5Y, 10Y, 15Y, 20Y, 25Y time periods and select periods within each timeframe. Aggregation Periods range from Quarterly to 10Y.
4. The financial metrics I am analyzing; Revenue, Net Earnings, Free Cash Flow, Operating Cash Flow, Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, FCF/Expenses, etc. as well as price/metric for each of these per timeframe.
   1. Using each of the various time periods, I plot a logarithmic/exponential regression of each of these financial metrics. Along with the regression, a correlation coefficient (R\^2) is pulled to measure consistency. and consistency of that consistency over time.
5. Now, the analysis;
   1. The first deal breaker is low revenue growth or negative (which is immediately thrown out). Everything within a company can be stellar but no growth in overall sales is simply unsustainable for true long term growth unless it changes in the future. I am defining low revenue growth as 5% or less, although 10%+ is preferred and ultimately for the most part are the only ones that made it through to the end.
   2. The next filter is every other basic financial metric (EPS, FCF, OCF, BV, etc), is it growing? is the growth consistent (high correlation with the regression). With these the cutoff is minimum 10%+ / year average growth. If any of these don't meet the par, they are tossed.
      1. Income, FCF, Revenue Growth 10%+
      2. Current & Quick Ratio >1
      3. A high FCF/Expenses ratio is very attractive, as it means they have a lot of leftover cash : total expenses. Let's say it's 30%, all else equal they can increase their expenses by 30% (if they spend all their leftover cash) and in turn (all else equal) increase everything by 30% roughly speaking.
      4. And an overall high R\^2 to measure consistency & stability of each.
6. Growth Adjustments:
   1. Price metrics, is their PE growing? Is their PEG growing? these don't dictate wether a stock stays or gets tossed directly, I am only using this to adjust the growth of the stock to fit PE appreciation/depreciation which \*could\* toss out an all around 10%+ growth stock because of consistently depreciating PE.
   2. Dividend Yield, this just turns the above return into total return which can make a significant difference in the case of an average growing company but one that pays a substantial dividend.
7. Full IRR Calculation, for both growth & value:
   1. This is how many years it would take to get a full IRR, rounded up to an upper bound (slower turnaround), given 3 things *this does not fully count stock price appreciation yet, just actual IRR, I will try to workout the equation for that too*:
      1. Intrinsic Growth Rate (CAGR of intrinsic value of company)
      2. PE (EPS as the current point in the regression of the EPS over each timeframe, to help smooth out outlier earnings in an otherwise stabling growing EPS)
      3. PE Growth (Regression of PE over each timeframe, average growth rate then annualized)
      4. I will be adding FCF % of Market Cap to account for buyback potential
   2. The equation is as follows: ---  x=∫₀^(y)  (g + 1)\^y da  ---  x is PE, g is Intrinsic growth rate, y is ""Years to full IRR"". You can access the graph [HERE](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pz4kmefqzw)
8. FOR THE ""MOST CONSISTENT"" index, the methodology is the same as above with much stricter cutoffs; there can't be (if any) periods of stagnant growth over any time frame outlined above, and R\^2 must be fairly high (>0.9) for most financials in general. One great example is FICO (R\^2 of 0.93 for EPS Growth, Revenue Growth @ 0.98, FCF Growth @ 0.98). \~0.95 correlation to a return of 25% yearly growth with 0 volatility, over decades is so hard to accomplish. Even .75 is difficult for most companies to sustain.\*\*\*METHODOLOGY ABOVE\*\*\*

&#x200B;

\*This is not investment advice, I am not a CFA or anything like that to be giving any direct investment advice, this is just my personal list of stocks I believe have good strong consistent growth, however it’s possible for some of them to underperform expectations, just as any stock

Edit: The 248 list is still solid and on the side managed to bring it down to the 72 most consistent, the google sheet & image have been adjusted to also show this last refination(? if that's even a word). this 72 represents the most consistent and noticeable growth in fundamentals and financials over multiple time frames, out of the original 1,500, represents only 4.8% that met those requirements. Interestingly enough, it's almost exactly the 2 STDEV percentile aka. 95% percentile.

EDIT: PART 2; link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18x1w5i/part_2_of_i_went_through_the_biggest_1500_stocks/)

I'll get straight to the point; I went through the entire S&P 500, 400 & 600 (S&P 1500) one by one, looking at each individual company's financials and price accordingly. Refined the list from the base 1,500 to just 248 that had the most consistent growth on; income statements, balance sheets, cash flows, and share price ratios to each respectively. Any companies that showed a recession in growth or a decline in financials were immediately eliminated. The broad index does not discriminate between growing and declining companies, just on size so there's a solid amount of stocks that drawdown the performance of the underlying index, my effort is to ""refine"" the index to only contain consistently growing companies.

I don't have enough time or space to show the analysis of each, and recommend anyone taking this list to research any given company themselves because I am not that qualified to blindly suggest any stocks.

I will organize the list in a readable and easily navigable manner as much as one can for and index of 248 companies.

\*\*In an attempt to take out all biases when picking each stock out, I evaluated them blind (not looking at the ticker or any information that would tell me what the company is, some of the results from this from types of stocks \*not\* chosen and types of stocks that \*were\* chosen to be on the list were slightly surprising and sort of interesting.

disclaimer: I do still own GOOGL/Alphabet, but started backing out of it in early 2022. I would say that between individual stocks and mutual funds it is still 8% of what I own.

  
I'm seeing a downfall of trust with the platform, its draconian limitations on discussing things that are perfectly legal - but that go against Google employees' likes - via Youtube, not to mention the mass criticism of how bad the search function has become (compared to why we all liked the search function years ago).

  
Granted, Alphabet has more going for it than what the common user interfaces with, but it's that lack of trust on so many levels that has me worried about it being as solid of an investing platform in the future. If a person can't trust it to give unbiased search results, or to allow unbiased discussions or how-to videos (of perfectly legal topics) on its video platform, and if one cannot trust it to cease tracking everything one does - what company or country would be foolish enough to trust its highly sensitive data on Alphabet's servers? Who would trust its AI enough to ask it questions?"

Meta is projected to report revenue growth of 22% as the online advertising market continues to recover from a brutal 2022, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates forced brands to reel in spending.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributes advances in artificial intelligence to improvements in the ad business, which is growing faster than rival Google. In Alphabet’s earnings report on Tuesday, the company said Google ad revenue increased 11% from a year earlier, slower expansion than analysts were expecting.

Part of Meta’s financial recovery over the past year was driven by Chinese retailers, which have bolstered spending to reach users across the globe. Meta finance chief Susan Li most recently highlighted the significance of business from China in the company’s third-quarter earnings report in October. Li didn’t name specific companies, but fast-growing upstarts Temu and Shein, which originated in China, have been pouring money into ads on Facebook and Instagram.

While Meta has a very diverse base of advertisers, some analysts say the potential for Temu and Shein to pull back spending poses a risk because every point of growth matters for a company that saw revenue shrink for three straight quarters in 2022.

Zuckerberg, along with the top executives at TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Snap and Discord, faced tough questioning from lawmakers on Wednesday. They accused the Facebook founder of ignoring the severity of child exploitation on the company’s family of apps.

Parents attending the hearing lambasted Meta and other companies for what they allege are insufficient safety and design measures that have caused mental health issues for their children and, in some cases, even resulted in their deaths.

“I’m sorry for everything you’ve all gone through. It’s terrible,” Zuckerberg told the parents in an emotional scene on Capitol Hill. “No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.” 

Investors will also be looking for signs that Meta’s pivot to the metaverse is bearing fruit. The company has been burning billions of dollars a quarter to build out a virtual world that Zuckerberg has said is the future of computing. In total, the division has lost about $25 billion since the beginning of 2022, shortly after Zuckerberg renamed his company.

Analysts expect Reality Labs to show revenue of $762.8 million for the quarter and an operating loss of $4.26 billion, according to StreetAccount.

2024-02-08 08:34:39,Puginator,Google rebrands Bard AI to Gemini and launches a new app and subscription,"Google on Thursday announced a major rebrand of Bard, its artificial intelligence chatbot and assistant, including a fresh app and subscription options. Bard, a chief competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, is now called Gemini, the same name as the suite of AI models that power the chatbot.

Google also announced new ways for consumers to access the AI tool: As of Thursday, Android users can download a new dedicated Android app for Gemini, and iPhone users can use Gemini within the Google app on iOS.

Google’s rebrand and app offerings underline the company’s commitment to pursuing — and investing heavily in — AI assistants or agents, a term often used to describe tools ranging from chatbots to coding assistants and other productivity tools.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the firm’s commitment to AI during the company’s Jan. 30 earnings call. Pichai said he eventually wants to offer an AI agent that can complete more and more tasks on a user’s behalf, including within Google Search, although he said there is “a lot of execution ahead.” Likewise, chief executives at tech giants from Microsoft to Amazon underlined their commitment to building AI agents as productivity tools.

Google’s Gemini changes are a first step to “building a true AI assistant,” Sissie Hsiao, a vice president at Google and general manager for Google Assistant and Bard, told reporters on a call Wednesday.

Google on Thursday also announced a new AI subscription option, for power users who want access to Gemini Ultra 1.0, Google’s most powerful AI model. Access costs $19.99 per month through Google One, the company’s paid storage offering. For existing Google One subscribers, that price includes the storage plans they may already be paying for. There’s also a two-month free trial available.

Thursday’s rollouts are available to users in more than 150 countries and territories, but they’re restricted to the English language for now. Google plans to expand language offerings to include Japanese and Korean soon, as well as other languages.

The Bard rebrand also affects Duet AI, Google’s former name for the “packaged AI agents” within Google Workspace and Google Cloud, which are designed to boost productivity and complete simple tasks for client companies including Wayfair, GE, Spotify and Pfizer. The tools will now be known as Gemini for Workspace and Gemini for Google Cloud.

Google One subscribers who pay for the AI ​​subscription will also have access to Gemini’s assistant capabilities in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides and Meet, executives told reporters Wednesday. Google hopes to incorporate more context into Gemini from users’ content in Gmail, Docs and Drive. For example, if you were responding to a long email thread, suggested responses would eventually take in context from both earlier messages in the thread and potentially relevant files in Google Drive.

As for the reason for the broad name change? Google’s Hsiao told reporters Wednesday that it’s about helping users understand that they’re interacting directly with the AI ​​models that underpin the chatbot.

“Bard [was] the way to talk to our cutting-edge models, and Gemini is our cutting-edge models,” Hsiao said.

Eventually, AI agents could potentially schedule a group hangout by scanning everyone’s calendar to make sure there are no conflicts, book travel and activities, buy presents for loved ones or perform a specific job function such as outbound sales. Currently, though, the tools, including Gemini, are largely limited to tasks such as summarizing, generating to-do lists or helping to write code.

“We will again use generative AI there, particularly with our most advanced models and Bard,” Pichai said on the Jan. 30 earnings call, speaking about Google Assistant and Search. That “allows us to act more like an agent over time, if I were to think about the future and maybe go beyond answers and follow-through for users even more.”

2024-02-14 17:14:14,Puginator,"Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company","Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. It’s the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker’s stock soaring.

Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google’s $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.

The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.

Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.

Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques — such as transformer architecture — used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.

Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a “code red” situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.

Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

2024-02-15 05:25:08,Hanzoisbad,Google (GOOG) DCF Analysis,"**NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**

# Introduction:

GOOG has a very simplistic goal in their business, yet this simple goal managed to carry GOOG's market cap to a trillion dollar. GOOG's main business model is centered around helping consumers sieve through large chunks of data to find what they need or want to find. Recently, with the announcement of Gemini, GOOG's GenAI, it led to a temporary spike in stock prices as investors believed that Gemini would be able to compete with ChatGPT. I believe that the advancement of GenAI is necessary for GOOG given how reliant they are on Search revenue.

# Revenue:

The success of GOOG’s advertising is hinged on 2 criteria, being able to attract and retain users and being able to monetize advertisers.

***For attracting and retaining users,***

1. GOOG released Gemini their generative AI to help complement Search. This allows users to process information faster or seek answers more efficiently.
2. GOOG has entered into a deal with AAPL to make Google the default search engine on Safari. This deal is estimated to be worth about 18 billion per year.
3. There is a large switching cost for long-term users to switch over to a rival search engine. This is so because using the Google search engine means that there is a high chance users will be indoctrinated into the GOOG ecosystem (E.g. Gmail, Google Drive, etc.).

***For monetizing advertisers,***

1. GOOG is one of the largest platforms that advertisers can advertise on. The type of information that users receive is dependent on GOOG, GOOG controls the information flow to consumers and hence is a powerful platform for advertisers to advertise on.

Apart from these factors, GOOG has begun targeting SMBs (Small and Midsize Businesses).

How GOOG sees SMBs (Small, Medium Businesses) advertising with them is that GOOG will provide Gen AI to generate images/captions for their ad campaign then SMBs use these advertising materials and advertise on Search.

When forecasting advertising revenue, opting for less granularity, and due to a lack of public data, I lumped both search and YouTube together. Taking the number of YouTube users as a proxy for the popularity of GOOG’s advertising tools.

So, I assumed that it would take 1 year for GOOG to finish and get Gemini up to speed. I assumed that it takes about 2 years for consumers to get used to Gemini and for advertisers to notice this shift. This quick adaptation is because ChatGPT took off very quickly within the year it was released.

When forecasting revenue/users, due to the macro constraints and pessimism advertisers are cautious about advertising so the revenue/users have been dropping for the past 2 years. I assume it takes 2 years for the macro outlook to improve and during the high growth period, revenue/users grow as well as more advertisers start spending more.

&#x200B;

When forecasting Google Subscriptions + Others, which entails YouTube premium, GOOG devices, and Google Play revenue. I assumed that the success of this category is based on YouTube Premium so I forecasted this revenue segment based on the number of subscribers to YouTube Premium. Number of Subscribers in 2022 ([SOURCE](https://www.billboard.com/business/streaming/youtube-music-premium-subscribers-how-many-1235594920/#:~:text=That's%20up%20from%20the%2080,at%20the%20end%20of%202021)). Comparing Youtube Music to its strongest competitor Spotify, Spotify has a large switching cost due to years worth of playlists built that would be lost by switching over. On top of that, having to learn the new UI of YouTube Music and the lack of certain features that Spotify users are used to.So, the main driver for this segment would be YouTube Premium, given the indispensable nature of YouTube due to the strong network effect and new frontiers such as YouTube Shorts that are driving people to YouTube, and the longer unskippable ads, all these factors are driving people to subscribe to YouTube Premium. However, I’m cautious about how much or how fast YouTube Premium will grow. Due to strong competitors such as TikTok and Spotify, I’d assume the historic large growth will taper downwards as the high historic growth was due to the low-hanging fruits being picked.

&#x200B;

When forecasting Revenue/Users, as GOOG wants to keep their prices low to attract users to YouTube Premium, historically the revenue/users have been declining. However, as recently as July 2023 GOOG started hiking prices. So, I’d assume that in my forecast from FY24 onwards, the Revenue/Users begin rising.  Historic price hikes have been at around 16%, I’d assume that GOOG no longer pursues such aggressive price rises and begins tapering down their price increases. Their perpetual Revenue/users growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.

&#x200B;

When forecasting Google Cloud revenue, since there isn’t available relevant data to create a bottoms-up revenue model I forecasted it as Y/Y growth. Taking into account ([SOURCE](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cloud-computing-industry)). Given that GOOG mainly offers IAAS and SAAS for cloud computing, as businesses begin ramping up their digital efforts in line with the global push towards digitalization there is an increasing demand for IAAS and SAAS cloud computing, especially for IAAS which is stated to have the highest growth rate. I assumed that GOOG’s cloud revenue grew at a Y/Y CAGR of 19.3%.

# Cost:

When forecasting COGS, TAC accounted for about 40% of COGS as per 2023 10-K. I assumed that TAC would tend slightly upwards due to the competition for traffic increasing from competitors such as TikTok.

When forecasting R&D and marketing, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

When forecasting G&A, management has stated that there is a potential usage of AI to reduce the need for labor. I’d assume that G&A tends downward slightly.

Conclusion:

Ultimately, in my base case, I value GOOG at $143.16 per share. I believe that GOOG is a company with strong growth potential. However, given that GOOG is a household name and especially with the recent hype when they announced gemini it has led to a lot of enthusiasm and bullish outlook that caused their prices to temporarily spike upwards.

2024-02-22 13:28:17,Puginator,Reddit files to list IPO on NYSE under the ticker RDDT,"Social media company Reddit filed its IPO prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday after a yearslong run-up. The company plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “RDDT.”

Its market debut, expected in March, will mark the first major tech initial public offering of the year. It’s the first social media IPO since Pinterest went public in 2019.

Reddit first filed a confidential draft of its public offering prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2021.

The social media company, founded in 2005 by technology entrepreneurs Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, has raised about $1.3 billion in funding and has a post valuation of $10 billion, according to deal-tracking service PitchBook.

Publishing giant Condé Nast bought Reddit in 2006 and then spun it out as an independent company in 2011.

As of October, Reddit had 70 million daily active users and over 100,000 active communities, or subreddits, according to its corporate website. Reddit is one of the most-visited websites in the U.S., according to analytics firm Semrush, but it has struggled to build an online advertising business comparable to tech giants like Facebook-parent Meta and Google-parent Alphabet.

It’s also faced challenges with developers and moderators.

In June, several prominent Reddit moderators locked subreddits as part of a blackout to protest the company’s decision to increase the price third-party developers pay to use its application programming interface, or API. At the time, Reddit said the pricing change was necessary because many big tech companies were using data to train large language models.

2024-03-01 19:30:14,Big_Forever5759,Google in Crisis,"https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/inside-the-crisis-at-google


It’s not like artificial intelligence caught Sundar Pichai off guard. I remember sitting in the audience in January 2018 when the Google CEO said it was as profound as electricity and fire. His proclamation stunned the San Francisco audience that day, so bullish it still seems a bit absurd, and it underscores how bizarre it is that his AI strategy now appears unmoored.

The latest AI crisis at Google — where its Gemini image and text generation tool produced insane responses, including portraying Nazis as people of color — is now spiraling into the worst moment of Pichai’s tenure. Morale at Google is plummeting, with one employee telling me it’s the worst he’s ever seen. And more people are calling for Pichai’s ouster than ever before. Even the relatively restrained Ben Thompson of Stratechery demanded his removal on Monday. 


Yet so much — too much — coverage of Google’s Gemini incident views it through the culture war lens. For many, Google either caved to wokeness or cowed to those who’d prefer not to address AI bias. These interpretations are wanting, and frankly incomplete explanations for why the crisis escalated to this point. The culture war narrative gives too much credit to Google for being a well organized, politics-driven machine. And the magnitude of the issue runs even deeper than Gemini’s skewed responses. 

There’s now little doubt that Google steered its users’ Gemini prompts by adding words that pushed the outputs toward diverse responses — forgetting when not to ask for diversity, like with the Nazis — but the way those added words got there is the real story. Even employees on Google’s Trust and Safety team are puzzled by where exactly the words came from, a product of Google scrambling to set up a Gemini unit without clear ownership of critical capabilities. And a reflection of the lack of accountability within some parts of Google.

""Organizationally at this place, it's impossible to navigate and understand who's in rooms and who owns things,” one member of Google’s Trust and Safety team told me. “Maybe that's by design so that nobody can ever get in trouble for failure.”

Organizational dysfunction is still common within Google, something it’s worked to fix through recent layoffs, and it showed up in the formation of its Gemini team. Moving fast while chasing OpenAI and Microsoft, Google gave its Product, Trust and Safety, and Responsible AI teams input into the training and release of Gemini. And their coordination clearly wasn’t good enough. In his letter to Google employees addressing the Gemini debacle this week, Pichai singled out “structural changes” as a remedy to prevent a repeat, acknowledging the failure.

Those structural changes may turn into a significant rework of how the organization operates. “The problem is big enough that replacing a single leader or merging just two teams probably won’t cut it,” the Google Trust and Safety employee said.

Already, Google is rushing to fix some of the deficiencies that contributed to the mess. On Friday, a ‘reset’ day Google, and through the weekend — when Google employees almost never work — the company’s Trust and Safety leadership called for volunteers to test Gemini’s outputs to prevent further blunders. “We need multiple volunteers on stand-by per time block so we can activate rapid adversarial testing on high priority topics,” one executive wrote in an internal email. 

And as the crisis brewed internally, it escalated externally when Google shared the same type of opaque public statements and pledges about doing better that have worked for its core products. That underestimated how different the public’s relationship is with generative AI than other technology, and made matters worse. 

Unlike search, which points you to the web, generative AI is the core experience, not a route elsewhere. Using a generative tool like Gemini is a tradeoff. You get the benefit of a seemingly-magical product. But you give up control. While you may get answers quickly, or a cool looking graphic, you lose touch with the source material. To use it means putting more trust in giant companies like Google, and to maintain that trust Google needs to be extremely transparent. Yet what do we really know about how its models operate? Continuing on as it if were business as usual, Google contributed to the magnitude of the crisis.

Now, some close to Google are starting to ask if it’s focused in the right places, coming back to Pichai’s strategic plan. Was it really necessary, for instance, for Google to build a $20 per month chatbot, when it could simply imbue its existing technology — including Gmail, Docs, and its Google Home smart speakers — with AI?

There are all worthwhile questions, and the open wondering about Pichai’s job is fair, but the current wave of Generative AI is still so early that Google has time to adjust. On Friday, for instance, Elon Musk sued OpenAI for betraying its founding agreement, a potential setback for the company’s main competitor.

Google, which just released a powerful Gemini 1.5 model, will have at least a few more shots until a true moment for panic sets in. But everyone within the company knows it can’t afford many more of the previous week’s incidents, from Pichai to the workers pulling shifts this weekend.

2024-03-03 16:11:54,divine-intervention7,Is Google’s Waymo potential underrated?,"It seems to me that among the recent Gemini headlines (which I find personally quite overblown, as Meta’s very advanced AI displayed the same flaws, and Microsoft’s Copilot was shown to display some real nonsense as well), people have kind of lost track of the autonomous vehicle business. 

Waymo is by far the most advanced technology of all autonomous vehicle companies in existence. I’m not sure if people are fully aware that Waymo already has a commercial driverless taxi service in operation. I haven’t tried it but watched videos and it seems to work amazingly well. People love to nitpick autonomous vehicles and say “oh x and y are not working perfectly well”, but let’s be real, human taxi drivers are far from perfect and the service seems to be working far, far better than the average taxi driver. This week, Waymo received approval to run their commercial service in Los Angeles. 

While most carmakers dabble in their own autonomous driving technology, many of them also have collaborations with Waymo. I see real potential for Waymo to become the de facto provider for most carmakers - the way that for years, many parallel charging networks existed, and very suddenly the majority of carmakers signed on to Tesla’s solution as the dominos kept falling one after the other. 

With all the news around ChatGPT, most investors seem to use “AI” interchangeably with “chatbot” or more generally “LLM” or “image generation”. But autonomous driving is in fact AI as well.

Google also owns Deepmind which has been at the absolute cutting edge for AI for many years now. I feel like most people overlook this because you can’t just go to Deepmind.com and have a conversation with their AI. But they are doing some incredibly advanced stuff in scientific fields. Monetizing all of that is going to be a different story but I feel that from a technology standpoint, Google is very much doing impressive things:

The 50-0 vote represents the most significant momentum for a U.S. crackdown on TikTok, which has about 170 million U.S. users, which had stalled over the last year amid heavy lobbying by the company.

Lawmakers hope to move quickly on the measure and said the U.S. House of Representatives could take up the bill in the coming weeks.

""This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States,"" the company said after the vote. ""The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression. This will damage millions of businesses, deny artists an audience, and destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country.""
Before the vote, lawmakers got a closed-door classified briefing on national security concerns about TikTok's Chinese ownership.

The bill would give ByteDance 165 days to divest TikTok; if it did not, app stores operated by Apple, Google, and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications.

2024-03-08 07:31:06,Puginator,HelloFresh shares dive 42% after meal kit giant warns on outlook,"HelloFresh shares plunged 42% on Friday morning in their worst-ever session to date, after the recipe box delivery company disappointed with its 2024 earnings outlook.

Analysts at UBS said that while they had flagged risks around HelloFresh’s guidance, its outlook, released after the market close on Thursday, was “far worse” than anticipated. Disappointing growth and adjusted earnings forecasts indicated elevated customer acquisition costs are “expected to persist in 2024,” they said in a note.

Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, called the outlook for 2024 “disappointing” and noted the removal of its previously announced targets for 2025, which the company attributed to a “very different operating environment.”

The Berlin-based firm on Thursday said it expected adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to come in at 448 million euros ($480 million) for fiscal 2023, down from 477 million euros the year before. 

It also revealed it expects adjusted EBITDA in 2024 to fall to between 350 million and 400 million euros, despite a forecast for higher revenue from the North American market.

The lower earnings will be due to increased production capacity and marketing expenses, and a ramp-up of two new fulfillment centers, the company said.

Its annual results are due to be released on Mar. 15.

HelloFresh listed in Frankfurt in 2017 and proved a clear pandemic beneficiary, with shares climbing rapidly as investors spied opportunities in tech platforms providing door-to-door services.

But its value has tumbled since its peak in 2021, with shares down 70% in 2022 and down 30% in 2023.

According to Bloomberg, there are “active negotiations to let Apple license Gemini, Google’s set of generative AI models, to power some new features coming to the iPhone software this year.” Apple has also talked with OpenAI, which powers Microsoft’s AI capabilities.
Apple is specifically looking to partner on cloud-based generative AI, with today’s report citing text and image generation as examples of what Gemini could be used for. At the same time, Apple is working on offering its own on-device AI models and capabilities with the upcoming iOS 18 release.
The discussions are still underway, and it’s unclear how the AI agreement will be branded. This would be a significant expansion of the existing relationship — default search engine — between the two companies.
Looking at the rest of the industry, Google announced a partnership with Samsung in February to have Gemini power summarization features in the Galaxy S24’s notes and voice recording apps, as well as keyboard. Samsung is also using Imagen 2 text-to-image diffusion for a generative editing feature in the photo gallery app. Those features all require server-side processing, but Samsung is also using an on-device version of Gemini.
Google offers Gemini in three sizes, with Pro being used by most first and third-party apps. Gemini 1.0 Pro powers the free version of gemini.google.com, while 1.0 Ultra is used in the paid Gemini Advanced tier."
2024-03-18 13:31:19,Puginator,Nvidia announces Blackwell AI chips that will launch later this year,"Nvidia on Monday announced a new generation of artificial intelligence chips and software for running AI models. The announcement, made during Nvidia’s developer’s conference in San Jose, comes as the chipmaker seeks to solidify its position as the go-to supplier for AI companies.

Nvidia’s share price is up five-fold and total sales have more than tripled since OpenAI’s ChatGPT kicked off the AI boom in late 2022. Nvidia’s high-end server GPUs are essential for training and deploying large AI models. Companies like Microsoft and Meta have spent billions of dollars buying the chips.

The new generation of AI graphics processors is named Blackwell. The first Blackwell chip is called the GB200 and will ship later this year. Nvidia is enticing its customers with more powerful chips to spur new orders. Companies and software makers, for example, are still scrambling to get their hands on the current generation of H100s and similar chips.

“Hopper is fantastic, but we need bigger GPUs,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Monday at the company’s developer conference in San Jose, California. “Let me introduce you to a very big GPU.”

The company also introduced revenue-generating software called NIM that will make it easier to deploy AI, giving customers another reason to stick with Nvidia chips over a rising field of competitors.

Nvidia executives say that the company is becoming less of a mercenary chip provider and more of a platform provider, like Microsoft or Apple, on which other companies can build software.

“The sellable commercial product was the GPU and the software was all to help people use the GPU in different ways,” said Nvidia enterprise VP Manuvir Das in an interview. “Of course, we still do that. But what’s really changed is, we really have a commercial software business now.”

Das said Nvidia’s new software will make it easier to run programs on any of Nvidia’s GPUs, even older ones that might be better suited for deploying but not building AI.

“If you’re a developer, you’ve got an interesting model you want people to adopt, if you put it in a NIM, we’ll make sure that it’s runnable on all our GPUs, so you reach a lot of people,” Das said.

Every two years Nvidia updates its GPU architecture, unlocking a big jump in performance. Many of the AI models released over the past year were trained on the company’s Hopper architecture — used by chips such as the H100 — which was announced in 2022.

Nvidia says Blackwell-based processors, like the GB200, offer a huge performance upgrade for AI companies, with 20 petaflops in AI performance versus 4 petaflops for the H100. The additional processing power will enable AI companies to train bigger and more intricate models, Nvidia said.

The chip includes what Nvidia calls a “transformer engine specifically built to run transformers-based AI, one of the core technologies underpinning ChatGPT.

The Blackwell GPU is large and combines two separately manufactured dies into one chip manufactured by TSMC. It will also be available as an entire server called the GB200 NVLink 2, combining 72 Blackwell GPUs and other Nvidia parts designed to train AI models.

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle will sell access to the GB200 through cloud services. The GB200 pairs two B200 Blackwell GPUs with one Arm-based Grace CPU. Nvidia said Amazon Web Services would build a server cluster with 20,000 GB200 chips.

Nvidia said that the system can deploy a 27-trillion-parameter model. That’s much larger than even the biggest models, such as GPT-4, which reportedly has 1.7 trillion parameters. Many artificial intelligence researchers believe bigger models with more parameters and data could unlock new capabilities.

Nvidia didn’t provide a cost for the new GB200 or the systems it’s used in. Nvidia’s Hopper-based H100 costs between $25,000 and $40,000 per chip, with whole systems that cost as much as $200,000, according to analyst estimates.

Nvidia also announced it’s adding a new product named NIM to its Nvidia enterprise software subscription.

NIM makes it easier to use older Nvidia GPUs for inference, or the process of running AI software, and will allow companies to continue to use the hundreds of millions of Nvidia GPUs they already own. Inference requires less computational power than the initial training of a new AI model. NIM enables companies that want to run their own AI models, instead of buying access to AI results as a service from companies like OpenAI.

The strategy is to get customers who buy Nvidia-based servers to sign up for Nvidia enterprise, which costs $4,500 per GPU per year for a license.

Nvidia will work with AI companies like Microsoft or Hugging Face to ensure their AI models are tuned to run on all compatible Nvidia chips. Then, using a NIM, developers can efficiently run the model on their own servers or cloud-based Nvidia servers without a lengthy configuration process.

“In my code, where I was calling into OpenAI, I will replace one line of code to point it to this NIM that I got from Nvidia instead,” Das said.

Nvidia says the software will also help AI run on GPU-equipped laptops, instead of on servers in the cloud.

2024-03-21 07:32:53,Puginator,DOJ sues Apple over iPhone monopoly,"The Department of Justice sued Apple on Thursday, saying its iPhone ecosystem is a monopoly that drove its “astronomical valuation” at the expense of consumers, developers and rival phone makers.

Federal antitrust enforcement and 17 attorneys general also say that Apple’s anti-competitive practices extend beyond the iPhone and Apple Watch businesses, citing Apple’s advertising, browser, FaceTime and news offerings.

“Each step in Apple’s course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly,” the complaint filed in the District of New Jersey said. Apple shares were down around 1.8% as investors anticipated the lawsuit.

The Justice Department said in a release that to keep consumers buying iPhones, Apple moved to block cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party wallet and smartwatch compatibility and disrupted non-App Store programs and cloud-streaming services.

The challenge represents a significant risk to Apple’s walled-garden business model. The company says that complying with regulations costs the company money, could prevent it from introducing new products or services, and could hurt customer demand.

The lawsuit could force Apple to make changes in some of its most valuable businesses: The iPhone, in which Apple reported over $200 billion in sales in 2023, the Apple Watch, part of the company’s $40 billion wearables business, and its profitable services line, which reported $85 billion in revenue.

“If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the release.

Apple said in a statement that it disagreed with the premise of the lawsuit and that it would defend against it.

“This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect,” an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. “It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”

The lawsuit follows years of investigations into Apple’s business practices and two prior DOJ cases against Apple: One over e-book prices and another over allegations that it colluded with other technology companies to depress salaries.

“This anticompetitive behavior is designed to maintain Apple’s monopoly power while extracting as much revenue as possible,” the complaint said.

iMessage, Apple Watch, and cloud gaming

The complaint highlights comments from CEO Tim Cook and other executives. Some users have asked Apple to improve Android-to-iPhone messaging. Developers have gone as far as creating apps that can circumvent the platform limitations, only to be shut down by Apple.

Prosecutors highlighted one exchange between Cook and a consumer.

“Not to make it personal but I can’t send my mom certain videos,” the complaint says one user told Cook, referring to a 2022 interview at a Vox Media event.

“Buy your mom an iPhone,” Cook responded.

The DOJ is also focusing on Apple’s smartwatch, Apple Watch, saying the company designed it to only work with iPhones, and not Android devices. The company’s decision means that “users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones,” according to the complaint.

The DOJ said Apple has fought cloud streaming services on its App Store platform, blocking consumer access to high-quality video games on iPhones, echoing complaints from Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta.

Apple has faced several significant antitrust challenges more recently, largely focused on its control over the iPhone App Store. It mostly won in a civil suit against Epic Games in 2021, although it made concessions during the trial and had to make some changes to its policies under California law.

“Today’s lawsuit seeks to hold Apple accountable and ensure it cannot deploy the same, unlawful playbook in other vital markets,” Assistant Attorney General for antitrust Jonathan Kanter said in the release.

The company is currently jockeying with the European Commission over whether it’s complying with a new Digital Markets Act, which forces Apple to open up the iPhone app store to rivals such as Microsoft or Epic Games. Apple plans to charge big companies that eschew its app store 50 cents per download.

Apple was fined $2 billion in the EU over a dispute with Spotify about whether the music streaming service can link to its website and account system inside of its app.

Apple had 64% of the market share for U.S. iPhones in the last quarter of 2023, versus 18% for Samsung, according to Counterpoint Research.

Apple isn’t the only big tech company facing government scrutiny. The DOJ filed an antitrust case against Google in 2020 over its dominant search position and another year over its advertising business. The DOJ also famously sued Microsoft in the 1990s, eventually forcing it to allow users to unbundle the Internet Explorer browser from the Windows operating system.

2024-03-21 10:20:38,Puginator,Reddit pops 38% in NYSE debut to open at $47 per share,"Reddit shares jumped 38% on Thursday to open at $47 in the first initial public offering for a major social media company since Pinterest’s debut in 2019.

The 19-year-old website that hosts millions of online forums priced its IPO on Wednesday at $34 a share, the top of the expected range. Reddit and selling shareholders raised about $750 million from the offering, with the company collecting about $519 million.

Trading under the ticker symbol “RDDT,” Reddit is testing investor appetite for new tech stocks after an extended dry spell for IPOs. Since the peak of the technology boom in late 2021, hardly any venture-backed tech companies have gone public and those that have — like Instacart and Klaviyo last year — have underwhelmed. On Wednesday, data center hardware company Astera Labs made its public market debut on Nasdaq and saw its shares soar 72%, underscoring investor excitement over businesses tied to the boom in artificial intelligence.

Reddit is taking a haircut from its private market valuation of $10 billion in 2021, a boom year for the tech industry. The mood changed a year later, however, when investors became concerned over rising interest rates and soaring inflation and exited high-risk assets. In response, startups conducted layoffs, trimmed their valuations, and shifted focus to profit over growth.

Reddit’s annual sales for 2023 rose 20% to $804 million from $666.7 million a year earlier, the company detailed in its prospectus. The company recorded a net loss of $90.8 million last year, narrower than its loss of $158.6 million in 2022.

Based on its revenue over the past four quarters, Reddit’s $6.5 billion market cap at IPO gives it a price-to-sales ratio of about 8. Alphabet trades for 6.1 times revenue, Meta has a multiple of 9.7, Pinterest’s sits at 7.5 and Snap trades for 3.9 times sales, according to FactSet.

In addition to those companies, Reddit also counts X, Discord, Wikipedia and Amazon’s Twitch streaming service as competitors in its prospectus.

Reddit is betting that data licensing could become a major source of revenue, and said in its filing that it’s entered “certain data licensing arrangements with an aggregate contract value of $203.0 million and terms ranging from two to three years.” This year, Reddit said it plans to recognize roughly $66.4 million in revenue as part of its data licensing deals.

Google has also entered into an expanded partnership with Reddit, allowing the search giant to obtain more access to Reddit data to train AI models and improve its products.

Reddit revealed on March 15 that the Federal Trade Commission is conducting a non-public inquiry “focused on our sale, licensing, or sharing of user-generated content with third parties to train AI models.” Reddit said it was “not surprised that the FTC has expressed interest” in the company’s data licensing practices related to AI, and that it doesn’t believe that it has “engaged in any unfair or deceptive trade practice.”

Reddit was founded in 2005 by technology entrepreneurs Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, the company’s CEO. Existing stakeholders, including Huffman, sold a combined 6.7 million shares in the IPO.

As part of the IPO, Reddit gave some of its top moderators and users, known as Redditors, a chance to buy stock through a directed-share program. Companies like Airbnb, Doximity and Rivian have used similar programs to reward their power users and customers.

“I hope they believe in Reddit and support Reddit,” Huffman told CNBC in an interview on Thursday. “But  the goal is just to get them in the deal. Just like any professional investor.”

Redditors have expressed skepticism about the IPO, both because of the company’s financials and its often troubled relationship with moderators. Huffman said he recognizes that reality and acknowledged the controversial subreddit Wallstreetbets, which helped spawn the boom in meme stocks like GameStop.

“That’s the beautiful thing about Reddit, is that they tell it like it is,” Huffman said. “But you have to remember they’re doing that on Reddit. It’s a platform they love, it’s their home on the internet.”

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is one of Reddit’s major shareholders along with Tencent and Advance Magazine Publishers, the parent company of publishing giant Condé Nast. Altman’s stake in the company was worth over $400 million before the stock began trading. Altman led a $50 million funding round into Reddit in 2014 and was a member of its board from 2015 through 2022.

2024-03-28 08:24:03,Puginator,Xiaomi releases electric car $4K cheaper than Tesla's Model 3 as price wars heat up,"Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi said Thursday it will sell its first car for far less than Tesla’s Model 3, as price wars heat up in China’s fiercely competitive electric car market.

Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said the standard version of the SU7 will sell for 215,900 yuan ($30,408) in the country — a price he acknowledged would mean the company was selling each car at a loss.

Tesla’s Model 3 starts at 245,900 yuan in China.

Lei claimed the standard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its specifications, except on two aspects that he said it might take Xiaomi at least three to five years to catch up with Tesla on. He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3′s 606 kilometers. The company said orders had exceeded 50,000 cars in the 27 minutes since sales started at 10 p.m. Beijing time Thursday.

Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, Lei said. Lei also claimed that Xiaomi’s car factory, for which all “key” steps are fully automated, can produce an SU7 every 76 seconds. It was not immediately clear whether the factory was fully operational.

Earlier this week, the Xiaomi CEO said on social media the SU7 would be the best sedan “under 500,000 yuan” ($69,328).

The car is entering a fiercely competitive market in China, where companies are launching a slew of new models and cutting prices in order to survive. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has partnered with traditional automakers, most notably launching the Aito brand whose vehicles are often on display in Huawei smartphone showrooms.

Tesla’s Model 3 is the best-selling new energy sedan in China that has a driving range of at least 600 kilometers (372 miles) and costs less than 500,000 yuan, according to data from industry website Autohome.

BYD’s Han sedan starts at 169,800 yuan, according to Autohome.

Nio’s ET5 starts at 298,000 yuan, while Xpeng’s P7 starts at 209,900 yuan, the data showed. Geely-owned Zeekr’s 007 sedan starts at 209,900 yuan, according to Autohome.

Sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery-only powered cars, have surged in China to account for about one-third of new passenger cars sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association.

Accessories

The heads of competing electric car startups Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto were among the featured guests at the Xiaomi SU7 launch event.

Lei on Thursday showed off a range of accessories such as an in-car refrigerator, a custom front-window shade, and a smartphone holder, some available for free with a car purchase before the end of April, and others for a separate price.

The SU7 supports Apple’s Car Play and can integrate with the iPad, Lei said. He also revealed driver-assist tech for highways and cities, set to be fully available in China in August.

Tesla’s Autopilot for driver assist on highways is available in China, but the company’s “Full Self Driving” for city streets has yet to be released in the country.

Despite saying Xiaomi wanted to compete with Porsche at a car tech event in December, Lei acknowledged that the SU7 had longer to go before it might be able to compete at this more premium level. He announced that the “Max” version of the SU7, aimed as a competitor with Porsche’s Taycan, would sell for 299,900 yuan.

Ecosystem of devices

The SU7 is part of Xiaomi’s recently launched “Human x Car x Home” strategy that seeks to build an ecosystem of devices connected to its new HyperOS operating system. Most of the company’s revenue is from phones, with just under 30% coming from appliances and other consumer products.

Although Xiaomi is generally known for more affordable products, its President Lu Weibing told CNBC earlier this year the company has been pursuing a premiumization strategy since 2020 — and that there are about 20 million users in that price segment who might buy the SU7.

Lu told CNBC that the SU7 will first be sold to consumers in China, and that it would take at least two to three years for any overseas launch.

The company showed off the car at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in late February, following a reveal of the vehicle’s exterior and tech in Beijing in late December.

2024-04-09 07:20:44,FarrisAT,Google Launches AI Video-Creation Tool Google Vids,"https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/ai-google-vids-alphabet-stock-761e7e35?mod=mw_quote_news

Google made a series of announcements this morning, including introduced a new artificial-intelligence-powered video-creation tool called Google Vids, targeted at making it easier for marketing and advertising pros to write, produce and edit videos. 

The company made that announcement—and myriad others—at the start of its Google Cloud Next customer event, which will take place over the next three days in Las Vegas.

Google also made some announcements about its growing set of in-house designed semiconductors. In particular, the company unveiled Google Axion, a new Arm-based CPU for the datacenter. Google said Axion will deliver 50% better performance and 60% better energy efficiency than comparable current-generation x86-based cloud processors. Google said Axion will provide 30% better performance versus other current Arm-based instances in the cloud.

Shares of Google-parent Alphabet were up 2.2% in Tuesday morning trading.

Google also said that the most powerful version of its TPU processors for AI training and inference applications, known as TPU v5p, has become generally available via Google Cloud."
2024-04-09 11:10:26,Puginator,Google unveils custom Arm-based chips ,"Google is trying to make cloud computing more affordable with a custom-built Arm-based server chip. At its Cloud Next conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, the company said the new processor will become available later in 2024.

With the new Arm-based chip, Google is playing catch-up with rivals such as Amazon and Microsoft, which have been employing a similar strategy for years. The tech giants compete fiercely in the growing market for cloud infrastructure, where organizations rent out resources in faraway data centers and pay based on usage.

Google parent Alphabet still derives three-quarters of revenue from advertising, but cloud is growing faster and now represents almost 11% of company revenue. The segment, which contains corporate productivity applications, is also profitable. Google held 7.5% of the cloud infrastructure market in 2022, while Amazon and Microsoft together controlled around 62%, according to Gartner estimates.

Market leader Amazon Web Services introduced its Graviton Arm chip in 2018. “Almost all their services are already ported and optimized on the Arm ecosystem,” Chirag Dekate, an analyst at technology industry researcher Gartner, told CNBC in an interview. Graviton has picked up business from Datadog, Elastic, Snowflake and Sprinklr, among others.

Alibaba announced Arm processors in 2021, and Microsoft did the same in November.

Arm isn’t completely new to Google, which started selling access to virtual machines, or VMs, that use Oracle-backed startup Ampere’s Arm-based chips earlier this year.

Porting applications to Arm machines has made sense for organizations seeking to reduce spending on cloud computing because of economic worries. When Arm Holdings filed to go public last year, it pointed to Amazon’s claim that Graviton could give up to 40% better price performance than comparable server instances, such as the common “x86” model used by AMD and Intel processors.

Google has used Arm-based server computers for internal purposes to run YouTube advertising, the BigTable and Spanner databases, and the BigQuery data analytics tool. The company will gradually move them over to the cloud-based Arm instances, which are named Axion, when they become available, a spokesperson said.

Datadog and Elastic plan to adopt Axion, along with OpenX and Snap, the spokesperson said.

Broader use of chips drawing on Arm’s architecture might lead to lower carbon emissions for certain workloads. Virtual slices of physical servers containing the Axion chips deliver 60% more energy efficiency than comparable VMs based on the x86 model, Google cloud chief Thomas Kurian wrote in a blog post. Arm chips, which are popular in smartphones, offer a shorter set of instructions than x86 chips, which are commonly found in PCs.

The chips can also speed up applications.

Axion offers 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based virtual machines in the cloud and 50% better performance than comparable VMs based on x86, Google said.

“I think it completes their portfolio,” Dekate said.

2024-04-11 04:22:18,Puginator,Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says he's committed to cost cutting while investing in AI in shareholder letter,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday published his annual shareholder letter, where he pledged to keep looking for ways to keep costs in check even as the company doubles down on investing in new growth areas like artificial intelligence.

“I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one of our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers’ lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we’re investing,” Jassy wrote in his third shareholder letter since taking the helm at Amazon from former CEO Jeff Bezos, who stepped down in 2021.

Under Jassy, Amazon has morphed into a leaner version of itself, as slowing sales and a challenging economy pushed the company to eschew the relentless growth of the Bezos years. Beginning at the end of 2022 and continuing through 2023, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs. Those cuts have continued this year, with Amazon announcing layoffs in its cloud computing, Prime Video and Twitch livestreaming units, among others.

Even amid a period of retrenchment in some areas, Jassy said he’s focused on finding new areas of growth within the company so that Amazon remains “resilient.” He stressed the importance of building “primitive services,” which he described as “discrete, foundational building blocks” that can spur new projects and businesses.

Jassy used Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division, as an example. Before he became Amazon’s CEO, Jassy oversaw the creation of AWS, which grew from an internal tool to become the dominant cloud service and one of Amazon’s most profitable businesses.

He said he believes generative artificial intelligence stands to be Amazon’s next “primitive service” that could transform the company. “We’re optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,” Jassy wrote.

Amazon on Thursday added Andrew Ng, a renowned AI pioneer who previously led Google Brain and was a scientist at Baidu, to its board. Ng will replace Judy McGrath, who has sat on the board since 2014.

In the past year, Amazon has made a flurry of AI announcements as the field exploded, causing tech companies to pour money into the space. Last month, Amazon added $2.75 billion to its stake in AI startup Anthropic in its largest venture investment yet. Jassy has also pledged to infuse AI into every one of Amazon’s businesses.

2024-04-15 13:15:02,Puginator,Tesla execs Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel depart as company announces layoffs,"Tesla executives Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel announced Monday they are leaving the electric vehicle maker and clean energy company. CEO Elon Musk thanked both departing execs on X, the social network he owns and runs as chief technology officer.

The news comes after Tesla said it is laying off more than 10% of its workforce.

Baglino had worked with Tesla since its early years, starting as a firmware and electrical engineer in 2006. He most recently reported directly to Musk as the company’s senior vice president for powertrain and energy engineering.

Patel joined Tesla in 2016 after working as a senior advisor to former President Barack Obama on climate and energy issues, among other policy matters.

Reuters recently reported that Tesla has set aside plans to make a more affordable new EV at Musk’s direction. The strategy shift includes a greater focus on developing a “robotaxi” and comes amid steep competition including from BYD and other Chinese automakers with more affordable electric cars.

Patel and Baglino had been deeply involved in battery and vehicle manufacturing, related policy, and turning Tesla into a multinational EV manufacturer. They were less involved in autonomous vehicle technology at Tesla. 

Baglino wrote in a post on X:

“I made the difficult decision to move on from Tesla after 18 years yesterday. I am so thankful to have worked with and learned from the countless incredibly talented people at Tesla over the years. I loved tackling nearly every problem we solved as a team and feel gratified to have contributed to the mission of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy, a mission that I am quite passionate about.”

Musk responded on the platform, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Few have contributed as much as you.”

As of Monday morning, Tesla had not yet updated the “leadership” information on its corporate webpage to reflect Baglino’s departure.

Patel wrote in a post on the social network, “The past 8 years at Tesla have been filled with every emotion — but the feeling I have today is utmost gratitude,” adding, “My immigrant parents worked their asses off and as a result I’m the luckiest dude. Lucky to have been a part of @BarackObama’s campaign/administration, and truly honored to have worked at @Tesla to positively changing multiple industries.”

Musk replied to Patel, saying, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Much appreciated.”

The CEO also said, in a post on X on Monday, “About every 5 years, we need to reorganize and streamline the company for the next phase of growth.”

Baglino and Patel were not immediately available for comment.

2024-04-29 20:26:01,Puginator,"Google lays off staff from Flutter, Dart and Python teams weeks before its developer conference","Ahead of Google’s annual I/O developer conference in May, the tech giant has laid off staff across key teams like Flutter, Dart, Python and others, according to reports from affected employees shared on social media. Google confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch, but not the specific teams, roles or how many people were let go.

“As we’ve said, we’re responsibly investing in our company’s biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead,” said Google spokesperson Alex García-Kummert. “To best position us for these opportunities, throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers, and align their resources to their biggest product priorities. Through this, we’re simplifying our structures to give employees more opportunity to work on our most innovative and important advances and our biggest company priorities, while reducing bureaucracy and layers,” he added.

The company clarified that the layoffs were not company-wide but were reorgs that are part of the normal course of business. Affected employees will be able to apply for other open roles at Google, we’re told.

In one X post, a PM from Flutter and Dart said the layoffs had affected “a LOT of teams,” and that “lots of great projects lost people.”

“We’re sad, but still cranking hard on I/O and beyond,” wrote Google PM Kevin Moore in the Flutter development community on Reddit, where he added that Flutter and Dart weren’t affected any more or less than other teams. “We know ya’ll care SO MUCH about the project and the team and the awesome ecosystem we’ve built together. You’re nervous. I get it. We get it. You’re betting on Flutter and Dart. So am I. So is Google,” he said.

Google also told TechCrunch that Flutter will have new updates to share at I/O this year.

In a separate post on Reddit, another commenter noted the Python team affected by the layoffs were those who managed the internal Python runtimes and toolchains and worked with OSS Python. Included in this group were “multiple current and former core devs and steering council members,” they said.

Meanwhile, others shared on Y Combinator’s Hacker News, where a Python team member detailed their specific duties on the technical front and noted that, for years, much of the work was done with fewer than 10 people. Another Hacker News commenter said their early years on the Python team were spent paying down internal technical debt accumulated from not having a strong Python strategy.

“[D]espite the understaffing, we had managers who were extremely good about maintaining work/life balance and the ‘marathon, not sprint’ approach to work. As I said in another comment, it’s the best job I’ve ever had, and I’ll miss it deeply,” they wrote.

“Python was one of the very first languages used widely at Google. It was the last major backend language to get a language team,” the user, gpshead, also said.

Though Google didn’t detail headcount, some of the layoffs at Google may have been confirmed in a WARN notice filed on April 24. WARN, or the California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, requires employers with more than 100 employees to provide 60-day notice in advance of layoffs. In the filing, Google said it was laying off a total of 50 employees across three locations in Sunnyvale.

On social media, commenters raised concerns with the Python layoffs in particular, given the role that Python tooling plays in AI. But others pointed out that Google didn’t eliminate its Python team; it replaced that team with another group based in Munich — at least according to Python Steering Council member Thomas Wouters in a post on Mastodon last Thursday.

“It’s a tough day when everyone you work with directly, including your manager, is laid off — excuse me, ‘had their roles reduced,’ and you’re asked to onboard their replacements, people told to take those very same roles just in a different country who are not any happier about it,” he said.

Google said it would support all affected employees, in line with local requirements, by providing them with time to search for different roles at Google or elsewhere, access to outplacement services and severance.

2024-04-29 22:52:54,Putaineska,FT: Apple targets Google staff to build secret artificial intelligence team,"Financial Times analysis of hundreds of LinkedIn profiles as well as public job postings and research papers reveals that Apple has poached dozens of staff from Google in recent years to expand its global AI and Machine Learning team. The iPhone maker has attracted at least 36 specialists from its rival since it hired John Giannandrea to be its top AI executive in 2018.

Apple has also created a secretive European laboratory in Zurich. Professor Luc Van Gool from Swiss university ETH Zurich said Apple’s acquisitions of two local AI start-ups — virtual reality group FaceShift and image recognition company Fashwell — led Apple to build a research laboratory, known as its “Vision Lab”, in the city.

Industry insiders suggest Apple is focused on deploying generative AI on its mobile devices, a breakthrough that would allow AI chatbots and apps to run on the phone’s own hardware and software rather than be powered by cloud services in data centres.

Apple’s top AI team is now made up of former key figures from Google, including Giannandrea, who previously oversaw Google Brain, the search company’s AI lab which has since been merged DeepMind.

Samy Bengio, senior director of AI and ML research, was formerly one of Google’s top AI scientists. Ruoming Pang, who leads Apple’s “Foundation Models” team working on large language models, previously led Google’s AI speech recognition research.

The company also once hired Ian Goodfellow, another deep learning pioneer, but he returned to Google in 2022, protesting Apple’s return to work policy.

2024-04-30 10:10:00,csklmf86,Big Tech (Google and Meta) begins to give out dividend,"Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia been giving out dividends for a long time despite being a huge tech firm. 

As of recently, Google and Meta decide to begin giving out dividends to its shareholders. Is this seen as bullish? 

We hold big tech firms due to huge earning growth potential and they tend to distribute their earnings into innovation and R&D, which will with no doubt boost their future earning if done right. 

Now that Google and Meta begin to give out dividend, it seems appealing for mutual fund managers to add more into their portfolios, which will boost their stock prices further. But this will probably hurt their future earning potential in long term as they will have less allocated to R&D. What do y'all think? 

This will also give pressure to Amazon to consider offering dividend to their shareholders. Tesla? I don't think so. "

>A landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets.

>A government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world.

>That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome.

>The government argues Google is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking competitors from entering three distinct markets: general online search, search advertising, and search text advertising.

>A government win would put at risk the billions of dollars in mutually lucrative contracts between Google and Apple, as well as deals with other device manufacturers and telecom companies.

> The government alleged in its case that Google pays billions of dollars each year to LG, Motorola (MSI), and Samsung; major US wireless carriers such as AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Verizon (VZ); and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.

>Government prosecutors have alleged that Google had been paying Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion per year — a portion of search ad revenue — in exchange for awarding Google Search default placement on Apple devices.

>The government has yet to say what precise remedy it desires should it prevail against Google. If the government does win on any of its claims, a separate remedies phase of the trial would be held."
2024-05-13 15:49:38,Abysswalker794,My thoughts about Google and their potential threat from AI search engines,"Hi all, I have seen a few comments on Reddit and YouTube regarding Google and their future. As you all know the competition in the search space is getting more competitive as companies trying to get a slice of that ad money. Meanwhile search bots have proven to be useful in many instances. 

As many bear cases have been written all over the internet, I will focus on the bull cases. I will share my top ten with you, and I promise you, this is fully written by myself without the help of AI. You will believe me as my English grammar is bad AF.

Let me give you first an overview about Google revenue streams by percentage:

57% Google Search ads, 10.3% YouTube Ads, 10.2% Google network ads, 11.3% Subscriptions and devices, 10.8% Google Cloud, Rest Are other bets. 

Of course Google search makes up a huge chunk of the revenue and even more of the profits. But I think what many people are missing in many of the discussions about Google is:

1. Google will not lose their 90% market share over night IF at all. It will be years until the majority of people will even notice that there are other options now. They know about ChatGPT and are still googling.

2. Regarding to Statcounter Google had 91.8% market share in January 2021. Now after ChatGPT and MS Copilot and whatever, Google stands at 90.9%. This is so little change, that we cannot even speak about a trend at the moment. 

3. IF Google is going to lose substantial market share it won’t go to zero. People are often pretending like Google is going to be irrelevant and losing all business. Not going to happen, Bing and DuckDuckGo existing during Googles dominance proves this. 

4. ⁠The minimum market share will always be the Android users. As Google will be defaulted with Android and Chrome devices. As long as the Apple Safari deal is legal and active the minimum base for Google is HUGE. I can’t see people changing the standard search engine pro actively, especially if it’s what they know - Google. That something like Bing even has market share at all, shows that people are likely to stay with the default. That is not an insult from my side this is an argument from Satya Nadella himself, made in court. At the moment, IF they change the default, they are more likely to switch from Bing to Google, than from Google to Bing. Additionally I think you can also add Google cloud business customer to this baseline.

5. That means advertiser will continue to pump money into Google search. Even if their market share goes down to 50-70%(very conservatively). They will very likely remain the number 1 search engine for a very long time. A few anecdotal tech bubble guys are not representative for changing the habits of billions of people. And with more people getting access to internet, the market as a whole will continue to grow.

6. ⁠Google does not only have the number 1 search engine, they also have number 2 with YouTube. YouTube is also getting a lot of advertising money and is still growing double digits.

7. Even if Google search money stops to grow or would decline, you have to look out for, if it would decline faster than the other segments will grow. If it’s flat or declining like 1-2% a year while Cloud and YouTube and Networks are growing double digits, Google will still generate Billions of cash flow a quarter. Similar to the current state of Apple with their IPhone sales.

8. Googles businesses are alle potential high margin businesses and are still growing double digits. Of course search is the number 1 but the other businesses would also be worth 100s of billions on their own.

9. I don’t see the threat of Google getting broken up by the authorities. You cannot made a bear case for both. Either they have monopoly that needs to be broken up, or they are threatened by AI companies. You cannot make a case for both at the same time imho. But even if they are getting punished or broken up, this will take YEARS in courts and after that they will be appeals by Google which will also take years. Until then there is a chance that Google businesses are more worth broken up in parts anyway. I see that very relaxed.

10. All of this doesn’t factor in any bets (like Waymo or their 8% SpaceX stake) that could take off or anything they are doing with Deepmind and AI which is a potential upside imho.

Google will be fine. Why I think YouTube, Networks, Cloud and other businesses are too businesses that will continue to grow would take another 100000 words and I think there are enough sources and analysis for that. So that’s it from my side, would love a positive vibes discussion.

Long story short: They could have some short term struggles due to sentiment and temporary revenue and profit lost. But they will be fine long term."
2024-05-14 10:59:46,Puginator,Google rolls out its most powerful AI models as competition from OpenAI heats up ,"Google is using its annual developer conference to showcase what the company is calling its lightest and most efficient artificial intelligence models.

At Google I/O on Tuesday, the company announced Gemini 1.5 Flash, the newest addition to the Gemini model series.

“We heard from developers that they wanted something faster and even more cost effective,” said Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, in a press briefing.

The unveiling comes as tech companies increasingly refocus their product development and rollouts around generative AI, which is of particular importance to Google because the new tools give consumers more advanced and creative ways to access online information compared to traditional web search.

OpenAI on Monday launched a new AI model and desktop version of ChatGPT, along with a new user interface. The new model, GPT-4o, is twice as fast as GPT-4 Turbo and half the cost, the company said.

Google also announced an improved Gemini 1.5 Pro model, which has the ability to make sense of multiple large documents — 1,500-pages total — or summarize 100 emails, according to a vice president working on Gemini.

Gemini 1.5 Pro will soon be able to handle an hour of video content, or codebases with more than 30,000 lines, Hsiao said.

“You can quickly get answers and insights about dense documents, like figuring out the details of the pet policy in your rental agreement or comparing key arguments of multiple long research papers,” Hsiao said.

OpenAI’s latest upgrade, announced this week, brings with it improved quality and speed of ChatGPT for 50 different languages. It will also be available via OpenAI’s application programming interface (API), allowing developers to begin building applications using the new model immediately, executives said.

With 35 languages, Google says Gemini 1.5 Pro has a 2 million token window, which measures context and indicates how much information the model is able to process at once. The new model has improved local reasoning, planning and image understanding, company executives said.

“It offers the longest context window of any foundational model yet,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in the press briefing. At the event, he gave an example of a parent asking Gemini to summarize all recent emails from their child’s school. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro will initially be available for testing in Workspace Labs. Gemini 1.5 Flash will be available for testing and in Vertex AI, which is Google’s machine learning platform that lets developers train and deploy AI applications.

Google then started doing buybacks on GOOG and not GOOGL which caused GOOG to overtake GOOGL in share price which makes sense.

2024-05-26 11:41:26,nams0,"Realistically, how high can NVDA actually go at this point?","Currently Nvidia has a market cap of 2.62T, making it the 3rd largest market cap company in US. This follows Microsoft at 3.19T and Apple at 2.91T. If Nvidia were to become #1 in market cap, which looks like that's going to happen soon, that would be about 22% increase in its stock price. But beyond that, how realistic is it for this company to keep growing up to 4T market cap and beyond? Are the prospects seriously that good? To hit 4T, Nvidia stock would need to rise by another 50%. I just can't see how that is going to happen. How can Nvidia, which really is just a company that makes GPUs and drives, end up being more valuable than Microsoft, Apple, and Google in the long term? Nvidia has a fantastic business model and ridiculous profit margins, but it still seems unrealistic to me for it's share price to keep growing and growing to a record high market cap at this point.

My gut feels like there is far too much hype surrounding Nvidia's prospects and price should drop a fair bit. I think it's too risky to buy in now and that after the stock split we will start seeing a correction. Thoughts?

edit: Lol what's with the downvotes? Are we not allowed to have open discussions?"
2024-06-05 12:11:27,Puginator,Nvidia briefly passes $3 trillion market cap on back of AI boom ,"Nvidia surpassed $3 trillion in market cap during intraday trading on Wednesday as investors continue to clamor for the company making most of the chips powering the AI boom.

Nvidia shares were up more than 4% to $1,219 at one point during intraday trading on Wednesday.

Nvidia’s milestone is the latest stunning mark in a run where the stock price has gone parabolic as investors bet on artificial intelligence. Shares are up over 3,224% over the last five years. It will split its stock 10-1 later this month.

Apple was the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion market cap in January 2022. Microsoft hit $3 trillion in market value in January 2024.

In May, Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings that suggested demand for the company’s pricey and powerful AI chips, often called GPUs, showed no sign of slowing down. Nvidia reported overall sales of $26 billion, more than triple what the company reported a year ago. Nvidia also beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings and said it would report revenue of about $28 billion in the current quarter.

Nvidia shares have surged in recent years, powered by the tech industry’s need for its chips, which are used to develop and deploy big artificial intelligence models like the one at the heart of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Companies such as Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are buying billions of dollars of Nvidia’s graphics processing units.

Here’s how the company did compared with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $1.63 adjusted vs. $1.65 expected

Revenue: $14.29 billion, vs. $14.55 billion expected

Oracle’s revenue increased 3% year over year during the quarter, which ended on May 31, according to a statement. Net income, at $3.14 billion, or $1.11 per share, was down from $3.32 billion, or $1.19 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

The cloud services and license support segment generated $10.23 billion in revenue, up 9% and slightly below the StreetAccount consensus of $10.29 billion.

The company’s cloud and on-premises licenses business contributed $1.84 billion in revenue. That’s down 15% and lower than the $2.09 billion StreetAccount consensus.

Cloud infrastructure revenue came to $2.0 billion, up 42%, which was a deceleration from the 49% growth rate in the prior quarter. The cloud business remains smaller than rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure but is growing faster.

Oracle said in a statement on Tuesday that it would bring its database to Google’s cloud, with availability coming in November. In an additional statement, Oracle said OpenAI has selected the Oracle public cloud to extend Microsoft’s AI infrastructure.

During the quarter, Oracle said its database software would be available in five additional Microsoft Azure data center regions, bringing the total to 15. Oracle also announced generative artificial intelligence features coming to its Fusion cloud applications for supply chain and human resources.

Notwithstanding the after-hours move, Oracle stock has gained 18% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up about 13% over the same period.

Google is in advanced talks to acquire cybersecurity firm Wiz for $23 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. The people familiar told the Journal that a deal could come soon. Wiz was founded in 2020, and has grown at a rapid clip under CEO Assaf Rappaport. It had been eyeing an IPO as recently as May, when the company achieved a valuation of $12 billion.

Wiz’s cloud security offering gives executives and cybersecurity professionals insight into the company’s full cloud presence, something appealing to large firms with significant computing resources. It is backed by a roster of blue chip firms, including Israeli VC firm Cyberstarts, Index Ventures, Insight Partners and Sequoia Capital.

If completed, the deal would be Google’s largest ever acquisition. It would also underline a clear and continued bet on cybersecurity, at a time when nation state and criminal actors have managed to disrupt governments and large organizations. Google has made large cyber acquisitions before: The company acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion two years ago. But the company now faces unprecedented levels of antitrust scrutiny. The Justice Department has sued Google twice on antitrust grounds. The company’s acquisition practices were highlighted in the most recent litigation, filed in 2023. But its reported talks with Wiz would suggest that the company has developed a fresh appetite for M&A, competitive concerns notwithstanding."
2024-07-22 19:34:47,Puginator,"Wiz walks away from $23 billion deal with Google, will pursue IPO ","Wiz has walked away from a $23 billion deal to be acquired by Google, in what would have been the search giant’s largest ever deal, telling employees it would pursue an initial public offering as it initially planned.

“Saying no to such humbling offers is tough,” Wiz co-founder Assaf Rappaport said in a memo obtained by CNBC to the company’s worldwide employee base.

The deal would have nearly doubled the $12 billion valuation of the startup from its most recent round of funding. Wiz was founded in 2020 and has grown at a rapid speed under Rappaport, who had been eyeing an IPO as recently as May. A person familiar with the company’s thinking cited both antitrust and investor concerns as part of the motivation behind the decision to walk away.

Wiz’s cloud security products include prevention, active detection and response — a range that has appealed to large firms and would have helped Google compete with Microsoft which also sells security software.

CNBC reported in July on the talks between Google and Wiz.

The company reportedly hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue after 18 months, and achieved $350 million in annual recurring revenue in 2023. It’s backed by a roster of blue-chip firms, including Israeli venture capitalist Cyberstarts, Index Ventures, Insight Partners and Sequoia Capital.

Google successfully acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion in 2022. Google’s largest deal remains the acquisition of hardware maker Motorola in 2012 for $12.5 billion, which it ended up selling to Lenovo for $2.9 billion in 2014. As recently as last week, Google reportedly ended conversations to acquire sales software maker HubSpot.

2024-07-28 08:03:33,Rauf_KB,$GOOGL Google is in a big trouble in the long run - here is why,"Let's do the math directly and take a look at Google ads results in 2023:

- The revenue generated by Google ads in 2023 is $237 billion.

- The revenue portion from Google search engine is around 60%!!! That means out of the $237 billion, around $142 billion revenue is generated from the search engine or search ads.

- Google's total revenue for 2023 was $305 billion, that means the revenue from the search engine only (not entire Google ads) makes around 45% of Google's total revenue.

Now the second search engine behind Google is Microsoft Bing, Microsoft generated in 2023 only $12 Billion from Bing ads.

Google by far is the dominant as for now, and Microsoft although in the second place behind them, won't be able to reach even a quarter of Google's revenue, they had many failed attempts to promote Bing.

Now some of you probably heared about the upcoming releases of SearchGPT, whoever tried ChatGPT will know it's by far better than Gemini and the other AI models, if Openai released their SearchGPT and people switched from Google search to SearchGPT (which I personally think will happen), Google in this case will keep 45% of its total revenue vulnerable by SearchGPT.

TL;DR Google have strong exposure to its search engine, the revenue generated from the search engine is around 45% of its total revenue, with the upcoming release of SearchGPT, Google may lose its dominance in the long term which may cause their revenue growth to stop or decline.

Revenue: $64.73 billion vs. $64.39 billion expected

Microsoft’s revenue increased 15% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $22.04 billion, was up from $20.08 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Judge Amit Mehta in Washington said that the Alphabet Inc. unit’s $26 billion in payments effectively blocked any other competitor from succeeding in the market.

Antitrust enforcers alleged that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over online search and related advertising. The government said that Google has paid Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and others billions over decades for prime placement on smartphones and web browsers. This default position has allowed Google to build up the most-used search engine in the world, and fueled more than $300 billion in annual revenue largely generated by search ads.

The case is the first antitrust trial pitting the federal government against a US technology company in more than two decades.

2024-08-13 13:41:53,Puginator,Google launches first AI-powered Android update and new Pixel 9 phones,"Google on Tuesday announced new artificial intelligence features that are coming to Android devices. The move to bring its Gemini AI assistant to supported devices shows again how Google aims to put its AI in front of consumers before Apple, which will launch its AI on iPhones, Macs and iPads later this year.

Google doesn’t make a lot of money from its hardware business but the latest Android features could help drive new revenue through the company’s Gemini AI subscription program.

“We’ve completely rebuilt the assistant experience with Gemini, so you can speak to it naturally the way you would with another person,” said Android Ecosystem President Sameer Samat in a Tuesday blog post. “It can understand your intent, follow your train of thought and complete complex tasks.”

“Starting today, you can bring up Gemini’s overlay on top of the app you’re using to ask questions about what’s on your screen,” Samat wrote. It will be available on hundreds of phone models from dozens of device makers, according to Google.

Google previously had some AI features in Android, but this is the first year it’s heavily emphasizing new capabilities powered by a large AI language model installed on devices.

One example the company provided involved a user uploading a photo of a concert list and asking Gemini to see if their calendar is free, after which Gemini checks Google Calendar. If the user has availability in their schedule, Gemini offers to create a reminder to check ticket prices later that night.

The assistant can also perform tasks using information from Google apps.

“For example, Gemini can help create a daily workout routine based on your personal trainer’s email, or use your resume in Google Drive to write a work bio,” the company stated in its blog post. 

The company also said a user might ask the Gemini assistant to draft an email and “create an image of a cake for someone who loves space,” which the assistant can create and attach to the email. Or, in YouTube, a user might ask Gemini a question about the content in a video.

You can ask about what’s on your phone screen in other apps, too, like Maps, Flights and Gmail. Google said it’s working to add support for third-party extensions, which suggests developers may be able to add the option to their apps later.

Gemini’s assistant has a range of voices. A user can have a human-like conversation through its Gemini “Live” feature, which the company first announced at its May developer conference. “Live” will initially be available for select devices and subscribers to Google’s Gemini Advanced program, which costs $19.99 per month.

In June, Apple announced its long-awaited artificial intelligence push, Apple Intelligence, that can do tasks like recognize notifications important to personal context, and do cross-application tasking as well as letting Siri tap into OpenAI’s ChatGPT when needed for tasks such as its writing tools and creating images.

Apple’s system is currently in testing. Some early features will launch this fall alongside new iPhones, but the bulk of the system won’t be released until next year.

New Pixel 9 phones and Pixel Watch 3

Google also announced its latest line of homegrown “Pixel” phones, including the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro, the Pixel 9 Pro XL and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which come with the Gemini AI features.

The Pixel 9 series has, among other new features, an upgraded camera and a screen that’s 35% brighter for better viewing in direct sunlight. It ships with Google’s latest Tensor G4 processor and 16GB of RAM to support AI use. RAM stands for random access memory —an important part of a computer’s hardware that stores data needed to run applications.

RAM is a crucial component for running artificial intelligence inside a smartphone. Google has said that the amount of memory is a major factor in determining whether a phone can run AI.

By contrast, only high-end iPhones released in 2023 can run Apple Intelligence, which AI developers believe is due to lower amounts of memory installed on older iPhones.

The Pixel 9 starts at $799, which costs $100 more than the Pixel 8, however, smartphone costs have risen across most phone makers in the last year. The Pixel 9 Pro, which comes with a free year of “Gemini Advanced” subscription, starts at $999 and the Pixel 9 Pro XL starts at $1,099. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold starts at $1,799.

Lastly, Google also announced the Pixel Watch 3. It’s available in two sizes, 41 millimeter and 45 mm, with larger screens than earlier models. New features include the option to plan running workouts, information on your recovery with readiness and cardio load data, and AI-powered workout recommendations. Google also said the Pixel Watch 3 is more deeply embedded with its ecosystem, allowing you to access Nest camera and doorbell feeds, the Google TV remote, offline Google Maps, and more.

2024-08-13 14:03:15,Fidler_2K,Bloomberg: US Considers a Rare Antitrust Move: Breaking Up Google,"A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.’s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.

The move would be Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.

Regardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google’s web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said.

The Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta’s Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government’s proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request.

Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses.

A Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment.

The US plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s.

Justice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google’s practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company’s search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google’s AI products in order to appear in search results.

**Breakup**

Divesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that’s been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store.

Those agreements also require that Google’s search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can’t be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found.

Mehta’s decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn’t yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn’t be allowed “to reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.”

Google paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc.

Mehta’s ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google’s total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year’s trial.

If the Justice Department doesn’t call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said.

**Data Access**

Another option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft’s Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta’s ruling found that Google’s contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data – 16 times as much as its next closest competitor — but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively.

Europe’s recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds.

Requiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department’s first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents.

In the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other.

**AI Products**

For years, websites have allowed Google’s web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company’s search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI.

Last fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn’t apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with “AI Overviews,” narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web.

Google doesn’t allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a “feature” of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews.

While AI Overviews only appear on a fraction of searches, the feature’s roll-out has been rocky after some excerpts offered embarrassing suggestions, like advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza.

2024-08-15 13:43:57,r2002,Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt sees Nvidia as big AI winner: ‘You know what to do in the stock market’,"I'm not looking for another debate about whether Nvidia deserves its valuation -- we've had tons of threads about that already. What I'm curious about is:

* What is your opinion of Eric Schmidt? Is he generally a trustworthy industry insider? Do you trust his opinions on this matter? (I looked for his name on this sub and it's rarely mentioned).

* If you don't trust him, what might be his motives for these comments? For example, is it perhaps to indirectly pump up his own Alphabet stock, which is probably #2 behind Nvidia and will benefit from big AI wave. (He owns 147 million shares)

Here's [link to the article](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/eric-schmidt-on-nvidia-you-know-what-to-do-in-the-stock-market.html) with some juicy bits:

* “I’m talking to the big companies, and the big companies are telling me they need $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion — very very hard,” said Schmidt, adding that he’s a “close friend” to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

* “If $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market,” Schmidt said. “That’s not a stock recommendation.” Schmidt didn’t say if he owns Nvidia shares.

* Schmidt, who was CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011 and remained on the board until 2019, was addressing a class of undergraduates on the topic of AI. He told the Wall Street Journal that he requested the video to be taken down because he had misspoken about Google’s lax work culture in the session.

* Schmidt suggested Nvidia won’t be the only winner in AI, but there aren’t a lot of other obvious choices. He said that he currently believes big companies who can invest more money into Nvidia chips and data centers will gain a technological lead over smaller competitors that can’t spend as freely.

* “At the moment, the gap between the frontier models — there are only three — and everyone else appears to be getting larger,” Schmidt said. “Six months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller, so I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I’m not so sure.”

* Schmidt said it will be difficult for competitors to catch up with Nvidia because many of the most important open source tools that AI developers use are based on the company’s CUDA programming language. He said AMD’s software that translates Nvidia’s CUDA code for its own chips “doesn’t work yet.”

* Schmidt, who started venture firm Innovation Endeavors in 2010, still holds about 147 million shares of Alphabet, according to Bloomberg, valued at about $24 billion. In addition to startup investing, he has been a philanthropist and advised several government committees on technology."

2024-08-25 03:21:25,Unusual-Double-2003,What Are Some Under-the-Radar Stocks with Strong Growth Potential Over the Next 5 Years?,"Looking for stock ideas that could grow big over the next five years. Not interested in the obvious picks like S&P500, Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc. I’m more curious about stocks that might be flying under the radar."
2024-08-31 01:54:12,DanielBeuthner,I think Alphabet (GOOGL) is the most undervalued stock in the stock market right now,"I am 100% invested in Alphabet due to several reasons. I think we are in a similar situation to Meta when it was faced with law suits, reached 90$ last year and everybody said it would die. 

1. Alphabet is growing in the double digits every year since its inception. Its PE is on the way to below 20 and laughably cheap for a tech company with that growth. 

3. They crushed earnings and the only reason for their slump afterwards was their heavy AI spending, which they can easily cut if they see its not worth it anymore. Also comparable to Meta.

2. Alphabet is a leader in innovative technologies such as autonomous driving. Tesla shot up 40% or something when Elon made another promise towards autonomous driving, while Google actually is the first mover and build up a network with hundred thousands of paying users. 

3. I dont think that AI will be as useful as some still expect. But in no way Google is endangered by that. I dont have more recent numbers, but in July Googles market share in the search business grew slightly, while ChatGPT declined by 12%. I think the summarised answers in Google search are already way more useful and convenient than what Bing or ChatGPT offers. 

4. If AI presents itself as useful Google and Meta will have the best model. People misunderstand how AI works. Its not the model which is important, its the underlying set of data. With the deal it closed with Reddit beginning of 2024, google honestly struck Gold for a really cheap price.

5. Tech companies are literally what keeps the american economy and influence in the world right now alive. I think its not realistic to think that the DOJ will do anything which substancially weakens an american tech company at this point. They will probably get a slap on the wrist in a way of a (big) fine. But priced in is currently a potential break up.

6. Atleast for the next earnings I expect an ad revenue ""short squeeze"" because of the really polarized american election. Way more money will be invested in ads than in previous elections, and while the sum on its own isnt that much, depending on how elastic the ad market is, it will drive up ad space for everyone involved."

Think about it, visa gets to collect money from every sale, not issue their cards, and they don't have to put any of their own credit on the line whenever they do it. Meanwhile, ACH is regulated to shit by the fed and a bunch of banks, but somehow Visa and Mastercard get to slip by and have profit margins of 50%. 

You'd think with the rise of the internet their influence would've been significantly reduced by competitors, but it appears to only get stronger by the year.  "

Shares of Amazon.com were up 2.6% at 2:09 p.m. on Monday, after rising 2.3% on Monday. With Monday’s move, Amazon passed Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the U.S. for the first time since April 5. Alphabet’s stock has fallen 8.7% in September, while Amazon is off just 0.7%. Amazon’s market cap was $22 billion more than Alphabet’s at Monday’s close, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Amazon had some good news for investors at an investor conference, noting that its cloud business, AWS, is gaining further traction in AI but that it’s also focused on “balancing expenditures with revenue growth,” according to BofA analyst Justin Post.

There was also good news from Oracle’s earnings. Yes, most of the good news was for Oracle stock, which has risen 12% on Thursday. But with the release of its earnings, Oracle and AWS said that they had come together with a new cloud product, Oracle Database@AWS. Oracle already has partnerships with Microsoft’s Azure and Google, but Post notes that the AWS/Oracle deal should be good for both companies. “Oracle & AMZN had been competitive for database customers, so new partnership suggests companies have a lot to gain by working together,” he writes.

Right now investors will just settle for gains.”

2024-09-12 13:02:23,aj_cohen,Google is down almost 20 percent from ATH and has entered bear market territory. my thesis,"Google as the title states has gone down 20 percent from the ATH which is more than other big tech companies have seen. and is now in bear market territory. 

First let's start with the balance sheet of Google which is pretty good for the most part.  Google revenue has increased at a rate of 18.16 percent a year which is extremely fast top-line growth.  Free cash flow growth has been good but more and more is going towards capx while google tries to improve their LLM.  The free cash flow is also further hurt by their stock-based comp which last year counted for nearly 32 percent of all free cash flow. EPS is going up at a rate of 21 percent in the last 5 years which is being accelerated by google buying back shares.  They have minimal debt and lots of cash. they  have recently issued a dividend which is great because it returns more profits back to shareholders.

***Why is google trading down so much***

Google has recently found itself to be a convicted monopoly by the DOJ and is also seeing regulation from the EU as well in other anti monopoly lawsuits.  This has increased the level of uncertainty in the stock because the punishments have yet to be given leaving investors in limbo of how detrimental this could actually be.

Google as well as other big tech companies have been spending ungodly amounts of money chasing AI and while I do think AI could prove to be a worthwhile investment in the future in the short term this is causing companies like Google to not be as capital efficient as they once were.

***What will cause google stock to go up***

The thesis is simple...  Once time passes and we get past these anti-trust lawsuits the future from Google will seem more clear and this will help with investor sentiment and certainty and help contribute to an increase in stock price.  Google is currently spending money on a upgrade cycle which is AI.  Once the boom for AI starts to go down, capex spending should move down, allowing Google to return to a more capital efficient business model.  Also keep in mind that Google owns so many entities (YouTube, Google Cloud, Google Search, -google office suite, and android).

TLDR: Google stock is probably undervalued and its probably gonna go up lmao

2024-09-18 07:50:30,Puginator,Google wins court challenge to the EU's $1.7 billion antitrust fine over ad product ,"The European Union’s second-highest court on Wednesday said a 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) fine imposed on Google by regulators should be annulled, siding with the U.S. tech giant after it challenged the ruling.

The case stems from 2019 when the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said Alphabet owned Google had abused its market dominance in relation to a product called AdSense for Search. This product allowed website owners to deliver ads into the search results on their own pages.

Google acts as an intermediary allowing advertisers to serve ads via search on third-party websites.

But the commission alleged that Google abused its market dominance by imposing a number of restrictive clauses in contracts with third-party websites, which ultimately prevented rivals from placing their search ads on these websites.

The commission fined Google 1.49 billion euros at the time. Google appealed, sending the case to the EU’s General Court.

The General Court said Wednesday that it “upholds the majority of the findings” but “annuls the decision by which the Commission imposed a fine of” nearly 1.5 billion euros.

The court added that the commission “failed to take into consideration all the relevant circumstances in its assessment of the duration of the contract clauses” that it had deemed abusive.

A Google spokesperson told CNBC that it would review the full decision closely.

“This case is about a very narrow subset of text-only search ads placed on a limited number of publishers’ websites. We made changes to our contracts in 2016 to remove the relevant provisions, even before the Commission’s decision. We are pleased that the court has recognized errors in the original decision and annulled the fine,” the spokesperson said.

A spokesperson for the commission said it takes note of the judgement and will reflect on the possible next steps.

The commission could appeal this decision which would send it up to European Court of Justice, the EU’s top court.

There has been a slew of court cases involving the EU and U.S. tech companies reaching their conclusions recently.

This month, the ECJ upheld a 2.4 billion euro fine imposed on Google for abusing its dominant position by favoring its own shopping comparison service. And the same court ruled that Apple must pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland, ending a decade-long case.

2024-09-18 13:32:22,Puginator,YouTube announces AI features from Google DeepMind for Shorts creators ,"YouTube on Wednesday announced artificial-intelligence features for creators on its Shorts platform that tap into Google’s DeepMind video-generation model.

The features, known as Veo, will allow creators to add AI-generated backgrounds to their videos as well as use written prompts to generate standalone, six-second video clips. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said he hopes Veo will enable creators to produce more Shorts videos with the help of AI.

“Everything that we showed with AI was meant to really enhance the work that you do, make it faster, more efficient, to bring your creative ideas to life faster,” said Mohan, speaking at the Made on YouTube event in New York.

The Veo AI backgrounds are an upgrade over a similar AI-generation feature announced by YouTube in 2023 called Dream Screen. The company said its Veo AI background feature will roll out later this year while the six-second AI clips will become available in 2025.

Other announcements at the event included new features in the YouTube Studio app that will allow creators to use AI to generate titles, thumbnails and video ideas. Those features will roll out in late 2024, YouTube said.

Creators have been exploring various ways to leverage generative AI technology. Creators have used the new technology to insert clips in their videos or produce entirely AI-generated videos.

However, some creators expressed concerns that their videos on YouTube are used to train the AI models that built Veo.

“I don’t know how I feel about all this AI stuff,” said Thomas Simons, a comedian with more than 15 million subscribers on YouTube. “It doesn’t fill me with confidence and love.”

There has been criticism that other services like Facebook have become overrun by spammy, AI-generated content. There are also concerns that AI-generated content could violate intellectual property protections.

YouTube’s AI-generated content will be watermarked and will have a label indicating it was created by AI, the company said.

Generative AI places a new perspective on the creator economy, giving creators free access to tools utilized by large language models.

We “really sit at the nexus of that technology and creativity,” Mohan said. “Putting those two things together gives us this unique lens that everything we build is really about enhancing that human creativity.”

2024-09-25 08:20:13,Puginator,Google files EU antitrust complaint accusing Microsoft of stifling cloud competition ,"Google filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission on Wednesday accusing Microsoft of using unfair licensing contracts to stifle competition in the multibillion-dollar cloud computing industry.

At the heart of Google’s complaint is the allegation that Microsoft uses unfair licensing terms to “lock in” clients and exert control over the cloud market.

Google alleges that Microsoft, through its dominant Windows Server and Microsoft Office products, can make it difficult for its massive roster of clients to use anything but its Azure cloud infrastructure offering.

The internet giant said in its complaint that restrictions contained in Microsoft’s cloud licensing terms makes it harder for customers to move their workloads from Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology to competitors’ clouds, despite there being no technical barriers to doing so.

European businesses and public sector organizations have been forced to pay the firm up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) a year in licensing penalties due to restrictions on customers’ ability to switch from one cloud provider to another, Google said, citing a 2023 study by CISPE, a trade body for the cloud computing sector.

The antitrust complaint from Google arrives after CISPE and its members in July agreed a settlement with Microsoft which would see the firm make changes to address competition concerns.

Referring to the CISPE settlement, Microsoft said in a statement Wednesday that it expects the European Commission to dismiss Google’s complaint.

“Microsoft settled amicably similar concerns raised by European cloud providers, even after Google hoped they would keep litigating,” a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC via email. “Having failed to persuade European companies, we expect Google similarly will fail to persuade the European Commission.”

Microsoft’s cloud ‘tax’ at issue

In a summary of the complaint, Google — which ranks third globally in the cloud computing market behind market leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, respectively — said that Microsoft “harms cybersecurity and undermines innovation.”

According to Google, if a company runs Microsoft’s Office suite of productivity tools and other applications on Google Cloud Platform or other competing clouds, they are effectively required to pay a “tax” in the form of punchy licensing fees to Microsoft.

Google said that Microsoft undermined competition in cloud, and referred to findings of a U.K. Competition and Markets Authority study which determined Microsoft acquired over 60% to 70% of all new British businesses in 2021 and 2022.

Google also suggested that Microsoft’s cloud practices have potentially made businesses more prone to security issues.

In an interview with CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal Wednesday, Amit Zavery, Google Cloud’s head of platform, said Google believes Microsoft is “100%” in violation of EU antitrust rules.

“We would like the cloud market to remain and become very vibrant and open for all the providers including European vendors, vendors like us, AWS and others,” Zavery said.

“Today the restrictions does not allow choice for customers,” Zavery said. “Today the restrictions does not allow choice for customers,” he said, adding that Microsoft included restrictions once it realized the massive commercial potential of the technology.

“So, we would want those restrictions to be removed and allow customers to have and choose whatever cloud provider they think is best for them commercially and technically,” he added.

Zavery told CNBC that if Microsoft makes changes to its cloud licensing terms as a result of its complaint, Google and cloud customers more broadly would be “very happy.”

Following the July settlement agreement with Microsoft, CISPE said the tech giant would work with its members to release an enhanced version of Azure Stack HCI, a cloud infrastructure product, to offer the same features that Microsoft customers using its Azure product currently benefit from.

Google, which is not a CISPE member, said it disagreed with the settlement and chose not to participate in the agreement. Amazon Web Services, which is a CISPE member, and Alibaba’s cloud unit AliCloud, also chose not to become part of the settlement.

For its part, Microsoft has denied that its cloud practices harm competition. In response to a cloud market study initiated by the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority, the firm said that it “firmly believes that the cloud services market is functioning well.”

2024-09-28 15:18:23,LarryKingsGhost,"AI Plays: NVD, AMD, GOOGL + a Couple Broader Questions","What’s up people,

Hope everyone is good. Posting this in hopes of getting some discussion about AI and possible investments going.

For context, with all the talk about AI going on, I've been trying to learn what I can about it. I don’t have any relevant background or expertise, but I’ve increasingly felt compelled to learn about it so I'm at least not totally ignorant. At this point, I’ve mostly been watching YouTube interviews of Altman/Zuckerberg/Gates types, along with lectures that Stanford makes available.

In the midst of this, I watched two videos in which separate AI researchers mentioned a [2019 blog post titled “The Bitter Lesson.”](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) Apparently, this blog post was written by a computer scientist and is really influential in the field. One of the main takeaways, as I understand it, is that all that really matters for improving AI is providing more computing power.

Given how much the tech community seems to believe this, I decided to make a few plays in the space, buying literally just a few shares of NVDA, AMD, and GOOGL earlier this week. NVDA and GOOGL are obviously some of the biggest names in the space, albeit in different aspects. I took a chance on AMD, even though people seem to say their tech isn't as good, just because I still feel like it could rise with the rest of the field as long as people keep thinking AI is the future.

To be candid, I’m cynical about about how AI will be used and, more broadly, I don’t really think this is a great time to just now be getting into the market- from my perspective, it still seems like a lot of people are burnt out from work/life, and the companies that are making more money seem to be doing so largely by raising prices. I’m not sure how sustainable it all is without some sort of correction. Still, I wanted to get a little skin in the game so that I’m motivated to keep learning.

If anyone finds any of this worth talking about, I have two ongoing questions at this point:

1)    What really excites people in the field about generative AI/large language models from a technological/computer science perspective? For example, when blockchain was blowing up, I heard it said that Blockchain was exciting because it made it possible to transfer a digital file such that the original sender no longer possessed the file after sending. Regardless of my personal opinions on the technology, that explanation at least made sense to me, and I could imagine possible applications and why people might be excited. What is it about AI that likewise has tech experts so excited really? What specifically does it allow them to do that they could never do before, and why is that valuable?

2)    Outside of the people running tech companies, who is really positioned to benefit from AI? In nearly every video I see of Sam Altman talking, he says something like, “I believe AI will have a positive net benefit on society overall.” I wonder, though, how he would measure this. It seems to me like AI will help any company or user that can leverage it to make money, but could end up harming a lot of employees and end consumers. I feel like it could just accelerate trends of companies extracting more and more money from the rest of the population. I'm really not trying to make this political or turn it into a debate on capitalism. That’s just my honest gut feeling about it from an economic perspective at this point. I see it providing a lot of benefit to a relatively small segment of the population.

Would be interested to hear what other people think and if/how you are investing in the space. I'd even like to know if people here actually use AI in their personal lives. And if anyone has resources that they feel have helped deepen their knowledge about AI, I’d really appreciate you sharing. I feel like I’ve kind of hit a wall trying to get beyond surface-level discussions about the field.

Cheers."

***Update***: below is the summary of WSJ report , and it’s not my opinions.

Short Summary:

  
Google’s share of the U.S. search ad market is expected to drop below 50% next year for the first time in over a decade

Biggest competitors:  Challenge faced from Amazon (shoppers bypass google and directly search the items on E-commerce website), Bing (market share has grown steadily since Feb 2023 according to [Search Engine Market Share Worldwide | Statcounter Global Stats](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share#monthly-202302-202409)), Perplexity AI (Nvidia software engineers switched away from google when comes search related to work. ), GPTSearch (yet to be release), Tiktok (younger generations)

Perplexity AI: startup will allow brands to sponsor follow-up questions that trigger a back-and-forth with the use. “What we’re opening up is the ability for a brand to spark or inspire somebody to ask a question about them,” Shevelenko said.

  
Bing:  [Microsoft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT) has introduced [sponsored links](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en/blog/post/september-2023/transforming-search-and-advertising-with-generative-ai) and comparison-shopping ads in a chatbot attached to its Bing search engine. Almost 60% of U.S. consumers used a chatbot to help research or decide on a purchase in the past 30 days, 



TikTok said “search behaviors have evolved” and added that the platform had global daily search volume of over three billion, with 23% of users searching for something within 30 seconds of opening the app.

2024-10-07 12:06:03,JRshoe1997,US judge orders Google to open up app store to competition,"A U.S. judge on Monday ordered Alphabet's Google to overhaul its mobile app business to give Android users more options to download apps and to pay for transactions within them, following a jury verdict last year for “Fortnite” maker Epic Games.

The injunction by U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco outlined the changes Google must undertake to open up its lucrative app store, Play, to greater competition, including making Android apps available from rival sources.

Donato's order said that for three years Google cannot prohibit the use of in-app payment methods and must allow users to download competing third-party Android app platforms or stores.

The order restricts Google from making payments to device makers to preinstall its app store and from sharing revenue generated from the Play store with other app distributors.

Google and Epic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Alphabet shares were down nearly 2% following the ruling. Donato said Epic and Google must establish a three-person technical committee to implement and monitor the injunction. Epic and Google each get a pick, and those two members will select the third person.

Epic’s lawsuit, filed in 2020, accused Google of monopolizing how consumers access apps on Android devices and how they pay for in-app transactions.

The Cary, North Carolina-based company persuaded a jury in December 2023 that Google unlawfully stifled competition through its controls over app distribution and payments, paving the way for Donato's injunction.

Google had urged Donato to reject Epic’s proposed reforms, arguing they were costly, overly restrictive and could harm consumer privacy and security. The judge mostly dismissed those arguments during an August hearing.

“You’re going to end up paying something to make the world right after having been found to be a monopolist,” he told Google's lawyers.

In a separate antitrust case in Washington, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta on Aug. 5 ruled for the U.S. Justice Department and said Google had illegally monopolized Web search, spending billions to become the internet’s default search engine.

Google also began a trial in September in Virginia federal court in a Justice Department lawsuit over its dominance in the market for advertising technology.

Google has denied the claims in all three cases.

2024-10-08 19:32:58,Fidler_2K,Bloomberg: US Says It’s Weighing Google Breakup as Monopoly Case Remedy,"The US Justice Department told a federal judge it is considering recommending that Google be forced to sell off parts of its operations to alleviate the harm caused by its monopolization of the online search market, in what would be a historic antitrust breakup.

In a court filing Tuesday, antitrust enforcers said Judge Amit Mehta could also force the Alphabet Inc. unit to provide access to the underlying data it uses to build its search results and artificial intelligence products.

The Justice Department “is considering behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features — including emerging search access points and features, such as artificial intelligence — over rivals or new entrants,” the agency said in the filing.

The filing represents Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. The 32-page filing lays outs a framework of potential options for the judge to consider as the case moves to the remedy phase.

Antitrust enforcers said Google gained scale and data benefits from its illegal distribution agreements with other tech companies that made make its search engine the default option on smartphones and web browsers.

Mehta, who ruled this summer that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets, plans to hold a trial on the proposed remedy next spring and issue a decision by August 2025. Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta’s decision, but must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so.

Google’s Android business encompasses the operating system used on smartphones and devices as well as apps.

On Monday, a different federal judge ordered Google to open up its app store for the next three years to resolve a separate antitrust case related to its dominance of app distribution on Android smartphones. The company also plans to appeal that decision.

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress","Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June."

The stock climbed 2.4% to close at $138.07, topping its prior high of $135.58 on June 18. The shares are now up almost 180% for the year and have soared more than nine-fold since the beginning of 2023.

Nvidia, widely viewed as the company selling the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, has been the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI boom, which started with the public release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to create and deploy advanced AI models that power ChatGPT and similar applications.

Companies including Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia GPUs in large quantities to build increasingly large clusters of computers for their advanced AI work. Those companies are all slated to report quarterly results by the end of October.

Of the billions of dollars the top tech companies are spending annually on their AI buildouts, an outsized amount is going to Nvidia, which controls about 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, according to analysts at Mizuho.

Nvidia’s revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and at least tripled in three of those periods. Growth is expected to modestly slow the rest of the year, with analysts projecting expansion of about 82% to $32.9 billion in the quarter ending in October, according to LSEG.

Nvidia recently said that demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is “insane” and it expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter.

With a market cap of $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is the second most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, behind Apple at about $3.55 trillion.

2024-10-15 06:26:45,_hiddenscout,Google to buy nuclear power for AI datacentres in ‘world first’ deal,"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/15/google-buy-nuclear-power-ai-datacentres-kairos-power

Google has signed a “world first” deal to buy energy from a fleet of mini nuclear reactors to generate the power needed for the rise in use of artificial intelligence.

The US tech corporation has ordered six or seven small nuclear reactors (SMRs) from California’s Kairos Power, with the first due to be completed by 2030 and the remainder by 2035.

Google hopes the deal will provide a low-carbon solution to power datacentres, which require huge volumes of electricity.

The US company, owned by Alphabet, said nuclear provided “a clean, round-the-clock power source that can help us reliably meet electricity demands”.

The explosive growth of generative AI, as well as cloud storage, has increased tech companies’ electricity demands.

Last month, Microsoft struck a deal to take energy from Three Mile Island, activating the plant for the first time in five years. The site, in Pennsylvania, was the location of the most serious nuclear meltdown in US history, in March 1979. Amazon bought a datacentre powered by nuclear energy in March from Talen Energy.

The locations of the new plants and financial details of the agreement were not revealed. Google has agreed to buy a total of 500 megawatts of power from Kairos, which was founded in 2016 and is building a demonstration reactor in Tennessee, due to be completed in 2027.

Michael Terrell, the senior director for energy and climate at Google, said: “The grid needs new electricity sources to support AI technologies that are powering major scientific advances, improving services for businesses and customers, and driving national competitiveness and economic growth.

“This agreement helps accelerate a new technology to meet energy needs cleanly and reliably, and unlock the full potential of AI for everyone.”

2024-10-16 06:29:23,_hiddenscout,"Amazon goes nuclear, to invest more than $500 million to develop small modular reactors","https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/10/16/amazon-goes-nuclear-investing-more-than-500-million-to-develop-small-module-reactors.html

Amazon Web Services is investing over $500 million in nuclear power, announcing three projects from Virginia to Washington State. AWS, Amazon's subsidiary in cloud computing, has a massive and increasing need for clean energy as it expands its services into generative AI. It's also a part of Amazon's path to net-zero carbon emissions.

AWS announced it has signed an agreement with Dominion Energy, Virginia's utility company, to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor, or SMR, near Dominion's existing North Anna nuclear power station. Nuclear reactors produce no carbon emissions.

An SMR is an advanced type of nuclear reactor with a smaller footprint that allows it to be built closer to the grid. They also have faster build times than traditional reactors, allowing them to come online sooner.

Amazon is the latest large tech company to buy into nuclear power to fuel the growing demands from data centers. Earlier this week, Google announced it will purchase power from SMR developer Kairos Power. Constellation Energy is restarting Three Mile Island to power Microsoft data centers.

""We see the need for gigawatts of power in the coming years, and there's not going to be enough wind and solar projects to be able to meet the needs, and so nuclear is a great opportunity,"" said Matthew Garman, CEO of AWS. ""Also, the technology is really advancing to a place with SMRs where there's going to be a new technology that's going to be safe and that's going to be easy to manufacture in a much smaller form.""

Virginia is home to nearly half of all the data centers in the U.S., with one area in Northern Virginia dubbed Data Center Alley, the bulk of which is in Loudon County. An estimated 70% of the world's internet traffic travels through Data Center Alley each day.

Dominion serves roughly 3,500 megawatts from 452 data centers across its service territory in Virginia. About 70% is in Data Center Alley. A single data center typically demands about 30 megawatts or greater, according to Dominion Energy. Bob Blue, its president and CEO, said in a recent quarterly earnings call that the utility now receives individual requests for 60 megawatts to 90 megawatts or greater. Dominion projects that power demand will increase by 85% over the next 15 years. AWS expects the new SMRs to bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the Virginia region.

""Small modular nuclear reactors will play a critical role in positioning Virginia as a leading nuclear innovation hub,"" said Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a release. ""Amazon Web Services' commitment to this technology and their partnership with Dominion is a significant step forward to meet the future power needs of a growing Virginia.""

AWS plans to invest $35 billion by 2040 to establish multiple data center campuses across Virginia, according to an announcement from Youngkin last year.

""These SMRs will be powering directly into the grid, so they'll go to power everything, part of that is the data centers, but everything that is plugged into the grid will benefit,"" Garman added.

Amazon also announced a new agreement with utility company Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, to fund the development, licensing and construction of four SMRs in Washington State. The reactors will be built, owned and operated by Energy Northwest but will provide energy directly to the grid, which will also help power Amazon operations.

Under the agreement, Amazon will have the right to purchase electricity from the first four modules. Energy Northwest has the option to build up to eight additional modules. That power would also be available to Amazon and Northwest utilities to power homes and businesses.

The SMRs will be developed with technology from Maryland-based X-energy, a developer of SMRs and fuel. Along with Amazon's other announcements, Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund disclosed it is the lead anchor in a $500 million financing round for X-Energy. The Climate Pledge Fund is its corporate venture capital fund that invests in early-stage sustainability companies. Other investors include Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin, affiliates of Ares Management Corporation, NGP and the University of Michigan.

""Amazon and X-energy are poised to define the future of advanced nuclear energy in the commercial marketplace,"" said X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell. ""To fully realize the opportunities available through artificial intelligence, we must bring clean, safe, and reliable electrons onto the grid with proven technologies that can scale and grow with demand.""

Last spring, AWS invested in a nuclear energy project with Talen Energy, signing an agreement to purchase nuclear power from the company's existing Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, a nuclear power station in Salem Township, Pennsylvania. AWS also purchased the adjacent, nuclear-powered data center campus from Talen for $650 million.

2024-10-17 12:01:25,Puginator,"Google CEO names new search and ads boss, slides predecessor to chief technologist","Google is replacing Prabhakar Raghavan, the company’s search and ads boss, with longtime Google executive Nick Fox.

The move was announced by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, who said in a blog post on Thursday that Raghavan will be moving into the role of chief technologist after 12 years of leading teams across the search company. Raghavan will continue to report to Pichai in the new role, the company told CNBC in a statement.

“Prabhakar has decided it’s time to make a big leap in his own career,” Pichai wrote in the post. “In this role, he’ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.”

The move comes as Google continues to restructure its teams to move more quickly in the artificial intelligence arms race, where it faces increased competition. The company is also dealing with several antitrust lawsuits related to its search and ads business.

Fox has long been a member of Raghavan’s leadership team. He will be leading Google’s Knowledge and Information division, which includes the company’s search, ads and commerce products, Pichai said.

A Google employee since 2003, Fox has been vice president for product and design for the company’s Assistant product in recent years. He previously worked within the company’s ads business unit.

“Over the past few years, Nick has been instrumental in shaping Google’s AI product roadmap and collaborating closely with Prabhakar,” Pichai wrote.

Raghavan led the knowledge and information unit since 2018. Earlier this year, he told employees to prepare for a different market reality because “things are not like they were 15-20 years ago,” CNBC reported.

Additionally, Pichai announced that the team working on Google’s Gemini app, which includes Google’s AI direct-to-consumer products, will join Google DeepMind under AI head Demis Hassabis.

“Bringing the teams closer together will improve feedback loops, enable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app,” Pichai wrote.

The move also means the Assistant teams focused on devices and home experiences will move to the Platforms and Devices unit “so they can sit closer to the product surfaces they’re building for,” Pichai wrote.

2024-10-29 11:12:21,Puginator,"Microsoft's GitHub goes beyond OpenAI, welcomes AI models from Anthropic, Google","Microsoft has a very expensive and very public relationship with artificial intelligence startup OpenAI. But one of Microsoft’s most successful AI products, GitHub Copilot, is now going beyond OpenAI to give developers more choice in what models they want to use.

GitHub, which Microsoft acquired in 2018, said in a blog post on Tuesday that developers will be able to power the GitHub Copilot Chat feature with Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model or Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, as alternatives to OpenAI’s GPT-4o, if they choose.

“There is no one model to rule every scenario, and developers expect the agency to build with the models that work best for them,” GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said in the post. “It is clear the next phase of AI code generation will not only be defined by multi-model functionality, but by multi-model choice. Today, we deliver just that.”

Microsoft introduced GitHub Copilot in 2021, offering source code suggestions to software developers. Copilot relies on models from OpenAI, which has received billions of dollars in funding from Microsoft and has exploded in popularity since releasing ChatGPT in late 2022.

OpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini, which are meant to reason over difficult problems, will also be available in the Copilot Chat on GitHub’s website and in the open-source Visual Studio Code text editor. They’re currently available in a public preview. Google’s model will be released in public preview in the next few weeks, a spokesperson said.

The arrival of the o1 models from OpenAI in September led GitHub to look at adding a dropdown menu for Copilot to provide more options, Dohmke said in an interview with CNBC last week. At that point, it felt like “the right time” to add models from Anthropic and Google, Dohmke said.

Developers will be able to see which model works best for a given programming language or employ the one that adheres to corporate requirements, he added.

Many other Microsoft products, including Teams and Windows, use OpenAI models. And Microsoft continues to provide computing power to OpenAI, which is now valued at $157 billion. But the relationship between the two companies has frayed in the past year, following the sudden ouster and reinstatement of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in November. The dramatic incident reportedly angered Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

In February, Microsoft announced a partnership with early-stage AI model developer Mistral. The following month, Microsoft said it was hiring former DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman and employees of his startup, Inflection, whose Pi assistant competed with OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT. Over the summer, Microsoft named OpenAI as a competitor in a regulatory filing.

In the past month, GitHub has collaborated with engineering teams from Anthropic and Google on the safety, security and scalability of their models, Dohmke said.

“We are planning on extending that list in the future but have no partnerships to announce at this point,” he said, adding that GitHub wouldn’t want to overwhelm developers with too many choices.

Also on Tuesday, GitHub announced that its Copilot will gain the ability to perform speedy automated reviews of code updates through a public preview.

And GitHub showed a technical preview of a feature named Spark that can compose app prototypes based on text input and refine the designs with a few clicks. Developers will be able to modify the underlying code for the prototypes. Those interested in trying Spark can join a waiting list.

Once they receive access, people using Spark will be able to choose between GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, a GitHub spokesperson said.

2024-10-29 13:16:39,Puginator,Reddit shares soar 16% on earnings beat and better-than-expected forecast,"Reddit shares jumped 16% in extended trading on Tuesday after the social media company reported third-quarter results that topped analyst estimates and issued an optimistic forecast for the current period.

Here’s how the company did compared to LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** 16 cents vs. a loss of 7 cents
* **Revenue:** $348.4 million vs. $312.8 million expected

Reddit said fourth-quarter revenue will be between $385 million to $400 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $357.9 million. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter will be in the range of $110 million to $125 million, higher than the $85.2 million average estimate.

Revenue in the third quarter jumped 68% from a year earlier, and the company turned profitable, reporting net income of $29.9 million, compared to a net loss of $7.4 million during the same quarter a year ago.

The company said that its daily active users grew 47% year-over-year in the third quarter to 97.2 million, better than analyst estimates of 96.5 million.

Average revenue per user was $3.58 for the third quarter, which beat analyst estimates of $3.24.

“It was another strong quarter for Reddit and our communities as we achieved important milestones, including new levels of user traffic, revenue growth, and profitability,” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a statement. “Reddit continues to be one of the most visited and trusted sites in the world with opportunities available to us that aren’t available to most companies.”

This is Reddit’s third earnings report since going public in March. The stock has more than doubled in value since its IPO, closing on Tuesday at $81.74, giving the company a market cap of $13.6 billion.

Since last year, Reddit has benefited from Google search updates that helped push its content higher in results, bringing in a flood of new users to the 19-year-old social media service. However, the newer users, which Reddit refers to as logged-out users, generate less online advertising revenue for the company than logged-in users, who typically spend more time on the platform, Reddit has detailed in financial filings.

The company said that global logged-out users grew 70% from a year earlier to 53.1 million, while global logged-in users increased 27% to 44.1 million.

Huffman told CNBC in August that the company has been making it easier for new users to create accounts and is developing more recommendation features to turn newbies into long-term users. He also said that Reddit’s direct traffic is “really resilient” to any Google search changes.

I got a lot of apples and oranges responses.
I understand they are in different industries but a dollar is a dollar and I rather spend it on a stock with better value. Google is a way better company in every metric (even before today's earnings). 

I also got a lot of responses like ChatGpt will destroy search and Lina Khan will smash it into a million pieces.

Anyone still rather buy Nike over Google? 🍿"

Apparently that's a $20decillion, fine.

  
Google banned the ultra-nationalist Tsargrad channel from YouTube in 2020, in response to US sanctions imposed against its owner, but after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 more channels were added to the banned list. 

The court imposed a 100,000 rubles per day, equivalent to about $1,025, with the total fine doubling every week. Thanks to the compound interest Google has now racked up a fine which the Russian judge on Monday called ‘a case in which there are many, many zeroes’. There are so many zeroes, in fact that the total fine amount completely dwarfs global GDP, which the World Bank estimates at about $100trillion.

In its most recent earnings statement, it said: ‘We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. ‘For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.

I like to keep track of my stocks on Google Sheets, however, my SP500 Index Fund seems to not be available on Google Finances (SXR8.DE). Is AMS:CSPX the most similar one and is SXR8.DE not available at all?"
2024-11-07 11:40:22,PancakeBreakfest,Why would breaking up google increase shareholder value?,"I’m seeing people comment that breaking up alphabet would increase shareholder value, and don’t understand why that’s the case. Doesn’t the business benefit from its massive scale, and synergies between its departments? Wouldn’t those go away to some extent if it’s split up? How can something that seems bad for the business lead to an increase in shareholder value?"
2024-11-07 15:11:53,Overlord1317,Two questions about GOOG *vis a vis* GOOGL,"First, is there a legal/technical/business reason why the shares are split this way (voting and non-voting) in the first place?  This feels ridiculous, but I am often profoundly ignorant when it comes to stocks, so someone will probably point out why it's a good idea/required/a sacrifice to the gods/etc.

Secondly, I am at a loss as to why there is *ever* a significant gap between the two ... let alone one in favor of the non-voting shares.  The only two reasons I can think of is laziness and/or confusion.  It's like having two gas stations right next to each other sharing the same driveway, they should either be exactly the same price-per-gallon or so close that by the time you finish driving up to the cheaper option, the more expensive one has already moved its price downwards."
2024-11-12 09:13:47,Puginator,"Waymo opens robotaxi service to anyone in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet","Alphabet-owned Waymo is removing the waitlist for its self-driving service in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet.

Starting Tuesday, anyone in LA will be able to use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County, the company said. That includes the 300,000 Angelenos who have been on Waymo’s waitlist.

With more than 3.8 million people, LA marks the third and largest city where the company’s robotaxi service is now fully available. It follows San Francisco, where Waymo One opened citywide in June. The company opened the service in Phoenix in 2020.

“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a news release Tuesday. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”

The company has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week across its three markets via the Waymo One app, the company said Tuesday. That’s up from 100,000 in August.

Waymo in September announced that it partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in 2025. The next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a Geely Zeekr that’s equipped with custom sensors and an AI “driver.” Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai that will add the South Korean automaker’s Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.

The Waymo One service has been embraced by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. It has also been used by parents to send their teens to school.
