2023-11-16 03:38:24,DerpJungler,"""Magnificent 7"" vs S&P 500?","I really don't like the *""Magnificent 7""* name at all, but since everyone has adopted it, let's just roll with it. For those who don't know the Magnificent 7 are: **AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, NVDA.** With a combined market cap of **more than $11 trillion**, they currently make up approx. **29% of the S&P 500's market cap.** 

The 7 giants have gained **71%** so far this year while the rest of the 493 stocks included in the benchmark index have gained 6%. They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets. 

Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least. 

Now I know this is a ""stocks"" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&P 500 ETF.

So I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META & TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.

Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future. Nowdays it's as difficult as ever to overtake these giants, imo."

It’s fun to look for the next big thing like space, crypto, renewable energy, crispr, etc but sometimes the best companies are more obvious 


I’ve been using Apple, Amazon, costco for 8+ years and I’m loving it, if only I had been invested for just as long. I’m trying to think of examples where it would’ve failed too, perhaps SNAP or nintendo would be companies whose products I used a lot haven’t done great. 


Recently I’ve been picking up Sony because I love my ps5 and Robinhood bc of the UI, ease of use, and solid apy and IRA match. Anyone else really like a product so you buy the stock?"

This is when you can expect real growth to start. 2025 earnings growth is forecast to be up another 50%. With PE falling from 25 to 20 this would mean stock price growth of about 40%. Thereafter expect the stock to grow like for like with earnings. If you think AI is more than just hype, if you think it will bring change akin to the internet or smartphones, we're looking at a long term compounding machine that will easily beat the market. "

Everyone who knows something knows to keep an eye on Nvidia but it just keeps getting better and better.

2024-01-15 11:59:36,kd__100,My summary on Nvidia's (NVDA) outperformance last week,"**NVDA (WTD +10.5%):** Shares in Nvidia saw gains upwards of 10% after a slew of mixed news, ultimately lifted by one final positive catalyst. At the start of the week, (1) reports suggested that the chip-maker were looking to introduce new AI chips to comply with US restrictions, in China. (2) Though the WSJ reported that there was slower demand for its newly-introduced chips from Chinese buyers. (3) Later, Nvidia announced a new set of graphics chips for AI PC’s. My opinion? Gains in Wall Street were led by Nvidia, no doubt. But the positive news, coupled with a relatively lower yield environment most definitely gave a helping hand for the chip-maker."

2024-01-25 14:17:40,_hiddenscout,Intel stock sinks as early 2024 outlook comes up short,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html)

Intel shares dropped in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker issued an outlook for the first quarter of 2024 that lagged analyst forecasts even as results for the latest quarter beat Wall Street estimates.  
  
Here’s how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December:  
  
Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected  
Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected

  
For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue.  
  
Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year.  
  
With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue.  
  
Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street.  
  
Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia’s recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs.  
  
Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips.  
  
Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022.  
  
Intel’s largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%.  
  
Intel’s second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs.  
  
Intel foundry services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase."
2024-01-30 14:15:31,Puginator,Q2 Earnings - Microsoft beats estimates as Azure grows faster than expected,"Here’s how the company performed, compared with consensus among analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings: $2.93 per share, vs. $2.78 per share expected

Revenue: $62.02 billion, vs. $61.12 billion expected

Microsoft’s revenue increased 17.6% year over year in the year, which ended on Dec. 31, according to a statement. Net income, at $21.87 billion, or $2.93 per share, increased from $16.43 billion, or $2.20 per share.

The company’s Intelligent Cloud segment produced $25.88 billion in revenue, up 20% and above the $25.29 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The grouping contains Azure cloud infrastructure, SQL Server, Windows Server, Nuance, GitHub and enterprise services.

Within that segment, revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30%. Analysts polled by CNBC had expected 27.7% growth, and the StreetAccount consensus was 27.5%. The metric for the previous quarter was 29%.

Revenue from the Productivity and Business Processes unit including Office productivity software, LinkedIn and Dynamics totaled $19.25 billion. That was up 13% and higher than the $18.99 billion StreetAccount consensus.

The More Personal Computing segment contributed $16.89 billion in revenue, up about 19% and more than the StreetAccount consensus of $16.79 billion. The segment comprises Windows, Surface, Bing and Xbox.

During the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft closed its acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, its largest deal ever. The company also announced custom cloud chips and started selling a $30 monthly Copilot artificial intelligence add-on to Microsoft 365 productivity software bundles.

But layoffs continued. Microsoft’s LinkedIn subsidiary cut around 700 jobs in October on top of the 10,000 announced earlier in the year. Last week, Microsoft said it’s eliminating around 1,900 employees in its gaming unit, or about 9% of headcount, following the Activision deal.

2024-01-31 17:45:47,mickdewgul,Two Big Differences Between AMD & NVDA,"I was digging deep into a lot of tech stocks on my watch lists and came across what I think are two big differences that separate AMD and NVDA from a margins perspective and a management approach.

Obviously, at the moment NVDA has superior technology and the current story for AMD's expected rise (an inevitable rise in the eyes of most) is that they'll steal future market share from NVDA. That they'll close the gap and capture billions of dollars worth of market share. Well, that might eventually happen, but I couldn't ignore these two differences during my research. 

The first is margins. NVDA is rocking an astounding 42% profit margin and 57% operating margin. AMD on the other hand is looking at an abysmal .9% profit margin and 4% operating margins. Furthermore, when it comes to management, NVDA is sitting at 27% of a return on assets and 69% return on equity while AMD posts .08% return on assets and .08% return in equity. Thats an insane gap in my eyes. 

Speaking to management there was another insane difference. AMD's president rakes home 6 million a year while the next highest paid person is making just 2 million. NVDA's CEO is making 1.6 million and the second highest paid employee makes 990k. That to me looks like greedy president on the AMD side versus a company that values it's second tier employees in NVDA. 

I've been riding the NVDA wave for nearly a decade now and have been looking at opening a defensive position in AMD, but those margins and the CEO salary disparity I found to be alarming at the moment. Maybe if they can increase their margins it'll be a buy for me, but waiting for a pull back until then and possibly a more company friendly President."
2024-02-04 07:41:59,wyo45,Ships that have sailed and those still set to sail,"We all know the stocks and assets that have gone to the moon since the last decade or so. Big tech, Tesla, Bitcoin, NVDA, AMD, and many others. I remember trading msft around 50.00 share in 2015ish thinking this is a boring old PC company lol. 

While those stocks are still growing and going up they’re now discovered and mature in the cycle. What are some stocks that you think are at the beginning of the cycle that could set sail like the others we all know by now. The proverbial MSFTs at 50.00 or FB at ipo. And why do you see these as something we’ll see explode over the next decade?"
2024-02-05 12:07:16,dcwhite98,Do you think NVDA will split its stock soon?,"The last time they split it was in the mid $700/share ($748 I think), which it is rapidly approaching again. I know it has no real effect on the value of the company, but splits do often provide a nice bump to the stock price. Not that it needs the help going up... 

What say you? Split or no? If split, what do you think, 3/1, 4/1, something else? "
2024-02-09 17:10:20,zerof3565,"META Still The Cheapest of The Magnificent 7, Am I Wrong?","Quick glance at some of the numbers for META. That EPS is crazy good, going back to the good times of 2021 all over again.

- **Consumer Goods:** Established brands that offer stability.
- **Telecommunications:** The expanding world of connectivity and 5G.
- **Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Autonomous Driving:** The future of transportation.

2024-02-12 09:36:29,EngRookie,Is the S&P500 still a safe bet atm?,"So as I'm sure many are aware a good portion of the growth in SP500 has been driven by the mag6/7 and the companies that support it.

My question is: If the majority of growth in an index that is supposed to represent the broader performance of the market is localized to the tech sector, is it still a safe(r) more reliable investment than individual stock picks in the tech sector? 

Will we see a market correction eventually as small and midsized cap companies aren't performing nearly as well as they are being portrayed? I just see everyone talking about hitting 5k for the first time but I'm like can we really consider this still an effective tool at measuring the broader performance of the market if 6/7 companies account for a min of 25% of total cap. I mean shouldn't we be normalizing the growth to reflect this? I thought the whole point was to measure the performance/health of 500 companies not 30 or less like the dow.

I guess the crux of my question is can we really say that investing in index funds like VOO or VTI is safe(r) or as safe of a bet as it used to be 20/30 years ago? What happens if one of the mag 6/7 goes down? We can't expect the US to continue trade tariff policies and funding/engaging in armed conflicts just to keep a company above foreign competition.

Edited to add: 

some of the comments have acknowledged the near-term risk, which is what I was getting at. I apologize for my question being poorly worded. I know that long term it is safe, but near term (next 1-3 years), am I making a better decision going with individual large cap tech stocks, and then once small and midsized caps start growing again selling and then re-investing in index funds, or spreading out my risk in an index funds now. I know this is all based on personal risk tolerance but I'm just looking to see how others are feeling 

*ATM= at the moment*

Second edit: I was corrected in that the SP500 is solely large cap. And that what I am really talking about is mega cap vs large cap. If I knew how to cross out text on mobile, I would correct it. But still my question remains, how can we include the performance statistics of stocks that are so far removed from the rest of the companies in the SP500? Are we putting too much emphasis on the growth of less than 10 companies when we are talking about the overall ""health of the economy"" ?(SP400 and SP600 are mid and small caps, respectively) 

Third edit: I was reminded that I should state my retirement timeline. At the earliest I'm saying 30 years conservatively (maybe 25 if im really lucky with investments and/or never have children) and 40 at the latest. I would also like to thank everyone for their advice on this as I have realized that I am letting past negative events cloud my judgement too much and that I am probably being impatient and I should just make continual investments in the market every month. And with looking at 20/30yr trends the market has always gone up so even if I had the absolute worst timing if I just keep investing in solid companies/funds by the time I reach retirement I will be set."
2024-02-13 07:09:52,waterlimes,What stocks do you think you'll be kicking yourself for not buying in 5 years time?,"So of course the market has been on a tear recently with the usual tech suspects like nvda powering the index. But what are some 'unloved names' now that aren't getting hype?

Usually the hype only starts after they've had a big run up. But to make real money you ideally get in before that. 

Personally, I think SE is compelling long term at these levels.

2024-02-14 17:14:14,Puginator,"Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company","Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. It’s the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker’s stock soaring.

Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google’s $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.

The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.

Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.

Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques — such as transformer architecture — used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.

Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a “code red” situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.

Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

Effectively what this means is that Intel has more revenue, more shareholder equity, and 1/10 the market cap of NVDA. Their profitability took a huge hit in 2022, but their most recent quarters have seen them return to net positive. A bet on NVDA at this point seems to be a bet on continued parabolic growth and long term sustainability of their insane profit margins. On the other hand, it seems like Intel is undervalued and poised as a possible underdog to step up and take some market share. If the chip sector continues its rally then it seems like INTC could be a good bet. If the entire chip sector crashes and burns, Intel's potential downside is very low, with their stock price only 77% above book value.

Does anyone have any information on Intel and why it might be so undervalued in comparison to other semiconductor stocks?"
2024-03-09 07:10:45,Rav_3d,Biden predicts Federal Reserve will lower interest rates,"In a speech on Friday, Biden “bet” that the Fed would be cutting interest rates soon.

It is extremely rare for a President not named Trump to comment on Federal Reserve policy. This comes after a climax run in NVDA stock and a volatile week that had the market on the cusp of a much needed pause or pullback.

Yet now, if market participants take this comment seriously and believe Biden has inside information about Powell’s plan, the market could surge higher, trapping newly minted shorts, and avert the healthy price action it needs to sustain this bull run for the longer term.

Anyone think Biden’s comments will ignite the market next week? Or will they just ignore this crazy old man?"

2024-04-07 13:21:45,Jumpy-Imagination-81,134 S&P 500 index stocks that have beaten the S&P 500 index,"I wanted to identify stocks that are in the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) index whose total return (with dividends reinvested) has beaten the S&P 500 index either since 1993 or since the stock's IPO (Initial Public Offering) if it was after 1993. I used the ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) SPY as my benchmark for the S&P 500 index because the web site I used to make comparisons [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY) needed an S&P 500 index ETF for comparison, and since SPY - which started in 1993 - is the oldest S&P 500 index, I used SPY and that's why the cutoff is 1993.

I used a stock screener to make a first pass filter, looking for the following criteria:

* Included in the S&P 500 index. This limited the cohort to large. profitable US companies that meet the requirements to be included in the S&P 500 index [https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/) S&P 500 stocks are available as fractional shares at my brokerage Charles Schwab and at other major brokerages.
*  Pays a dividend and has a non-negative 3 year dividend Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). Companies that pay a dividend - and particularly companies that initiated paying a dividend or have been increasing their dividend - have outperformed the S&P 500 index and experienced the highest returns relative to other stocks since 1973—with significantly less volatility.  [https://www.hartfordfunds.com/insights/market-perspectives/equity/the-power-of-dividends.html](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/insights/market-perspectives/equity/the-power-of-dividends.html)
* 5 year total return (with dividends reinvested) close to or better than the 5 year total return of the S&P 500 index. This was to help narrow down the cohort to stocks that have continued good performance in recent years, and to exclude stocks that perhaps were outperforming the S&P 500 many years ago but have been lagging the past 5 years. The 5 year total return of the S&P 500 the past 5 years is +94.69% so I used a minimum of +90% 5 year total return as a cutoff.

I then compared the total return (with dividends reinvested) of the filtered stocks and eliminated any that had a total return less than that of the S&P 500 since 1993, or since the stock's IPO if it was after 1993. Each stock was compared head-to-head against the S&P 500 index (SPY) during equal time frames. For example, this is the comparison of SPY vs MSFT [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,MSFT](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,MSFT) which had its IPO in 1986, and the comparison of SPY vs NVDA [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,NVDA](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,NVDA) which had its IPO in 1999.

I made a spreadsheet of the 134 stocks that meet the criteria. I did this at the end of last month so the results are current as of the end of March 2024. The spreadsheet has the following columns:

* Symbol: self explanatory
* Company: self explanatory
* Total Return: the total return (with dividends reinvested) of the stock since 1993, or since the stock's  IPO if it was after 1993
* S&P 500 TR: the total return of the S&P 500 index (with dividends reinvested) during the exact same time frame displayed for the total return of the stock being compared to the S&P 500 index
* Ratio: the total return of the stock divided by the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time frame. A Ratio of 2 means the stock had 2x the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time period. A Ratio of 10 means the stock had 10x the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time period, and so on. Even a Ratio of 2 is significant because it means the stock had double the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time period.
* 5 Yr Total Return: the total return of the stock the past 5 years. For comparison, the total return of the S&P 500 the past 5 years is +94.69%
* 3 Yr Div Growth Rate: the 3 year dividend Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the stock.  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) represents the year over year rate at which dividends would have grown annually if they had grown at a steady rate over the time period. Steady dividend growth - growth in dividend per share, *not* the dividend yield - is associated with company vitality and is a positive. If a stock has not been paying dividends for at least 3 years the value is blank, but that isn't a negative because it means the stock recently initiated paying a dividend, and that is associated with outperformance.

* Dividend Yield: the current annual dividend yield

The spreadsheet can be sorted by each column to find the highest or lowest values in each column. I colored the highest values in each column in varying shades of green. The darker the shade of green the higher the value range. I did not use rigid criteria for coloring different value ranges, but looked for natural separation points or certain arbitrary values, such as >3 or >200%, etc.

Looking for stocks that are some shade of green in the Ratio AND 5 Yr Total Return AND 3 Yr Div Growth Rate columns can help identify strong performers. For example, familiar stocks like AVGO, AMAT, MSFT, and LLY are green in three columns, but so are lesser known stocks like KLAC, MPWR, PCAR and others.

The spreadsheet:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hh20ZoGg9mOamnSMZcdlOWjSIS9ppthhOI-mgQxe\_pA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hh20ZoGg9mOamnSMZcdlOWjSIS9ppthhOI-mgQxe_pA/edit?usp=sharing)

Yes, past performance is not a *guarantee* of future results, but a stock that has a documented track record of beating the S&P 500 index over an extended period of time is more likely to continue doing so than a stock that has been unable to beat the S&P 500 index over an extended period of time.

I hope this is helpful to people, especially young people looking to explore the universe of individual stocks that exists beyond ETFs."

They take a percentage from your paychecks and purchase shares for you at a discounted price. I was making 9.65 when I started there and 14.50 when I left so that seemed like a high price to pay for something I didn’t really understand. Stock was around 25 when I started there in 2009 and about 150 when I left in 2017. Based on the average stock price and my average pay throughout my time there, if I would have contributed 10% of every paycheck I would have paid roughly 15k for about 400 shares. That 15k contribution would have been worth over $126,000 today. And these are just rough numbers based off of the public stock price, not the discounted price I would have been able to purchase the stock at. It very well may be closer to 200k. 

That same guy was always talking to me about Roth IRA and 401k like “you’re young if you start it now and don’t even look at it for the next 20 years, it’s going to be way more money you’ll have when you retire.” Now I’m the 30 something year old trying to convince these kids I work with to start contributing to their Roth and invest while they’re in their early 20’s rather than waiting like I did.

I began investing in 2017. I wanted to buy Apple and Microsoft, but he told me they were too high, and I should wait for a crash. And he wouldn't shut up about the coming crash. I guess I internalized what he was saying and ended up focusing on ""cheap"" stocks and ""value investing.""

7 years later, my portfolio is -5%.

I didn't have enough money to buy the dip in 2020 because all of my money was tied up in stuff like $WBA, $SPG, and $SJM. Lol.

Only these past two years, I started to shift strategies and buy good businesses with actual prospects. That's why I'm down only -5% rather than -35%.

I'm just ranting. I can't believe I wasted so much time researching ""undervalued"" companies and couldn't even beat cash interest. I'm only 29 at least, so hopefully I can still grow my portfolio. But I missed out on some of the best years of the S&P...

Oh yeah, I'm holding some NVDA and yesterday my dad was screaming at me to sell, and how it's too high, and ""it can't go up forever."" I was really annoyed, so I created the image above and sent it to him.

Oh, he also lost hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past 30 years. I grew up watching my parents fight over money all the time. Don't know why I ever listened to him.

I did make plenty of my own mistakes, of course. And it's ultimately my fault for following his advice. I think I've learned a lot so I don't feel as much of a need to rely on other people anymore. I guess I'm just really annoyed that he's still saying the same thing as he did back then.

2024-05-25 06:17:13,PartyNightAway,How did people find out about NVDA?,i’m kind of new to investing and I’ve been browsing other subreddits. The stock NVDA keeps popping up pretty frequently. I saw a post where several people said they bought the stock for $150 or $250 and now it is well over 1K. My question is how did people find out about this stock and why did they think it was going to do so great? Can someone fill me in.
2024-05-26 11:41:26,nams0,"Realistically, how high can NVDA actually go at this point?","Currently Nvidia has a market cap of 2.62T, making it the 3rd largest market cap company in US. This follows Microsoft at 3.19T and Apple at 2.91T. If Nvidia were to become #1 in market cap, which looks like that's going to happen soon, that would be about 22% increase in its stock price. But beyond that, how realistic is it for this company to keep growing up to 4T market cap and beyond? Are the prospects seriously that good? To hit 4T, Nvidia stock would need to rise by another 50%. I just can't see how that is going to happen. How can Nvidia, which really is just a company that makes GPUs and drives, end up being more valuable than Microsoft, Apple, and Google in the long term? Nvidia has a fantastic business model and ridiculous profit margins, but it still seems unrealistic to me for it's share price to keep growing and growing to a record high market cap at this point.

My gut feels like there is far too much hype surrounding Nvidia's prospects and price should drop a fair bit. I think it's too risky to buy in now and that after the stock split we will start seeing a correction. Thoughts?

2024-06-09 08:11:21,Think_Ad8198,Bear Case: Why I believe Alphabet will do everything right and still lose,"Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors, but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue.

With the ""Attention is all you need"" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch.

But even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift.

Much of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo.

Ultimately, Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive, but without a massive moat in a crucial industry, it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META, MSFT, and NVDA."

2024-06-17 10:15:52,StatQuants,"Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund","KEY POINTS

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)’s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday’s close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia’s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

“Understanding how they might be weighted, where they’re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what’s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,” Bartolini said.

The fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.

The free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.

“Its free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,” Bartolini said.

The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.

On Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.

2024-06-19 04:48:56,nuttybudd,Most stocks hyped as winners from AI boom have fallen this year,"Source: https://www.ft.com/content/1e02d0d3-3f0b-4bd1-a79c-9fd45d1b6056

Most of the stocks that were caught up in last year’s hype around artificial intelligence have fallen this year, suggesting that investors are increasingly trying to separate the wheat from the chaff among companies claiming to be beneficiaries of the AI trend.

Massive share price rallies for high-profile groups such as Nvidia, the chip designer that this week became the world’s most valuable listed company, have spurred a growing debate about whether the US stock market is being driven by speculative hype.

But the recent declines for dozens of stocks that had benefited from the early enthusiasm suggest that investors are starting to look past optimistic commentary if the companies cannot back up their claims.

“AI is still a big theme but if you can’t demonstrate evidence you’re getting hurt,” said Stuart Kaiser, head of US equity trading strategy at Citi. “Just saying ‘AI’ 15 times is not going to cut it any more.”

About 60 per cent of stocks in the S&P 500 have risen this year, but more than half the stocks included in Citi’s “AI Winners Basket” — an index based on the names that were garnering the most excitement among the bank’s clients last year — have declined. More than three-quarters of companies in the AI basket had climbed in 2023.

Investment funds that tried to pick a wide spread of AI beneficiaries have had a similar experience. More than half of the individual stocks in BlackRock’s Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF, Invesco’s AI and Next Gen Software fund, and First Trust and Nasdaq’s Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF have declined this year.

Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, said: “Investors are looking a bit more at the earnings story among ‘AI’ names. The differentiator with something like a Nvidia is they have delivered on the bottom line, showing real data.”

Nvidia has more than doubled in value this year, after more than tripling in 2023, and its market cap is now well over $3tn. However, the massive demand for its graphics processing units is such that, measured as a multiple of its sales over the previous 12 months, the stock is actually cheaper than this time last year. 

In contrast, tech groups such as Salesforce, Snowflake, Intel and Adobe — now far smaller than Nvidia by market value, but classed as large-cap stocks — have fallen sharply after strong gains in 2023.

“In tech the bar was quite high [in earnings season] and if you missed that bar you got hit hard,” said Citi’s Kaiser. Salesforce suffered its worst one-day drop in 20 years after publishing a disappointing quarterly update last month.

Although some have taken the shift as a sign of rationality returning, Rob Arnott, chair of asset manager Research Affiliates, said the AI-linked rally still “has the look to me of a classic bubble”.

“One of the things about a classic bubble is you do see smaller players fade before big ones start to suffer,” he said.

Arnott stressed that he was a believer in the long-term impact of AI, but said “a lot of the benefits are going to come gradually, and the market is pricing in immediacy”."

Nvidia said it was on track to ramp up production of its most advanced artificial intelligence chip, following reports of a delay in its launch due to design flaws.

Tech journal The Information had reported that design flaws on its new Blackwell chip could cause a delay of three months or more and the setback could affect customers such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft, which have collectively ordered tens of billions of US dollars' worth of chips.

The chip giant's Blackwell series succeeds its earlier flagship AI chip, the Grace Hopper Superchip.

2024-08-13 14:03:15,Fidler_2K,Bloomberg: US Considers a Rare Antitrust Move: Breaking Up Google,"A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.’s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.

The move would be Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.

Regardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google’s web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said.

The Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta’s Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government’s proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request.

Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses.

A Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment.

The US plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s.

Justice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google’s practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company’s search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google’s AI products in order to appear in search results.

**Breakup**

Divesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that’s been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store.

Those agreements also require that Google’s search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can’t be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found.

Mehta’s decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn’t yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn’t be allowed “to reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.”

Google paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc.

Mehta’s ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google’s total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year’s trial.

If the Justice Department doesn’t call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said.

**Data Access**

Another option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft’s Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta’s ruling found that Google’s contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data – 16 times as much as its next closest competitor — but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively.

Europe’s recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds.

Requiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department’s first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents.

In the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other.

**AI Products**

For years, websites have allowed Google’s web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company’s search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI.

Last fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn’t apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with “AI Overviews,” narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web.

Google doesn’t allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a “feature” of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews.

While AI Overviews only appear on a fraction of searches, the feature’s roll-out has been rocky after some excerpts offered embarrassing suggestions, like advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza.

Of course, some have performed great, largely because my timing, mid-2022, was an excellent entry point. But of course, I can't help brag about my selection choice. For example, Qualcomm, AMD, JPM, MSFT, GOOG, Citi.

I (think), I hit most of the semiconductor names, except NVDA. For some reason, it never felt like a good investment. I have my skepticism about LLMs and Gen-AI hype. Besides, generating cat pics or idle plays with Chat-GPT, I haven't ***yet*** seen a business effectively using Gen-AI as a compelling competitive edge. So, please educate me here as well. AMD is different because of data center servers product line - which is more solid story.

Besides missing such obvious biggies, not all of what I touched has performed. I felt, European carmakers (BMW, VW, MBG) were deep value at PE 3-5 and 8-9% yields, but obviously I was wrong. They were cheap for a reason.

**Main question** - I was wondering if I can do a simulation of hypothetical scenario where I had simply invested in index, saving me enormous time in research. If so, please suggest tools/sites?

Note that the amounts and time of entry/exit are not constant, so I can't use the simple lumpsum or periodic investing calculators that assume regular constant amounts and intervals.

With 50 stocks in my portfolio, I wonder if it is just mirroring the index, or generating any real alpha. Obviously, when I buy something, I am highly convinced of my reasonings. So, it's hard to part with what I feel are ""my gems"". How do you cope with these emotional aspects of investing?"

As someone who just started learning about investing ands stocks, I came across many people saying that ""September is the worst month for stocks"". So this got me wondering: if we know that September has had a bad history for a long time, what stops people from just selling all(or at least most of) their stocks for the month and buying them back towards the end of the month?

The possibilities that I thought of were:

1. It doesn't matter for long term investors (wouldn't it be better to keep your number as it is than to have it drop a few %?)
2. The past is not an indicator of the future (even though that does seem to be a strong trend?)
3. You may miss out on a possible positive return (I think this relates to the issue of ""trying to time the market"" which I would find valid for long term investors.)

Are there any other reasons for this, such as taxes or other complicated issues I am not aware of?

2024-09-04 06:00:41,Fidler_2K,[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.

The tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

Reuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.

""Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,"" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. ""There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.""

A Broadcom spokesperson said the company is ""evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.""

Intel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.

Broadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.

Some of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.

**CRUCIAL SETBACK**

As part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.

Intel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.

Intel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.

Typically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.

Broadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.

For an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.

TSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.

Moving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.

Betting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.

Intel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.

The company plans to be ""manufacturing-ready"" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers ""actively engaged"" with the tool kit.

2024-09-14 07:58:14,foo-bar-nlogn-100,NVDA Bear Case | AI Bubble Collapse | Falsifying the Scalability Hypothesis | Thematics,"# Background

 The AI scaling hypothesis is a key concept in artificial intelligence research that suggests improvements in AI capabilities can be achieved primarily by increasing the size and computational resources of AI models. We can understand several aspects of this hypothesis:

Key Points of the AI Scaling Hypothesis

1. **Emergence of Capabilities**: As AI models grow larger and are trained on more data, they tend to develop new capabilities that were not explicitly programmed. This emergence of novel abilities is a central tenet of the scaling hypothesis.
2. **Generalization**: Larger models demonstrate improved ability to generalize across different tasks and domains, often showing surprising competence in areas they were not specifically trained for.
3. **Efficiency in Learning**: Scaled-up models can learn more efficiently from limited data, sometimes matching or surpassing the performance of smaller, task-specific models with just a few examples.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: The hypothesis suggests that continuing to scale up models will lead to further improvements in AI performance and capabilities, potentially approaching or even surpassing human-level abilities in various domains.

# Hyperscalers and First Mover Advantage

The scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind many recent advancements in AI, including large language models and multimodal AI systems. However, it's important to note that while scaling has proven effective, it also comes with challenges such as increased computational requirements and potential biases in large datasets.

Hyperscalers are racing to scale their AI capabilities and be ***the first to discover emergent properties for several compelling reasons at any cost. This is the main driver in the billions of capital expenditures over the last 18 months.*** At the forefront is the significant competitive advantage that comes with pioneering new AI capabilities in the fast-evolving tech landscape. Being first allows these companies to establish market dominance, attract and retain customers seeking cutting-edge AI solutions, and gain valuable insights from early deployments. This advantage is not merely about prestige; it translates directly into substantial economic benefits.

The economic incentives driving this race are staggering. Industry projections suggest that AI technology in data centers alone could drive spending of up to $2 trillion over the next five years. Additionally, the AI silicon market is expected to reach $400 billion by 2027. These figures underscore the massive financial opportunity that awaits those who lead in AI capabilities. Hyperscalers are positioning themselves to capitalize on the growing demand for custom AI silicon and infrastructure, potentially securing a significant share of this burgeoning market.

The rush to scale is also fueled by the promise of technological breakthroughs. ***The AI scaling hypothesis suggests that continued increases in model size and computational resources will lead to the emergence of novel capabilities not explicitly programmed, improved generalization across different tasks and domains, and more efficient learning from limited data***\*.\* This potential for transformative advancements keeps hyperscalers intensely focused on pushing the boundaries of AI scale.

Hyperscalers are uniquely positioned in this race due to their existing infrastructure advantages. They possess the necessary computational resources, data centers, and cloud infrastructure that can be leveraged for AI training and deployment. This allows them to offer scalable AI services to a wide range of customers, from individuals to large enterprises, further cementing their market position.

Strategically, leading in AI capabilities allows hyperscalers to shape the future direction of AI development and applications, influence industry standards, and attract top AI talent and research partnerships. The potential for breakthrough discoveries, including the possibility of approaching or surpassing human-level abilities in various domains or even developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), adds another layer of motivation to their efforts.

# Falsifying the Scalability Hypothesis

The AI scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind many recent advancements in artificial intelligence, but there are compelling arguments for how it could potentially be falsified

One primary method would be ***to demonstrate diminishing returns as models are scaled up in size and computational resources.*** ***If performance gains plateau or even decline rather than continuing to improve linearly or superlinearly, it would suggest fundamental limits to scaling***. This could be coupled with identifying qualitative gaps – cognitive abilities or tasks that larger models consistently fail at, even as they improve on other benchmarks. Such findings would indicate that some fundamental capabilities are missing and cannot be addressed by pure scaling alone.

# Simple Bench

Simple bench is the only reasoning benchmark written in natural language at which English-speaking humans (and yes, even 'smart highschoolers') can score 90%+, while frontier LLMs get less than 50%. It is an encapsulation of the reasoning deficit found in AI like ChatGPT.

 What the benchmark does is take a standard kind of logic puzzle that people ask LLM's, then spikes it with a ""surprise twist"" that requires what we would think of as common sense.  Thus an AI has more difficulty in predicting the next tokens because of the twist.  But humans can still reason out an answer.

These questions are fully private, preventing contamination, and have been vetted by PhDs from multiple domains, as well as the author - Philip, from AI Explained - who first exposed the numerous errors in the MMLU (Aug 2023). \[https://simple-bench.com/about.html\]

***These large AI companies don’t disclose training parameter sizes because we can graph training size vs benchmark score to falsify the scalability hypothesis.***

The AI scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind significant advancements in artificial intelligence, propelling the development of increasingly powerful models and fueling a race among hyperscalers to achieve breakthrough capabilities. This hypothesis has led to remarkable improvements in AI performance across various domains, from natural language processing to computer vision and beyond.

However, as we delve deeper into the realm of large-scale AI models, we are beginning to encounter signs that suggest the scaling hypothesis may have limitations. The emergence of benchmarks like Simple Bench, which reveal persistent reasoning deficits in even the most advanced language models, indicates that simply increasing model size and computational resources may not be sufficient to achieve human-level reasoning capabilities.

The reluctance of major AI companies to disclose training parameter sizes for their latest models adds another layer of intrigue to this discussion. ***This lack of transparency makes it challenging for the broader scientific community to accurately assess the relationship between model scale and performance, potentially hindering efforts to validate or falsify the scaling hypothesis.***

Moreover, the increasing costs associated with training and deploying ever-larger models, coupled with concerns about data scarcity and computational limitations, raise questions about the long-term sustainability of the scaling approach. As we approach these practical and theoretical limits, it becomes clear that the future of AI advancement may require more than just scaling up existing architectures.

Looking ahead, the field of AI research may need to pivot towards more innovative approaches that focus on qualitative improvements in model architecture, training methodologies, and data utilization. The development of more sophisticated benchmarks, like Simple Bench, that can effectively measure complex reasoning abilities will be crucial in guiding these efforts.

Ultimately, while the scaling hypothesis has undoubtedly driven remarkable progress in AI, its limitations are becoming increasingly apparent. The next frontier in AI research may lie not in building ever-larger models, but in developing more efficient, adaptable, and truly intelligent systems that can match or exceed human-level reasoning across a wide range of tasks. This shift could lead to a new paradigm in AI development, one that combines the insights gained from scaling with novel approaches to create more capable and robust artificial intelligence.

# AI Bubble Collapse and Trillions in Misallocated Capital

 The AI scaling hypothesis has been the cornerstone of recent advancements in artificial intelligence, driving unprecedented investments and fueling a race among tech giants to build ever-larger models. However, as we stand on the precipice of a potential paradigm shift, the falsification of this hypothesis could trigger a seismic disruption in the AI industry, potentially leading to the collapse of what many now recognize as an AI bubble.

The signs of this impending crisis are becoming increasingly apparent. Benchmarks like Simple Bench are exposing critical reasoning deficits in even the most advanced language models, defying the expectation that larger models inherently lead to more intelligent systems. The reluctance of major AI companies to disclose training parameter sizes for their latest models further fuels suspicion that the relationship between scale and performance may not be as straightforward as once believed.

 As the evidence mounts against the scaling hypothesis, we must confront the sobering reality of the potential misallocation of trillions of dollars in capital. Hyperscalers and investors have poured vast resources into the development of massive data centers, custom AI chips, and enormous models, all predicated on the belief that bigger is inherently better. If this foundational assumption proves false, the repercussions will be far-reaching and profound.

The collapse of the AI bubble, triggered by the falsification of the scaling hypothesis, could lead to:

1.  A dramatic reassessment of the valuations of AI-focused companies, potentially wiping out billions in market capitalization.

2.  A crisis of confidence in the AI industry, leading to a sharp decline in investment and a potential ""AI winter.""

**This potential collapse serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of putting too much faith in a single hypothesis**, no matter how compelling it may seem. It underscores the critical importance of diverse approaches in AI research and the need for rigorous, independent verification of claims made by industry leaders.

2024-09-20 08:12:40,foo-bar-nlogn-100,NVDA Bear Case | AI Bubble Collapse | Financial Round Tripping | Thematics,"# Background

It's crucial to understand the concept of financial round-tripping and its implications for the market. Round-tripping is a deceptive practice that has gained notoriety in recent years due to its potential to mislead investors and manipulate financial statements. This fraudulent technique involves creating artificial transactions between two or more entities to inflate revenues, evade taxes, or present a false picture of financial health.

Typically, round-tripping occurs when a company sells an asset to another entity while simultaneously agreeing to buy back the same or a similar asset at approximately the same price. This creates the illusion of bustling business activity and growth, which can be particularly attractive to speculative investors. However, these transactions lack genuine economic substance and violate the fundamental accounting principle of substance over form. Round-tripping has been implicated in several high-profile financial scandals, including those involving energy traders like Enron and CMS Energy, as well as financial service providers such as Wirecard. As an investment advisor, it's essential to be vigilant and look for red flags that might indicate round-tripping, such as unusually high revenue growth without corresponding increases in cash flow or profit margins.

**The practice of major tech companies providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting growth in datacenter and AI usage can indeed be viewed as a form of financial round-tripping**. This strategy raises significant concerns about the authenticity of reported revenue growth, as it creates a cycle where investments return as revenue, inflating metrics without genuine market expansion.

# History of Financial Round Tripping in Tech

 Over the past 20 years, several high-profile cases of round-tripping have emerged in the technology sector, highlighting the prevalence of this deceptive practice. Here are some notable examples:

# Enron Scandal (2001)

While not strictly a tech company, Enron's collapse involved significant round-tripping in energy trading. The company engaged in numerous sham transactions with special purpose entities to inflate revenues and hide debt. These transactions involved selling assets to these entities and then buying them back at similar prices, creating the illusion of bustling business activity.

# Global Crossing (2002)

This telecommunications company was accused of swapping network capacity with other carriers to artificially boost revenue. Global Crossing would sell capacity on its network to another carrier while simultaneously buying an equal amount of capacity from that carrier, with no money changing hands. This practice inflated reported revenues without generating actual cash flow.

# Qwest Communications (2002-2004)

The telecom giant was found to have engaged in round-trip transactions involving the swapping of fiber-optic capacity with other companies. These deals were structured to appear as legitimate sales and purchases, but in reality, they were designed to inflate revenues artificially.

# Computer Associates (2004)

The software company was involved in a $2.2 billion accounting fraud that included round-tripping. They used a practice called the ""35-day month,"" where they kept their books open for an extra few days to record additional revenue from the next quarter, creating a perpetual cycle of inflated earnings.

# Nortel Networks (2007)

The Canadian telecommunications equipment manufacturer was found to have engaged in various accounting irregularities, including round-tripping. They manipulated revenue recognition by recording sales to distributors as final sales, even when the products were likely to be returned.

# Wirecard (2020)

While not exclusively a tech company, Wirecard was a major player in digital payment processing. The company was found to have engaged in massive fraud, including round-tripping transactions. They created fake customer accounts and used a network of partner companies to simulate legitimate business activities, inflating their reported revenues and cash balances.

These examples demonstrate that round-tripping has been a persistent issue in the tech sector, often used to artificially inflate revenues, manipulate stock prices, and deceive investors. The complex nature of technology businesses and their often intangible assets can make it easier to engage in such deceptive practices. However, increased regulatory scrutiny and improved auditing practices have made it more challenging for companies to engage in round-tripping without detection. 

# AI Labs Round Tripping

 

The practice of major tech companies providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting growth in datacenter and AI usage can indeed be viewed as a form of financial round-tripping. This strategy raises significant concerns about the authenticity of reported revenue growth, as it creates a cycle where investments return as revenue, inflating metrics without genuine market expansion.

# Artificial Inflation of Revenue

When tech giants invest in AI startups or provide them with datacenter credits, they essentially create a loop where their initial financial outlay returns to them as revenue. This cycle artificially inflates their cloud and AI service usage metrics, presenting an illusion of robust growth. For example, companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) have invested billions in AI firms like Anthropic, which then become major consumers of AWS's cloud services. This arrangement leads to an inflated perception of demand for these services, despite the fact that the growth is internally generated rather than stemming from new market participants.

# Lack of Economic Substance

These transactions often lack real economic substance because the AI labs are primarily spending money provided by the tech companies themselves. This means that instead of attracting new, independent customers or generating fresh revenue streams, the tech companies are simply cycling their own funds back into their revenue reports. Such practices can mislead stakeholders into believing that there is a substantial increase in market demand when, in reality, the growth is not driven by external factors.

# Misleading Market Perception

# Inflated Growth Figures

By reporting increased usage of their cloud and AI services due to these internal transactions, tech companies create a misleading picture of sector growth. This self-generated growth does not reflect broader market demand but rather a strategic manipulation to enhance financial statements. As highlighted by industry analysts, this practice can give an impression of thriving business activity that may not exist.

# Skewed Competition Metrics

This practice also distorts the competitive landscape by making it appear that certain companies are outperforming others in attracting AI business. In reality, these companies are subsidizing usage through investments and credits, which can skew competition metrics and obscure true market dynamics.

# Financial Interdependence

The symbiotic relationship created between tech giants and AI labs through these arrangements can lead to reduced innovation. AI labs may become overly reliant on specific cloud providers for resources, limiting their ability to explore diverse technological solutions. Additionally, this interdependence can result in conflicts of interest in the development and deployment of AI technologies, as the success of the startups becomes closely tied to the continued support from their benefactor companies.

# Regulatory and Accounting Concerns

# Revenue Recognition Issues

Questions arise regarding how these transactions should be accounted for. If a company invests in an AI startup and subsequently recognizes revenue from that startup's usage of its services, it creates a complex accounting situation that may not accurately reflect the company's true financial position. This ambiguity opens up potential for manipulation, as companies could use these arrangements to meet growth targets or analyst expectations.

# Potential for Manipulation

The practice opens the door for potential manipulation of financial statements. Companies might engage in these arrangements to artificially boost reported revenues, thereby meeting or exceeding market expectations without actual underlying business growth.

# Market Distortion

This practice can lead to a distorted view of the AI and cloud computing markets. By overestimating market size and growth rates based on inflated projections from round-tripping deals, resources may be misallocated. This could potentially create an AI bubble driven by circular investments rather than genuine demand. 

# Conclusion

In conclusion, while providing resources to AI labs can drive innovation, the current practice of offering datacenter credits and reporting resulting usage as growth shares similarities with financial round-tripping. It raises significant concerns about transparency, authenticity in corporate reporting, and potential distortions in market perceptions within the AI and cloud computing sectors.

# TLDR;

The practice of tech giants providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting the resulting usage as growth is essentially a modern form of financial round-tripping. This deceptive cycle artificially inflates revenue and usage metrics, creating a false perception of market demand. It distorts the competitive landscape, potentially stifles innovation, and raises serious regulatory concerns. Most alarmingly, it could be fueling an AI bubble based on circular investments rather than genuine market growth. Investors and regulators should be wary of this practice, as it may be masking the true state of the AI and cloud computing markets, potentially leading to misallocation of resources and inflated valuations in the tech sector."

""Blackwell is in full production,"" Huang said Wednesday during an interview with CNBC. ""Blackwell is as planned, and the demand for Blackwell is insane. Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.""


The Blackwell GPUs are already being released to data centers and industrial customers for artificial intelligence applications. They will be available for consumers in 2025.


""The thing that we have done with Blackwell, and what we have announced, is there is new Al infrastructure generation every year,"" Huang said. ""So, we're updating our platform every single year. If we can increase the performance, like we've done for Hopper and Blackwell ... we're effectively increasing the revenue or throughput for our customers on these infrastructures by a couple to three times each year.""


Hyperscalers are expected to spend about $160B in 2024 on Al infrastructure. Every frontier large language model requires many times more compute power than the one prior.


""At a time when technology is moving so fast, it gives us an opportunity to triple down and to really drive the innovation cycle so that we can increase capabilities, increase our throughput, decrease our costs, decrease our energy consumption,"" Huang added."

Current P/E, P/S and most metrics point to stellar growth expectations. If that's the case, why is $200 Call for June 2026 priced 'just' at $15. $240 Call (double of current price) is trading at $10.

[NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Options Chain - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/options/?date=1781740800) 

It's an almost certainty that NVDA should double in next 18 months, or even sooner. So why wouldn't someone just get this option for $10, and free up his $110 capital for something else?

I know, the option can become worthless if price stays below $240. But if I am getting into something as volatile as NVDA, I'm looking to 2X my capital; and not 'normal' 20-30% gains. So, isn't it better to just ""throw"" $10 at NVDA option, if the end-result is basically the same as investing $120 in it?"

TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales. If TSMC reports strong earnings, it could indicate robust demand for semiconductors, which is crucial since NVIDIA relies heavily on TSMC for manufacturing its GPUs. Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA.

Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may *revise* their ratings or ***price targets*** for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a **spike** in NVDA’s stock price. 

Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors. Reports indicate that TSMC is now able to ship more chips than ever before.

Do you believe TSMC’s earnings will positively impact NVIDIA? Are you planning to make any moves based on this news? Let’s discuss!

*On October 24, 2024, Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) sent the members of the Audit Committee a letter of resignation as the Company’s registered public accounting firm (the “Resignation Letter”).*  
  
*The Chair of the Audit Committee discussed with EY the reasons for EY’s resignation. The Company has begun the process of identifying a successor independent registered public accounting firm. The Company will authorize EY to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor independent registered public accounting firm, once selected. The Company does not currently expect that resolution of any of the matters raised by EY, or under consideration by the Special Committee, as noted below, will result in any restatements of its quarterly reports for the fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, or for prior fiscal years.*  
  
*EY was engaged on March 15, 2023 to perform an audit for the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, and has not issued any report on the Company’s financial statements or the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. EY resigned while conducting the audit for the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, EY’s first audit on the Company’s behalf.*  
  
*In late July 2024, EY communicated to the Audit Committee concerns about several matters relating to governance, transparency and completeness of communications to EY, and other matters pertaining to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and that the timely filing of the Company’s annual report was at significant risk. In response, the Board appointed an independent special committee of the Board (the “Special Committee”) to review the matters and certain of the Company’s internal controls and certain governance procedures (the “Review”). The Special Committee engaged Cooley LLP, and forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors, LLC to perform an investigation on behalf of and at the direction of the Special Committee. EY and the Board received updates with preliminary information relating to the Review. As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Review remains ongoing and final findings and recommendations have not yet been communicated to EY or the Board.*  
  
*After receiving additional information through the Review process, EY informed the Special Committee that the additional information EY received raised questions, including about whether the Company demonstrates a commitment to integrity and ethical values consistent with Principle 1 of the COSO Framework, about the ability and willingness of the Audit Committee and overall Board to demonstrate and act as an oversight body that is independent of the CEO and other members of management in accordance with Principle 2 of the COSO Framework, and whether EY could rely on representations from certain members of management and from the Audit Committee. In the Resignation Letter, EY stated, in part: “we are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.”*  
  
*Although the Company recognizes EY’s decision is final, it disagrees with EY’s decision to resign as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm – the Special Committee has not yet obtained all information relevant for the Review and has not concluded the Review. Nevertheless, the Company has taken the concerns expressed by EY seriously, and will carefully consider the findings of the Special Committee and any remedial or other actions recommended by the Special Committee following conclusion of the Review.*  
  
*Other than as described above, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the subsequent interim period preceding EY’s resignation, (1) there were no “disagreements,” as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, with EY on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which if not resolved to EY’s satisfaction to our knowledge would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter thereof in connection with its report, and (2) there were no “reportable events” as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.*  
  
*The Company has provided EY with a copy of the disclosures required by Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K contained in Item 4.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and has requested that EY furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the Company’s statements made in response to those requirements and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of EY’s letter, dated October 29, 2024, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.*"

2024-10-31 17:44:41,Puginator,Amazon CEO pledges AI investments will pay off as capital expenditures surge 81%,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is trying to reassure investors who may be worried about the future payoff of the company’s massive investments in generative artificial intelligence.

On a conference call with analysts following the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Thursday, Jassy pointed to the success of Amazon’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, which has become a crucial profit engine despite the extreme costs associated with building data centers.

“I think we’ve proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business,” Jassy said. “We expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI.”

Amazon spent $22.6 billion on property and equipment during the quarter, up 81% from the year before. Jassy said Amazon plans to spend $75 billion on capex in 2024 and expects an even higher number in 2025.

The jump in spending is primarily being driven by generative AI investments, Jassy said. The company is rushing to invest in data centers, networking gear and hardware to meet vast demand for the technology, which has exploded in popularity since OpenAI released its ChatGPT assistant almost two years ago.

“It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity,” Jassy said. “And I think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long term that we’re aggressively pursuing it.”

AI spending was a big topic on tech earnings calls this week. Meta on Wednesday raised its capital expenditures guidance, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was “quite happy” with the team’s execution. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI weighed on its fiscal first-quarter earnings released on Wednesday, and the company said capital spending would continue to rise. A day earlier, Alphabet CFO Anat Ashkenazi warned the company expects capital spending to grow in 2025.

Amazon has said its cloud unit has picked up more business from companies that need infrastructure to deploy generative AI models. It’s also launched several AI products for enterprises, third-party sellers on its marketplace and advertisers in recent months. The company is expected to announce a souped-up version of its Alexa voice assistant that incorporates generative AI, something Jassy said will arrive “in the near future.”

Amazon hasn’t disclosed its revenue from generative AI, but Jassy said Thursday it’s become a “multi-billion-dollar revenue run rate” business within AWS that “continues to grow at a triple-digit year-over-year percentage.”

“It’s growing more than three times faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew, and we felt like AWS grew pretty quickly,” he added.

Post-January, we're likely to be entering a period of increased tensions with China. This seems bad for Nvidia in multiple ways.

1. Beijing has previously expressed desire to urgently switch away from NVDA chips and invest locally. Obviously that's easier said than done, but with China being such a huge market for NVDA, increased tensions over tariffs could push this mandate further. The amount of revenue NVDA gets from China has already decreased, but this further deceleration could be negative. [https://archive.is/v40zX](https://archive.is/v40zX)

  
2. Trump has accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry. He wants to put tariffs on chips from Taiwan. Obviously, everyone is relying on TSMC, so this seems clearly bad news.

I'm completely open to being told I'm wrong and being called a moron, but please don't spam downvote if you disagree with my take. This is a popular stock on this subreddit, and others will have similar posts. 



Let's just get this discussion over with now, yeah?"
2024-11-11 12:21:20,floorborgmic,NVDA has become the largest position in retail portfolios in the first half of the year,"Data on the 15 most widely held stocks and ETFs in retail portfolios and sorted by weight, NVDA tops the list with a 9.3% weighting over other popular stocks. Such as Apple, S&P 500 EFT, Tesla, Nasdaq 100 EFF, Meta, and others.

This compares to NVDA's 4.2% weighting in the average retail portfolio a year ago

NVDA's popularity is largely due to its rapidly rising stock price, earnings reports that have repeatedly beaten expectations, and retail investors' preference for tech stocks - over the past year, NVDA's stock price has risen 203%, and in the second quarter, NVDA's revenues of $30 billion were up 15% sequentially and 122% year-on-year, well above the $28 billion estimate"
2024-11-12 08:05:41,S_H_R_O_O_M_S999,Out of the “Big 7” any you’d recommend buying over others?,"Wanna buy 2-3 of the big 7 stocks, atm thinking of google, Nvidia, and maybe another.
All these stocks are at the highest they’ve ever been basically so maybe not best to buy but who knows if the market will keep climbing so I’ll buy and hold for probably 2 years at least. If I need to hold longer for that I probably can. I’m somewhat new to investing so just wanna see y’all’s thoughts. Should I just wait? That would be timing the market and seems like a bad idea haha. Buying now and averaging my price down if need be sounds smarter."
2024-11-12 12:41:34,Janq55,Chipotle (CMG) vs NVIDIA (NVDA) growth for 2025,"When both companies went through a stock split early this year (CMG was north of $3,000 and NVDA north of $1,200) I jumped on a few shares as both companies had tremendous growth. CMG stock has increased 250% past couple years, and plans to open between 285 and 315 new restaurants next year, and get into some international markets for the first time, it has experienced revenue growth that even big places like Taco Bell and McDonalds haven’t seen with fewer locations. NVDA has been deemed the most valuable company, AI is the wave of the digital future with NVDA leading the charge, and CMG just makes burritos and bowls but great P/E ratio and same-store sales. Both are two totally different markets and all, but am considering selling my CMG share and dumping them in NVDA. Thoughts? "
2024-11-13 14:52:30,Puginator,"AMD to lay off 4% of workforce, or about 1,000 employees","AMD said on Wednesday that it will lay off 4% of its global staff as the longtime computer chipmaker seeks to gain a stronger foothold in the growing artificial intelligence chip space dominated by Nvidia.

*″*As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,” an AMD representative said in a statement. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.”

AMD had 26,000 employees at the end of last year, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

AMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

AMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers, including the MI300X, which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

AMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD’s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.

GPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD’s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

AMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research.
