2023-11-18 16:07:24,ivanpd,What does TESLA's settlement mean for stockholders?,"My girlfriend received a [notice regarding C.A. No. 2020-0477-KSJM](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017023033695/tsla-ex99_1.htm).

She already sold her stock. If I understand correctly (and please correct me if I'm mistaken), as a result of the settlement, the directors will have to pay some money back to the company. That could, in turn, affect the stock price.

Since she already sold her stock, one could argue that the company was valued lower than it should have been at the time she sold, because the company had 700M less in cash. 1) can she get any of the money being returned, 2) will she do so if she doesn't do anything in response to this notice, or 2) does she need to do anything to try and get some of that?"

2023-12-08 05:30:33,ImAMindlessTool,AMD and its (impressive?) P/E ratio,"I have a watchlist of 8 tech stocks and I was comparing the P/E ratios.  I see AMDs is largely out of place @ 1,084.39.  The other 7 (APPL, NVDA, GOOG, NVDA, TSLA, META, MSFT) and on average their P/E ratio is 48 (26:78).

So what gives?  Online I am reading that P/E is a gauge of investor sentiment on future growth in earning potential and is calculated based on prior 12 months of earnings.  AMDs P/E seems remarkable by comparison.  Does this not indicate that AMD is overbought?

edit: I was considering AMD for investment, given recent company news and its momentum has largely been positive over the long-term.  This number stands out to me, and it isn't a positive indicator in my mind.  Looking to reconcile my opinion after hearing some of yours - thanks!"

2023-12-31 04:17:23,vividdreamfinland,"EUR 25000 in cash to invest, what's the quickest way to EUR 1M","I am 45M. 

For a long time, I kept my head in the sand about investing. Mutual funds, stocks, deposits - all were alien to me. Now that I read ""Time in the market > timing the market"", I feel left out, and regret what I could have achieved if I had woken up earlier.

I have a EUR 8000 invested in a semiconductor fund that stands at 35% returns today - not bad. But far from enough.

Due to career volatility, not much in pension fund. Health is fine, as of now. The goal is to retire from 9-5 as early as possible, and start something that I love. 

To inflate side income, there were so many things I wanted to try, and I simply wasted my time exploring them. Only now I am waking to investment, something that could have truly helped me achieve my goal)

As I read, the only way to make big wealth is to start early and exploit compounding - not something I have on my side. The only way is to pick better chips and forget about it for some time. 

S & P 500 is on my list. Are there other/better instruments?

I get that diversifying (in bonds, savings deposits) for security at this age is paramount. 

Still, moderate risk is something I am not willing to rule out - anything for early independence."

I'm a relatively new investor, particularly focussing on long term investments. I spent most of 2023 learning the ropes of valuing companies and now I'm eager to explore a specific industry.  
  
Lately, I've been drawn to the electric vehicle (EV) sector. While it's tempting to dream of picking the next Tesla, I'm mindful that savvy investors often analyze historical data, seeking common trends that make sense as the sector matures. This includes looking at the miners of essential metals, as well as the hardware and technology necessary for battery production.  
  
To the seasoned investors out there, armed with your current knowledge, what advice would you share with your past selves when initially venturing into this space? Where should one start, and what pitfalls should be avoided?"

2024-01-17 15:10:50,LadsoStocks,What market trends are you BULLISH on for 2024?,"Hey all! Just trying to familiarize myself with some of the most talked about investment opportunities in the market right now as well as potential stock picks for each. Feel free to correct any info here or add on more. Just looking to start a discussion on the different hot topics lately and the following stock picks that go along with them! I know there are several other big opportunities like weed,crypto,etc just didn’t wanna go overboard

**Lithium ( MALRY, LAC)**The booming EV market, along awith the growing demand for renewable energy storage, positions lithium as a key investment opportunity. Major automaker's substantial investments in EVs drive the need for lithium-ion batteries, while the increasing focus on sustainable energy ensures a sustained demand for lithium. Despite global lithium deposits, the challenge of securing a stable and cost-effective supply persists, presenting investment potential in companies involved in lithium exploration, mining, and battery production.

**GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, INTL )**Demand for GPUs comes from AI and machine learning for handling big data in areas like healthcare and finance. Data centers need GPUs for cloud computing as businesses shift operations online. In the gaming industry, GPUs are crucial for high-quality graphics in video games. Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for coins like Ethereum, relies on GPUs for their processing power. Overall, the demand is driven by the growing need for high-performance GPUs in AI, data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency mining.

**Uranium (BHP, NXE )**The demand for uranium primarily stems from its crucial role in fueling nuclear power generation. As global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources intensify, the demand for nuclear energy has been on the rise, particularly in emerging economies like China and India. This growing demand, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical factors affecting uranium production, creates a decent investment opportunity. As countries strive to meet their energy needs while minimizing carbon emissions, uranium stands out as a key component in the clean energy landscape.

Are you betting on any of these? If not what are you looking at?"
2024-01-20 10:39:28,ShotAssistant1452,Where is the love for VUG ?,"Vanguards Large Cap Growth Fund or VUG has had an amazing run over the last 10 years but I often don’t hear much about it when people are suggesting funds.  I understand that most of your money should go into a fund like VTI or an S&P 500 type fund but shouldn’t VUG get more love especially with the powers of large cap stocks these days?

Here is a side by side comparison of VTI and VUG

      VTI                        VUG
1 year 22.28%           42.25%
5 year 13.44%            17.85%
10 year 11.43%.           14%
Expense ratio .03%.     .04%


Another thing to look at is top 10 holdings


VTI.                             VUG
AAPL 6.11%.              13%
Msft 6%.                    12.77%
AMZN 3.04%.           6.46%
Nvda 2.5%.                5.31%
Googl 1.78%.             3.77%
META 1.69%.              3.58%
Goog 1.47%.               3.14%
Tsla 1.44%.                 3.07%
Brk 1.37%
Lly 1.07%.                   2.28%
V.                                   1.82%


Thoughts on why this fund is not talked about as much as QQQ (also great fund) but qqq has a lot higher expense ratio and less diversification 

I’m confused as VUG seems like a fund that is too good to be true and does not get talked about alot"
2024-01-21 11:41:26,OneStrokeAgainstMe,Mutual 'Fun' for my 3yo Son,"So for my son's first birthday (three years ago) I thought it would be fun to invest $1K and see where it would be when he turned 21. I asked all of his relatives to pick any stock or whatever, and then I bought fractional shares to spread out the $1K. I have a record of each initial stock purchase price (people picked everything from stuff that was hot then like NET, SPCE and PLTR to things they thought he'd identify with as he got older like DIS and NKE). Others played it safe and picked mutual funds. Anyway, the 'purity' of the initial $1K is gone because I've added more money (in small amounts) as people have given additional monetary birthday gifts etc. So now I have an imbalanced mishmash. I've been putting the 'new' money in safe places -- specifically VOO, SPY and BRKB. The total is still only about $2K but over the next 18 years I expect to continue to put modest amounts in and I am curious what people think. Should I hammer one mutual fund or spread it around? I have small slices of these stocks:  
  
IMVT, CCL, SPOT, AFRM, ISRG, BABA, WMG, POOL, TWLO, MRNA, AAPL, BA, PBW, SYY, NET, ABNB, TSLA, NKE, ICLN, GM, NIO, PLTR, DIS, HAS, JWN, JMIA, SPCE, VXRT, NOVNQ.  
  
I don't want to dump anything because it will be fun as my son gets older to connect the stock to a relative he will get to know."

2024-01-26 10:22:48,TripleDouble_45,"Long on TSLA equity, waiting for another dip","Thinking of holding a long position on Tesla if the price drops to 150. It's a bit of a gamble, but their new model being released in 2025 will have better profit margins than the sway of declining margins in the EV industry and Musk potentially gaining 25% of voting rights whilst semi autocratic could help them catch up in AI or specifically robotics which seems to be slightly neglected in the AI race and VC funding. The bet on Tesla to be a robotics leader is the biggest gamble however they need to do something to justify their tech valuation because at the moment their primary source of profit stems from automobiles and as opposed to previous predictions they will not have a monopoly over this industry when the EV revolution is realized. If the price drops to 150 (kind of unlikely) I'll probably take a position based on the premise that the valuation is more justified and that there is potential for exponential growth in robotics"

2024-02-05 18:48:29,contrawarp,VTI > VOO (by a small margin) for the upcoming years,"98% will think this is overkill, I get it, but hear me out...

VTI will outperform VOO by about 1-3% per year for the next few years.

Once interest rate cuts begin, the small caps that make up about 15% of VTI will start to perform well versus the stagnation they faced over the last few years due to lower borrowing costs, better risk appetite, etc.

**Returns over the last 1 year: VOO = 20.1% | VTI = 18.3%.**

**Returns over the last 5 years: VOO = 82% | VTI = 75.5%.**

If you have large sums of money to invest, the extra couple of percentage points add up.

As I prefaced, 98% will not care. Either way, DCA and chill. Get IWM if you want to go deep into small caps."

2024-03-18 13:28:46,Complex-Assistant-65,"If you had to choose one stock to hold for the next 30 years, which would it be and why?","The world of investing is filled with short-term strategies and constant market fluctuations, but some investments are made with the long view in mind. Thinking about the long term, especially a period as lengthy as 30 years, requires us to consider not just the current strengths of a company but its potential for sustained growth, innovation, and resilience in the face of economic changes.

If you had to choose just one stock to hold for the next 30 years, which would it be and why? This question isn’t just about picking a winner but understanding the reasons behind such a committed choice. Is it the company’s business model, its role in a growing industry, its adaptability, or perhaps its contribution to significant societal changes?

Share your insights on what makes this stock stand out for you as a decades-long hold. Consider aspects like the company’s potential for growth, its stability, how it might adapt to or lead in technological advancements, and its capacity to navigate the challenges of the future.

Then I look back at another position I started in 1997. Carlisle Companies.  Long term chart shows a split adjusted price of $0.71 in 1997.  Hard to believe.  
It hits home today because Intel has once again disappointed the market and is down 15% at the open.   Carlisle is up $12/share for some reason.  I point this out because, all too often, we concentrate on NVDA, TSLA and DIS, but the real wealth creation is in companies that we hardly know.  
I had screen shots of the charts back to 1996, but they can’t be attached.  Take a look for yourself.

I discussed my method - Trending Value - and that led to me sharing my results with many of you via a program I had written.  Well, that program broke and remained dormant for years... until now.

So what is Trending Value?  It's a method published by James O'Shaughnessey in his ""What Works on Wall Street"" book. During decades of backtesting, it generated over 21% annual returns with equal standard deviation to the total market.  It generated a lot of discussion and lead to [this follow-up thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1eyx3r/how_do_you_select_stocks_contd_trending_value_see/). In my mind, this method resonates the truest... far truer than those who advocate watching the check-out lines at your grocery store to see which products are being purchased. The method, summarizing is the following:

When you run a screen for stocks with good P/E or P/B, what do you look for? You find a stock with a P/E multiple of 12. Is this good? Is this bad? Neither and both, without a frame of reference. O'Shaughnessey's method rates 6 key financial metrics for every stock against the whole market to come up with a cumulative VALUE BASED score. Those metrics are: P/E, P/B, P/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, and Shareholder Yield, which is dividend yield + stock buyback yield (i.e. equity returned to the shareholder in some way).

All 6 metrics are ranked 0-100, where 100 is the ""best"" ratio in the stock universe, and 0 is the worst. The top 10% of stocks will typically have scores in the 420+ range. They are undervalued relative to the rest of the market.

However, just because a stock is undervalued DOES NOT mean that it's a good buy. It could be facing legal action, failing drug trials, having a CEO that just went to jail, or other event that can't be reflected in these numbers. That's where momentum comes into play.

We take the top decile of stocks and reorder them by 6-month price momentum. Invest equally in the top 25, hold for a year, liquidate, repeat. The companies you buy are undervalued and the market is rallying behind them. Back testing, while not a prediction of future results, yielded a 21.2% average ROI with this method.

Of course, there's no screener that does this, nor is there a way to even view ""Shareholder Yield"" in one location.

When I started this 10 years back, [I used MatLab to solve this problem](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46816-oshaughnessey_v5-m).  Yes, MatLab.  Wrong tool for the job.  Thankfully, ChatGPT has turned even amateur hobbyist coders into useful contributors, and a python version has been born.

I'll post the results of today's run below.  Feel free to ask for a specific stock and I'll post the results of that ticker.  Keep in mind, it is filtered to Market Cap > $200M and the name of the method is Trending VALUE - your growth stocks (NVDA, TSLA, etc) are going to be viewed very poorly.

Edit: You'll occasionally see a value like ""10000"" for P/E or another field.  That means the value was either missing or negative.  This is to artificially just kill that field for that ticker."
2024-04-20 21:23:21,Facemole017,What if self driving takes over?,"Hey,

First of all. Do you think is it realistic that self driving takes over and becomes a normal thing?

With the progress of technology we’re really not that far, fsd 12.3.4 is doing really good and we probably full self driving without supervision could be legal in the next 10-20 years.

If it does, we’ll be having an interesting progress of :

- TSLA : will may be in the top 10; actually they’re selling the self driving as a subscription of 99$ monthly, what if every Tesla owner have this feature?

UBER : if Uber replace all drivers by self driving cars. They’ll be saving all payrolls and injecting it to develop other delivery business (could be drones delivery; maybe I went too far but it’s feasible).  There’s a lot of potential and whatever between 45$-55$ is a good buy price.

Thoughts? 💭

In previous posts, I shared more about the ‘why’ behind the investment decisions and reallocation. The previous 1 year update is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) Interestingly, the stock I lamented missing the run up on (Nvidia) is now by biggest holding and one of my best performers.

# Tracking progress

Below are the gains for this portfolio (opened in 2022) as of May 31, 2024. 

# Realized (sold)

All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). 

Peloton was a big loser and the only one I almost immediately regretted, but it was a relatively small investment that was more than offset by others.

I know these are all less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it. 

# Rate of return

The total rate of return since inception (June 2022 to May 2024) is **77.90%**. 

# 3 ways my investing evolved

I’m still well within the ‘maybe I’m just lucky’ phase since it’s only been a couple years, but I’ve noticed I invest differently now than I have in the past: 

1. Insight 
2. Conviction 
3. Patience

**Insight**

I’ve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views). 

Ben Graham’s quote rings true: 

>“In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”

Perhaps counterintuitively, I’ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers. 

Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both. 

# Math

In 2023 I also started practicing math daily (243 days straight as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I’d done any meaningful math. 

I’m not sure how much, but it *feels* like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not. 

**Conviction**

A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term. 

However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths. 

Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I’ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I’m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I’m happy I did. 

A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial. 

This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise, you must seize them.

**Patience**

As a result of my convictions, I’m much more patient in my investing these days and don’t react to the day-to-day. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if I don’t make another trade for the rest of 2024.

**UPDATE:**

A commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:

I opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S&P return is \~28% (\~39% for Nasdaq). My cumulative return for that same period is around \~215%. The annual rate of return (per my Vanguard dashboard) is 77.9% as mentioned in the original post. I would expect my returns to revert to the mean over time."

I only ask this question over here in this sub because I wanna hear the community's thoughts. 

As it stands, Tesla has a total shares outstanding of 3.189 Billion. Something along those lines. 

And if the stock price were to hit 8k per share, the market cap would be around 25 trillion.

2024-06-08 18:57:10,IndubitablePrognosis,Why is there such risk aversion?  98% VOO +2% high-risk outperforms with minimal risk or volatility?  (Genuine question!),"I don't know if it's the bubbles I'm in or what social media feeds me, but it seems like everyone is either a high-stakes crypto/AI gambler, or someone who only advocates dumping everything into a basic market index and leaving it forever.

I haven't used the particular tracker before, but I picked the default date ranges and just picked a couple of high-risk plays for a two percent allocation (Bitcoin and Tesla).  I think there's no denying these were highly volatile and highly-valued.  But even if they went to zero it would have a minimal impact on the portfolio.

But the returns were several percent better than VOO/SPDR.  And a 98% VOO +2% high-risk also outperforms BrkB, while being significantly more diversified.

I think anyone who's trying to ""play it safe"" would be ecstatic to beat the market by 3% by only risking 2% of their allocation.

(I haven't tried it but suspect you could have a portfolio of 70% bonds 30% high-risk and do well with a capped drawdown).

2024-06-17 18:13:47,AfraidScheme433,NVDA after stock split won’t be like TSLA,"
Whether NVDA is overvalued or not is up for debate, I have been hearing on Youtube that NVDA will drop after stock split just like TSLA did.  Let’s look into some figures for comparison:

regarding NVDA, the current market capitalization as of June 2024 is around $3T. This valuation makes NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world by market cap, even higher than the peak valuation of over $1 trillion for TSLA.

In October 2021, TSLA PE ratio was quite high, reflecting its growth expectations and market enthusiasm. The PE ratio was around 250.96 at the end of September 20211, and it likely remained in a similar range throughout October. The forward PE ratio, which is based on projected earnings, was also elevated, indicative of the optimism about the company's future performance.

As for NVIDIA, as of today, the current PE ratio is approximately 77.182. The forward PE ratio, which considers expected future earnings, is around 46.823 (TSLA at its peak:67.57). These values suggest that investors are expecting strong growth from NVIDIA as well."
2024-06-18 11:23:48,National-Ad8416,Getting on the AI bandwagon,"Hello Everyone, I am already invested in the SP500 through Vanguard (of which AI giants like Nvidia and Google form a major part).

Alternately, I am also thinking about buying more affordable but promising AI companies (I wouldn't know which) using the philosophy that a rising tide lifts all boats. Or maybe an AI-based sector ETF?

I have never invested in individual stocks before (other than what was granted to me through RSUs) and am not even sure if a play like this makes sense.

Is what I am contemplating prudent? Any feedback (critical or otherwise) is welcome.

2024-06-25 17:50:54,Agreeable-Fix993,I always hear “younger people can be more risky”. What does that mean?,"For context I am 24 and recently got my first career job and my plan is to invest 18% of my income into Roth 401k (vested immediately) and Roth IRA (making sure I max out Roth IRA first) plus the employer 1:1 match up 4%. This should get me about 12000ish a year in contributions that will solely be S&P 500 mutual funds only as I’ve always heard that it is hard for anyone to outcompete the S&P 500 long term. 

My only thing is that every financial person such as The Money Guy say that at younger age you can be a little more risky but I don’t quite understand what that means? What index would have a higher risk/reward or are they talking about getting individual stocks? If I did do something more risky I’d only feel comfortable with a max of 10% in risk stuff so if someone could explain what is considered more risky I might just be able to make a more educated decision and decide if it is right for me and open a brokerage account for this purpose only.

2024-06-26 15:44:53,XShadowSlayerX3,Safe starting plan to get into Futures? As well as what to do with my ROTH? ,"Hello all, I am very confused on how to proceed from the position I am in, and so would really really appreciate some advice. I am 19 years old.

Firstly, for some background, I started trading maybe back in 2022, I put in about $2500 in a WeBull trading account and invested in a bunch of big names like AAPL, TSLA, LMT, etc. And I invested some money into some complete no name stocks that I saw on TikTok. By what I would imagine to be completely luck, these stocks actually did quite well and they have been in the green for some time now. But yes, I know not to take advice from TikTok lol.

Fast forward to now, I havent touched the account since then, and opening it I have made a return of about 16% with about $400 in total open P&L. Which I feel like is good? maybe? I don't know.

Anyways the reason I'm making this post is because I'm interested in short term profits, I have always wanted to get into options but to be honest it just seemed very tricky and like gambling, and so it's always been a ""I'll learn how to get into it later"", but a few days ago I heard about something called futures trading and it seems much more simple and I would like to get into it. I have a very superficial understanding of how it works, and so I was just hoping to ask a couple questions about it:

1. Should I trade futures through a prop firm? Especially if I am just starting out/don't have a trading strategy? Or would I be better off starting with micros & my own money?
2. On that note, how do I go about developing a trade strategy? Do I just watch a YT video on different strategies available and pick one? My friend told me all strategies will work if I just use discretion but tbh that just made me more confused lol
3. What should I use to trade futures? I have heard that Ninjatrader is good.

And the next topic comes to my Roth IRA through Fidelity. over the course of a few months back in 2022 I put $200 in it monthly and eventually stopped, mainly because I was confused what ETFs I should put my money in.

People have told me VOO > SPY, but then some others said $FXAIX > $VOO. Which, if any, is true? Should I invest in all 3? Also, is $200 a month enough? Should I aim to max for $6500 contributed annually? Does it really matter?

I realize this post is all over the place and I apologize, but it's all the more reason I would appreciate some answers and so that I know where to go moving forward. Thank you very much!!!!"

I only had to pay half of my college so that was really helpful but I’ve been working a lot of jobs and internships since 16 which helped too.

So I started investing 7 years ago and have seen an annualized return of 16.1%. I bought Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and others in the first couple years and have seen incredible returns from them. 

My question is if you would recommend I diversify any of my gains. For example I put 1k into Nvidia and now it’s around 10k. But now my stock portfolio is not that diversified because of some large gains between a few stocks I have are holding all the weight. Is there a threshold in the gain % where you start taking out and diversifying? For example, if I make 500% return on a given stock, anything over I would invest in something else. 

Just want to hear your thoughts because I’m still young and haven’t been around too long in the market. I want to use this money for retirement and I’m a pretty stable investor (I invest for the long run, no day trading). Thank you"

For believers in AI and Robotics, which will likely dominate the next 5-10 years. MSFT for less volatility.

In the past ten years, TSLA and NVDA added heaps of value due to once-in-a-generation type shifts in the global economy (Electrification, The rise of ChatGPT-like apps). One more is due in the next ten years - humaniod-ish robots being as common as family cars.

""You know, we think diversification is—as practiced generally—makes very little sense for anyone that knows what they’re doing...it is a protection against ignorance."" Warren Buffet, 1996 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting

It's somewhat counter-Bogleheads and old advice, but nevertheless, an opposing view is useful. Years later, the virtues of a S&P 500 fund were extolled when compared to expert stock picking in Berkshire Hathaway's 2017 shareholder letter.

2024-07-12 22:44:33,tionstempta,What is biggest risks to Yield Max ETF?,"I trade actively (futures/options) and have different accounts for different reasons (i.e: long term/IRA/401K/day trading/swing trading/YOLO account as well) so my financial literature is relatively well, but I still dont see the biggest risks to yield max ETF, which is selling covered calls and selling cash secured puts on many famous stocks such as TSLA/NVDA

Those have good return, so I have been buying IRA, since taxes wont apply until withdrawal in retirement. 

  
I understand how they will pay out the dividend in theory and actually I use similar strategy in SPY but whats the biggest risk here? 

My best guess is that individual stocks goes to 0, by which Yield Max ETF will go into 0, but it's hard to imagine that NVDA will go to 0 in any time soon, since they are dealing with big tech or big name stocks with good financial statement and pretty much too big to fail business (i.e: DIS/JPM) 

That makes me think there is virtually no risks but apparently, it sounds too good to be true, and I am getting cautious. Are there anything I should know on this kind of ETFs? 

Thank you

2024-08-01 11:11:55,21_Points,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

What do you guys think?"
2024-08-06 13:03:48,NoItsNotMeToday,3 Fund Portfolio / Bond Advice,"I'm 44 years old and have about $5M in my Schwab accounts. Around $1M is in SNAXX money market, taking advantage of the high interest rates, and the rest is in stocks and mutual funds. My largest holdings are in AAPL and TSLA, accounting for about $3M.

I spoke with my adviser at Schwab today because I'm ready to redirect my monthly SIMPLE IRA contributions (\~$2666/month for my wife and me) from buying stocks to something else. He suggested the Schwab Intelligent Portfolio, which seems like a good fit. I've also been reading about the 3-fund portfolio.

So, with all that in mind, I have a few questions:

1. **Feedback on SIP vs. 3-fund portfolio?** If I go with the 3-fund portfolio, should I stick with the Schwab options listed on the Bogleheads wiki, or is there a better way to choose the funds?
2. **Advice on moving $500K from SNAXX to bonds:** I'm ready to move half of the $1M in SNAXX to bonds in preparation for interest rates coming down, so I can lock in some good returns for the next 5 years. Any recommendations on what I should consider buying?

I've done well so far by just buying stocks, but this is a bit out of my expertise, so I would love some guidance. Thanks!"

How can I take advantage of the loss?,"I’m finally realizing my TSLA stock, which I once thought would go through the roof, will not reach my estimated potential. I will sell them before year end along with another dog stock I have held for too long for a combined loss of $40K. 

Most discussions of tax loss or capital gains harvesting would be concerned with what I do with the cash from that sale, but I have a different question. I have NVDA shares which have appreciated $40K, and I have held them for more than a year. Does it make sense to take my profit now in order to have a net-zero transaction? Is this a mechanism for taking my profit in NVDA without owing additional taxes as if I sold it in retirement?"

2024-08-20 17:21:19,cfeltus23,Should I be riskier in my Roth or my normal brokerage?,"I have been researching Roth IRAs as I turn 18  in a few months. I’ve seen conflicting information on investment strategies for your Roth. 

I had originally thought to use the Roth for “safer” holds like VOO and QQQ but have been seeing some people say to put risk in a Roth and safe in a normal brokerage. I just want to see what you guys do so I can give myself some context to make my own decision.

I already have a normal brokerage that holdd VOO, QQQ, UPRO, NEE, DVN, TSLA, and BITU

I also am very heavy in crypto (85% BTC and 5% ETH), so I am definitely holding a fairly aggressive portfolio for some context. I was thinking holding mostly etfs in my Roth and individual stocks in my brokerage. Let me know what you think of that approach and what yours is"
2024-08-21 14:23:57,NoItsNotMeToday,Next Steps with Rebalance and Growth,"I posted a couple weeks ago seeking some advice on a 3 fund portfolio and bonds [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1elrna2/3_fund_portfolio_bond_advice/).  Got lots of great feedback, and now that I have digested it all - I'm looking to move on some of it and hoping for some followup great advice on how to best handle.  The gist of it was:

  
*$5M portfolio, heavily weighted in AAPL and TSLA (80%) with $1M cash. Commenters suggest diversifying into index funds or bond funds, considering the tax implications of selling stocks, and caution against over-reliance on Schwab Intelligent Portfolios due to its high cash allocation. Some recommend exploring municipal bonds for tax efficiency and using a more conservative investment strategy given my financial situation.*

What I've started the process of doing is moving some of the cash to VOO, VXUS and VXF at a 50/25/25 split.  I feel confident with that mix and my goal of turning this $5M into $10M in \~10 years seems possible.  That just leaves the stocks and figuring out how to best convert those over into the 3 funds.  Am I right in assuming that there is really no real trick to this other than to sale them at the rate of taxes I'm willing to incur each year?  Much of the AAPL and TSLA holdings are profit so they are gonna hit me the hardest.  If I'm right in that assumption - what not just pull the bandaid off and do them all now?  Is there any real benefit to doing them over several years?  I don't plan on selling everything, but do want to move the bulk of stuff to those 3 funds."

50% voo - the other 50% split evenly between

Is it a good idea to keep dca this way for the next 15 years ?

Been having trouble looking for more positions in my portfolio

Top contenders currently are UBER, ABNB, and PLTR though its hard to justify their survivability and future growth

My criteria is as follows:

* U.S. companies only
* Sectors: Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Cyclical
* Survivability in its competing industry
* Specialized niche focus, not portfolio companies with a bunch of products/services
* Disruptive/innovative moats with compelling future pipeline
* High revenue per employee
* Top tier talent working at the company
* No company that helps other companies departments (think HR, Finance, Sales & Marketing)
   * Cybersecurity and Cloud management are OK

Some bullet points listed above do counter a few of my current holdings, though for new positions I am more strict

Any information is much appreciated!"
2024-10-15 10:01:21,alf_london,"""frontier tech"" portfolio ","hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:

* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.
* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.
* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.
* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.
* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.
* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.

ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:

**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN

* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:
* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here.
* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).
* 15% mix of these...
   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation
   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large
   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership
   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership
   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership
   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now
* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.
* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.

**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR

* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play.
* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.
* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.

**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR

* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:
* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.
* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.
* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.

**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.

ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.

2024-10-24 04:05:33,BurgerFoundation,Ideas for a upcoming market downturn,"Just collecting thoughts on a potential market down turn for a 6 month rotation.  I have been seeing and hearing about the Warren buffet indicator (debt ratio to GDP) and it’s not looking good.  Maybe it’s something maybe it’s nothing.  We also are not sure if we have a soft landing yet as well.  

I have a few thoughts feel free to add in.  If you have done something similar leave the idea

1.  Move my 401k and Roth into a money market and collect ~4%.  I am not moving the whole thing possibly 25-50%.  I have fidelity and Blackrock so SPAXX and I’m limited in my 401k to blackrock money market that’s available.

2.  Move 50%.  25% to money markets 25% to SQQQ.

My investments are pretty basic.  I have blackrock my2055 retirement fund.  

Roth is 60% Spy 
20% Qqq 
10% TSLA
10% PLTR

Not sure If there is a benefit ,"I just hit 100k in my portfolio with 52% in SP500 (all VOO) and now interested in switching to go heavier in dividend stocks. My portfolios other holdings are “safe” TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL…The two dividend stocks I’m holding are monthly paid dividend all reinvested, (SCM, GLAD) earning me $20 and change a month each and have not lost capital. For some reason my mind is telling me to open a new brokerage account dedicated to only dividend and let my 100k sit dormant, is there any upside to this or is the same as putting money in my current account just reallocate the automatic funds from going to VOO into the dividend stocks.

2024-11-03 07:20:44,SevenDeMagnus,The Contradiction of Warren Buffet's Avoidance of $TSLA,"Hi investing friends, helping fellow like-minded people (where's the trading/day trading swing tradaing sub-reddit of r/investing by the way?) add their fundamentals. I'm 93/7 percent believe in Warren and Elon, meaning if they say 100 things, I will most like believe 93 or them 110%:

Although Warren Buffett and we must always do our best to surpass our heroes like all Olympic records are meant to be broken (coz' in part technology, rule change and medicine advances) or NBA stars like MJ surpassing their heroes and Warren Buffett is still the genius compared to 93.% of investors and traders (the remaining 7% are the other stars like Peter Lynch), he's also made a few mistakes (Amazon is the best example coz' he always insists he doesn't understand technology which is honestly not that hard to understand but may be hard to see the road ahead when the internet was democratized including made affordable for the common working man with a decent salary ala Henry Ford's speech):

granted he loves CEOs and founders who have a laid back personality that are orthodox but orthodox in the big way, like Tim Cook, and granted TSLA is overbought by saying TSLA has the market cap of the auto industry combined vs. it's book value (math part of things, ruled by figures/number so it's more a part of technical analysis still), is he avoiding TSLA because:

a)  Elon Musk's personality is the biggest Think Big of all Think Bigs in the industrial history (way bigger than Henry Ford or Vanderbilt and the others who built industrial america which spilled to the world) and he's not comfortable with that

b) or is it because it's personal coz' they had a little war on words in the interviews and on X/formerly Twitter?

If it's about a) then it contradicts with his being on the Left mindset (a democrat, I'm with team common sense by the way at the moment coz' it has clarity, consistency and specific solutions) coz' the Left is very unorthodoxed and sometimes even comically non-sensical, going way beyond common sense.

If it's b) that's even worse, coz' one's judgment must not be clouded as Graham and Warren have though themselves, big decisions must be logical not ruled by vibes and emotions.

Thank you.

God bless fundamental and technical analysis analyzers"

2024-11-06 10:45:54,Classic-Asparagus,What are your expectations for green/renewable energy stocks under a Trump presidency?,"I bought some FAN (wind) and TAN (solar) back in 2021, hopeful that energy stocks would do well because of growing environmental concerns and attempts to shift away from reliance on fossil fuels. Unfortunately, they’ve not been doing well at all. FAN has dropped over 20% since I bought it, and TAN has dropped over 50%. They’re pretty much the only stocks I own that have given me a long term loss 

Woke up today to a Trump victory and both stocks dropping by over 5% despite the rest of the market rallying. I know in part that might be due to people selling yesterday in anticipation of a possible Trump victory (I know I was thinking of selling yesterday, but the market closed before I made a decision), but I’m curious what people think about the more long term performance of green energy stocks?

I’ve been thinking of selling for a while, but so far I’ve convinced myself that the stocks are probably going down now because of high initial production prices, but that they’ll probably go up again in the future. However, I’m skeptical of them doing well under a Trump presidency, at least compared to a Harris presidency, considering how little priority Trump gives to environmental causes and renewable energy. Also the fact that a lot of solar panels come from China with high tariffs

2024-11-08 11:51:56,packmad,"Creating a Python library for Mandelbrot's metrics, doubts with Hurst Exponent/Scale","Sorry if I am off-topic, I am new to this world and to get feedback I had to start somewhere (send me to the proper subreddit if I'm wrong).

I have just finished reading The Misbehaviour of Markets by Mandelbrot, and I immediately started looking for libraries in Python to do data analysis using his suggested metrics.

To my surprise, I couldn't find any. So, first question, did I not search properly? What do you use?

Therefore, I started developing mine :)  
But I am having problems with the Hurst exponent/scalability (it is utilized to evaluate the extent of long-term reliance in market predictability), I don't understand how to interpret the results or there is a bug in the code (less likely, or in the data).

2024-11-12 08:25:25,stertercsi,For TSLA is next options move ,"Last Friday's surge was clearly the result of an options Gamma Squeeze, in which a large number of people purchased call options, forcing the options market maker to buy shares, pushing the stock price further up, and then more people bought call options, and the options market maker was forced to buy more shares, and the process repeats itself!

Gamma Squeeze can make the stock price surge quickly in a short period of time, but this kind of increase is often unsustainable, because options market makers to buy a large number of shares, due to the stock price in a very high position, holding the risk is quite large, the options market makers will be the IV of the call options continue to raise, so that the operation of buying the call options become less lucrative

At this time, once someone sells a call option, the options market maker will sell shares to hedge, the stock price in a short period of time, the biggest buying momentum will disappear, the compression effect is lost, the stock price will turn down, a large number of profitable call options will also be closed, which in turn will lead to options market maker to sell more positive shares

For the next half month, we may try to move up and down first this week, but then I think TSLA is about to have a pullback close to 15%~20% or so.

Of course, these ups and downs due to the Gamma Squeeze won't change a company's long-term fundamentals, and with a share price below $300 TSLA is certainly a position to add to"
2024-11-12 11:59:37,Came2Play,Is This What One Would Consider Destiny?,"Consider this: Elon's big bet on republicans has, in many ways, paid off and will continue to pay off.

Under them, many of Elon's ventures will see immense growth, benefiting from the regulatory environment that will be favorable to his business model.

But what if there was another way to capture those returns without investing in $TSLA or relying solely on the fortunes of Elon's publicly traded companies?

Let me introduce you to Destiny Tech 100 - a publicly listed fund that is making private market investments accessible to everyday people - targeting high-growth pre-IPO companies like and most importantly SpaceX and OpenAl that are traditionally off-limits to us normies → SpaceX and OpenAl constitute to almost two-fifths of the fund's holdings!

With how $TSLA has faired so far, I can see how this SpaceX proxy could perform. Curious to hear your thoughts!

PS: Wish I could post the ticker here but im afraid it is clipping the market cap threshold barely based on intraday moves. However im confident in your ability to find it out yourself on the web."
2024-11-13 15:29:46,TheJumperbumper,Portfolio thoughts + stock picks ,"Portfolio + questions

Hey everyone! What are your thoughts on top stock picks for 2025? And could you let me know thoughts on my portfolio? Thanks!

Thoughts on the AI, cloud infrastructure, energy (Nuclear, solar, wind, Oil, Gas, etc.), and mining (Copper, Uranium, etc,) sectors? 

I’m having trouble finding actual stable mining and energy stocks which actually are stable or going up. The majority I find are declining, whether it be moderate or sharp.
