2,2020-07-28 06:24:45,ready-set-trade,TRADE OF THE DAY: NVIDIA ($NVDA) Vertical Spread 415/417.5 CALL 28AUG [07/28/20],"*Begun, The Dollarpocalypse Has . . .* &#x200B; — **Pre-Market Summary** — Two headlines grabbed my attention yesterday: # [Gold price hits record high on new fears for the economy]( # [Dollar index slides to 2-year low]( I can't help but suspect this is a zeitgeist moment; will these serve as a weathervane for what's to come? S&P futures and European stocks slumped as market optimism faded during the busiest week of earnings season while Gold was hammered moments after the December future hit an all time high of $2000 following a record-breaking rally, with spot gold tanking more than $30 in minutes and silver dropping as much as 2% before regaining composure. Gold hit a record high on Tuesday before the sheer scale of its gains drew a burst of profit-taking, with the volatility prompting the Shanghai Gold Exchange to issue a notice on risk prevention and express a willingness to take action if required. The dump in gold also helped the dollar rebound from two-year lows. After rising almost $40 higher at one point to reach $1,980 an ounce, gold was hit by a wave of selling which it pushed back to $1,915 in volatile trade. Gold is still up over $125 in little more than a week as investors bet the Federal Reserve will reaffirm its accommodating policies at its meeting this week, and perhaps signal a tolerance for higher inflation in the long run. ""Fed officials have made clear that they will be making their forward guidance more dovish and outcome-based soon,"" wrote analysts at TD Securities. “The chairman is likely to continue the process of prepping markets for changes when he speaks at his press conference.” One shift could be to average inflation targeting, which would see the Fed aim to push inflation above its 2% target to make up for years of under-shooting. &#x200B; — **Top Overnight News** — * Senate Republicans presented their $1 trillion plan to bolster the pandemic-ravaged U.S. economy with a package that that didn’t completely settle differences within the GOP * Gold’s record-breaking rally showed signs of losing steam after futures touched $2,000 an ounce for the first time * The European Central Bank urges banks to hold off on returning capital to shareholders and show moderation in setting bonuses amid the coronavirus outbreak in a blow to some lender * China’s “bat woman” says the U.S. president owes her country an apology as she again denied assertions that the novel coronavirus is linked to the Wuhan lab where she works * Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez lashes out in response to the U.K. ratcheting up its travel ban to Spain to include popular holiday islands &#x200B; — **Trade Of The Day** — The game of musical chairs continues with large-cap tech stocks; eventually the music will stop playing and no seats will be found before prices drop, but until that event occurs, most of the market gains are coming from this sector. Today's Trade of the Day comes via NVDA who does not report earnings until August 13th. [It's set up in a flag formation with a lot of potential energy, ready to break]( And as we've seen lately, stocks are breaking BEFORE their earnings date. Here are two potential plays: 1. What makes trading NVDA a challenge, like every other big-cap tech stock, is the price of $415/share. If you don't define a stop loss, then buying just ONE share at $415 represents the maximum 2% account risk for a $21k account! This is where fractional shares can come to the rescue for small accounts. I can define a fixed dollar amount in RH (or other brokers supporting fractional shares) and they will create a fractional share position equivalent to my investment. For example, if I wanted to create a [$40 NVDA position, then RH would grant me .096 shares of NVDA]( 2. Alternatively, I could still leverage the gains/losses of a [100-share NVDA position]( by trading a **vertical options spread using the 28AUG option series**, going **long the $415 call** and simultaneously **selling the $417.5 call** as ""insurance."" This trade *allows me to cap my risk at $125/contract*, which would represent a max 2% risk to a $6250 account.

5,2021-02-23 18:09:14,HCDuschang,NVDA Q3 Review (Earnings Feb. 24),"A short guide to Q3 with Q4 Earnings on Feb. 24 after market close if anyone is looking to play NVDA Earnings: NVDA had a very profitable Q3 with revenue up 22% from $3.8 billion to $4.7 billion. Their operating expenses were down 4% from $1.6 billion to $1.5 billion. Seeing as though they did not have successful net income in the second quarter, they were up 115%. This can be attributable to the release of the GeForce RTX 3090, the latest graphics processing unit (GPU) for gamers and crypto miners. Consistently sold out in stores, Nvidia's new product helped their net income, rising to $1.3 billion in the quarter. &#x200B; Cash and cash equivalents from the beginning of the year to October have decreased slightly by $7 million. Otherwise, current assets have increased about $1 billion from January 26, 2020 to the Q3 Report. Total assets gained about $10 billion as we see Nvidia investing more into Goodwill from $600 million to $4 billion. Intangible assets shot up through $2 billion from $49 million. We can theorize this as research and development, helping Nvidia maintain an edge over other processor companies. On the liability side, Nvidia has increased total liabilities from $1.7 billion to $2.6 billion. We mainly see this increase due to an increase in long-term debt of $5.9 billion from $1.9 billion. There is some minimal short-term debt, but hopefully will be decreased or erased after Q4 Earnings Report. **Data Related Revenue:** Third quarter revenue increased 8% to $1.9 billion from $1.748 billion. Lots of new products including [NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD Solution for Enterprise]( and [NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU]( Nvidia announced partnerships with VMWare, Amazon Web Services, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Data has been a main focus for Nvidia and as they continue to release new products, we expect to see their revenue grow and technological developments multiply with faster, more efficient technology. **Gaming Related Revenue:** Revenue was up to $2.27 billion with a 37% increase for the quarter. GeForce RTX GPUs were at the forefront of the gaming revenue, offering up to 2x the performance of first generation RTX. Ray tracing was also big in the quarter with video games including Fornite, Cyberpunk 2077, Call of Duty Black Ops, and Watch Dogs: Legion all supporting these elevated graphics. **Professional Visualization Revenue:** Relating to 3D graphics and video game design, revenue was up 16 percent to $236 million. **Automotive Revenue:** Revenue was $125 million and we expect Automotive Revenue to increase rapidly as more companies look to implement AI into their vehicles. Partnering with Mercedes, Hyundai, and Li Auto, Nvidia is working to provide AI products to these companies. NIO is also partnering to produce automated cars with Nvidia by 2022. &#x200B; Relating to revenue by market NVDA is involved in. We see major growth in Data Center revenue, similar to our financial analysis. Gaming is still the major source of revenue. We hope to see an increase in Auto revenue as NVDA has partnered with multiple automakers to develop AI driving. **Q4 Outlook:** As stated in their Q3 Earnings Report, they expect to generate about $4.8 billion in revenue. Operating expenses will slightly increase similar to Q2 results around $1.64 billion. **Personal Opinion:** We expect Gaming Revenue to continue to be the majority source but believe Automotive Revenue will increase as development in AI technology continues rising. Nvidia is a strong company in the semiconductor market and is looking to fortify their control with acquisitions including Arm Limited from SoftBank. Nvidia has missed expectations on the past 6 Earnings Reports. We estimate that analysts are bullish on the earnings and NVDA will continue missing on their earnings. This is a long term hold as Nvidia has already proved themselves as a semiconductor company, they now have to maintain an edge against the competition. Their GPU development is required for consistent revenue and we expect involving themselves in crypto mining with the announcement of the NVIDIA CMP HX will be successful.",6.199564324564326

8,2021-09-26 19:17:05,CJT2013,Part 4: After 4 Years Day Trading; 2 Years Full Time. Here's Some More Advice,"Every 180 days I make another post to [thread it back to the original]( before it's archived. I do this to prevent a bunch of small posts every few days about trivial subjects. [Part 1]( (Same link as 'thread it back to the original.) [Part 2]( [Part 3]( **This is Part 4,** and I'll go over life outside of trading. The previous 3 talked mostly about trading and the outline of my style is written in them. If you're just scrolling and want to know what it managing money when you're income is completely trading. Then so be it. Mind you this is my experience as a single, male, mid-20's, no debt (anymore), minimalist, full-time trader living in Texas. **TL;DR** \- Full time trading has its pros and cons. The pros are obvious. The cons are what people don't talk about. The true cost of doing this as your source of income has the propensity to invite an extraordinary amount of stress. Trading is easy (very easy), it's the lifestyle that's not for the faint of heart because bills add up... And trading isn't gambling because statistics and risk management. Here's what I'll go over in this post: 1. **The real cost of being full time** \- *The main one I want to tackle because like I've said in the past, ""Risk management as a trader is 24/7."" I touched up on this in Part 1 but I really want to break every single expense down and compare it to profits. Think about cost of living and what you're really giving up for this career such as health benefits, matching 401k, easy work, a consistent paycheck, and \*job security\*. This one will also answer the, ""****How much do I need to do this business full time?****"" Question.* ***It depends on your expenses.*** 2. **Psychology** \- *Briefly. It's a simple subject/debate. Quick paragraph because that's really all there is to ""Psychology of trading""* I thought about writing this in a, **""Letter to myself 2 years ago""** to potentially allow readers to read it vicariously like a letter to yourself written from yourself 2 years in the future but perhaps another time as a random post down the line. There was consideration doing an **AMA** but [read The Wiki]( if you want my patterns. *(I'm a mod here, I wouldn't mod a subreddit that suggests bad material. Everything to start you out is there. It's fantastic info)*. There's also a few videos on my Twitter from last year. **Before I begin:** Trading unfortunately has the propensity to attract gamblers. The entry barrier is so low you could start trading against the pros off a few apps on your phone. Allow that to digest before putting any risk out there. Yes, most lose. But redo that statistic with ONLY people that have a proven business plan backed by statistics then redact those who didn't follow the plan. If you have that with clear cut granular rules.. Fear is the only thing that will stop you from making this a healthy and respectable source of income. I would bet that the success rate would go north of 80%. ***So we begin:*** 1) The Real Cost of Trading Full Time: **A)** I assume you know exactly what your expenses are *but for the sake of granularity.. let's tackle the meat of everyday people:* * **Mortgage (PITI) / Rent** * **Taxes on your house Home/Renters Insurance** * **Health Insurance -** * **Car Note (P&I only)** * **Car Insurance** * **Car Preventative Maintenance (Oil, Transmission Fluid, Servicing, Registration/Inspection)** * **Gas** * **Utilities** * **Wifi** * **CellPhone Bill** * **Groceries** * **And don't dare forget about your retirement or kid's 529 savings plan. Just because you trade stocks doesn't mean you don't need to invest. I do it. And yes it feels weird shorting NVDA for a day trade when that's my heaviest allocation since 2018.** * (We'll get to the biggest bamboozlement of them all in a while...Income taxes) Now add some ancillary things in there like: Gym membership, haircut, night out with S/O, gifts for family and friends birthdays, Christmas/Hanukah gifts, and other services but we'll just calculate the necessities then play around with the numbers a bit: For visuals: [ &#x200B; These are absolute necessities not including ancillary expenses for homeowners. Of course if you're renting by yourself, with friends, or living at home, adjust for yourself. This isn't including the income taxes you'll pay at the end of the year. **So the grand total monthly expenses based on averages I found on Google based off of NerdWallet... $5,253. (Google it if you want. The article is from April 29th, 2021). Some consider savings and retirement to not be expenses but I'm not writing this to grasp at straws over trivial debates. This argument is, ""There's money that cannot be spent.. it's an expense to yourself"".** I'll take that number from above and round it to $5,000. That's way above mine given have the Texas Blue Title to my truck *(Chevy Runs Deep)*, rent my home, don't have health insurance.. [Got some controversial replies on that one]( but hey, that's my risk. God Blessed me and I don't take it for granted. So I'll tell you my monthly expenses although I feel its a little intrusive but I'm sure nobody I personally know reads my posts anyways. Just under $4,000/mo are my expenses for my necessities. Mind you... Single, Texas, Male, Minimalist, I loathe spending money, and I can have fun seeing if I can do more pushups than I did yesterday and throwing the baseball with my neighbor at the fields. Let's compare on a monthly basis. (When I say life of a trader isn't luxurious rather it is, ""Comfortable"", I mean it whole-heartedly.) **AVG Monthly Expenses (USA)** [ **AVG Monthly Expenses (Me)** [ Average American Monthly Expenses. Of course this all varies from state to state. This could potentially be biased since I'm from Texas but it seemed decent to me. \*\*\*\*GRAND TOTAL:\*\*\*\* $5,085. Now we're starting to see the cutbacks I made to make a living from trading myself... No health insurance, I don't drive anything crazy, no matching in my retirement plan from my 9-5, I barely drive anywhere, cheap liability (don't give me a ticket) car insurance. \*\*\*\*GRAND TOTAL:\*\*\*\* $3,550 of necessities. Here's the psychology of all those numbers from above... I assume you know [what an R is]( So let's take the $5,000 number from earlier. Your monthly expenses that is. And we're talking theoretical backtesting. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*NOT INCLUDING SLIPPAGE OR COMMISSIONS.\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 1. **At $500 risk.** You would need to make 10R per month **(EASY)** *(0.38R/day Avg. OR 1.9R/week)* 2. **At $400 risk.** You would need to make 12.5R per month **(EASY)** *(0.59R/day Avg. OR 2.97R/week)* 3. **At $250 risk.** You would need to make 20R per month **(Doable. Not guaranteed)** *(0.95R/day Avg. OR 4.76R/week)* 4. **At $100 risk.** You would need to make 50R per month **(Not happening)** This is the risk amount I did when I resigned from my 9-5. Mind you I did personal training on the side. **I can make 10R in a month easily. It's happened in a day before**. [But can you also handle potentially losing $500? Or being up 1.8R then having the trade come back and stopping you out?]( I can with $500 risk. Could I do that in 2019? **Absolutely not**. I'd have a blood pressure so high due to materializing my trades with what COULD happen and what bills that COULD have been paid as soon as the trade filled. Now in 2021? I do it almost everyday when my edge is shown but that's with years of statistics backing me. Have a look at my spreadsheet stats. I've had the same EV, Sharpe Ratio, Win Rate, key metrics, etc. for years. <spreadsheet stats>: [ This is what helps my ""Psychology"" and ""Headspace"" going into trades. This isn't something that can just be handed to you. It's years (months for some) of filling everything out then slicing and dicing data to make it work. ""It"" being your style of trading. It may not be the most profitable but it's something that you can manage mentally. It's years of, ""Why did I take that trade? What was I thinking? I don't want to even fill it out. I won't do it again."" Fill out every trade and things will distill down into a strategy that's YOURS. I've built these over the years and they tell me the biggest run ups and drawdowns in a theoretical trading account. I know there will be months I make 5R after slippage and some months I make 35R... There will be days I'm up $2,750 in 5 minutes and other days I'm down $1,750 in less than 10 minutes... **There are ALSO DAYS that turn into WEEKS that I don't even touch an order ticket to put on a trade because you don't make money putting on trades. You make money in this business by putting large sums of calculated risk on high EV trades.** **Equity Curve Simulator I built:** [ &#x200B; Visualize your data. It helps make things seem more real resulting in you honoring your business plan. If you're a man of your word, prove it by following your rules from your mouth. I've gone over how to handle losses before. It's simple, it's an expense just like Mark Douglas says. **Let's drop the pessimistic scarcity mindset and forget how you handle losses. How do you handle profits?** Are you responsible with them? There's this thing called, **""Reversion to the mean"".** And we can utter the words, ""Oh yeah I know there will be losses and good weeks"" But do you sulk over 2 measly trades that ALMOST hit target but stopped you out? Do these 2 or 5 or 10 trades change how you trade forever? It shouldn't but I see it on here all the time people pouting over such a small sample size of trades looking for advice. You do realize there will be times you get smacked around then the market goes quiet for a few weeks leaving you making zero deals for a while from time to time. Do you really care about those 2R or 5R or is it the money that was attached to it? That's the loss side of things. The profiting side of things is different. People start to get cocky. I make more R than my theoretical testing occasionally because of missing trades (rarely). Does that mean I'm better than my backtesting? (You'll never beat your backtesting. It's impossible UNLESS you just so happen ""miss"" every losing trade your backtesting would have picked up). With your extra profits/good weeks do you increase risk and or buy things you don't need? *""I made $2,750 this week. I'll cover your golf game/buy your lunch"" <--Don't be this guy. (Not speaking from experience either srs)* •There will be weeks you make 13R •There will be weeks you lose 5R •There will be weeks you reach your limit down R •There will be times after you hit your limit down that there are no deals/trades to be made for WEEKS. Plural. Not just 1 week. Sometimes 2 and rarely 3 weeks. Almost an entire month of no trades. •There will be times where it seems like the market is handing you free money left and right to where you start to feel bad for people on the other side of your trades. Trading isn't a rose garden of free money, it will feel like that from time to time. It will also feel like an absolute money pit. But Central Limit Theorem / The Law of Large Numbers does its magic: Actual vs Theory Performance & Growth- [ People have the propensity to look at their performance through a microscope rather than taking a step back to look at the big picture. That's why it amazes me how people use such a small sample size of data (20 - 100 trades) then put large sums of risk on it. Only to pout about later INEVITABLE results. They complain over 2 trades. You will have tough weeks. Businesses do go through hard times and times of euphoria. Think of how people who rent beach houses in the winter vs summer. The above picture is looking at the big picture. So let's zoom in to the first 5 months: [ &#x200B; How are you reacting when, ""The market is beating my performance. I'd have done better if I just put my money in the market or sold CC's. I'm only up $19,000 in 5 months when I should be up more than $30,000. I broke rules. I took more risk than I should have. I'll stop while I'm ahead"". How do you react in the other 23 hours in the day after trades result in losses day after day? This is the magic/beauty of Central Limit Theorem / The Law of Large Numbers: [ [ I always say only 2 things can happen in a trade (hence its so EASY). Profit or loss. Heads or tails. This image is of 10 trials with 2 results. Think of the 10 trials like the 10 different times you start trading you strategy live. You might start with a hot streak or a streak of donations to Wall Street. Think of the 2 results as profit or loss. IN THE END. It all averages out, don't be pathetic and pout over 2 or 10 trades resulting in a less than desirable sum **So how do YOU decide how much you want to risk? Is it...** 1. How much you want to make in a month divided by an R per month goal? NO.. The market doesn't know you. You can't force R's to happen. They come to you. There are entire 5 trading day weeks that I don't touch an order ticket. It's not everyday you make a deal. 2. How much you think you can mentally handle? Not the best idea but it's a better idea. 3. A cocktail of metrics such as how much buying power you have, Risk of Ruin, EV, and Sharpe Ratio. *(Notice how I don't care for Win-Rate? Win-Rate only tells/asks you 1 thing, ""Can you handle being right or wrong this percentage of the time?"")* If I had to make a rule of thumb for somebody who wants to decide if they are ready to trade full time. It would have to be reverse engineered: **You need to find what your EV is and I'll show an example from a micro sample size of 10** You really do require a large sum of data. I mean it when I say, ""1,000 trades minimum or a full year of backtesting"" (Full year because the market does shift but in the end does not effect a day trader's performance... in MY experience in the long run). Those who get a random 20 or 50 or even 100 and think they're ready to go up against professionals who have electricity bills higher than your yearly income because their computers are running algos and statistics 24/7...you'll learn fast. [ 6 trades that resulted in +2R. 4 trades that resulted in -1R. Average of all = 0.8.. ""Expected"" is just how statisticians say, ""Average"". What this is saying is you can EXPECT 80¢ for every dollar you risk on the amount of trades you're testing. This is why when I lose a trade OR profit on a trade. I don't think, ""Wow I made $958 after slippage."" or ""Wow I lost $582 after slippage"". When I see my edge, I think to myself, ""Ok there's <EV> right there. I see income on every trade if it gets filled. Losing trades don't bother me. I have contingency plans... And don't ever say, ""I won that trade"". Businesses that sell <something> don't say, ""Oh cool we won"". You don't ""Win"" when you're assuming a risk. Trading isn't a game that you play. **2) Find how many trades on average you have. Let's say weeks 1-4. You have 20 trades on the first week, 1 on the second week, 0 on the third week, and 7 on the last week. (I'm using a micro-size sample here again. You really need A LOT more)** [ I can EXPECT 7 trades per week (ETW). IF I can expect 7 trades per week and each trade will result in 80¢ for every dollar I risk... Is this enough to cover my expenses AND TAXES SO THE GOVERNMENT CAN WASTE IT ON CRAP THAT DOESN'T HELP THE PEOPLE WHO PAY THEM.. and a little more so I can have a life outside of home. 7 trades per week \* $100 risk \* 0.8 per trade = Gross Income of $560 Maybe $560 (before taxes) is enough for you to survive. I don't know you or your personal finances, that's your business. For most.. it's not. So let's increase it to $250. For the sake of simplicity we know 250 ÷ 100 = 2.5. So $560 \* 2.5 = $1,400 EXPECTED (not guaranteed) per week.. GROSS income. You'll have to determine how much you need to set aside for taxes when you have that year of data that tells you what you can EXPECT to make that year. This seems more like it... I like this. **3) Does your account size and margin parameters allow for this?:** &#x200B; Let's say you have $37,500 in your account that has 4:1 leverage which allows for $150,000 in DayTrading Buying Power...and you're risking $250 a trade... Risk ÷ StopSize = Shares/Contracts to buy --> Shares to buy \* Price = Capital **Now let's visualize the data:** [ The 2nd position wouldn't have been able to be made. If you're running into buying power issues in your backtesting, either reduce your risk or find what's causing this. Perhaps it's the type of style you're trading or a certain pattern that has an inclination to exhaust buying power due to tight StopSizes (Tight StopSizes incur lots of slippage). Now most would say, ""Oh well I'll run into that if that ever happens. It's only 1 trade"". That's 100% wrong. Your goal is to be 100% efficient and copy your backtesting to a T. Trust me, it will happen, you will miss trades due to complacency when you haven't made a trade in over a week and you're a little rusty. So again in conclusion to the buying power metric, adjust accordingly. 4) Risk of Ruin. Is it under 1%? This is all discretionary. Me personally I want my RoR to be south of 0.25% but I've read many places that 1% is good. Probably just people repeating what everyone else says but that's just my opinion. How do you calculate it? There's a bunch of ways. [There]( are a bunch of [different websites]( that do a pretty good job that tell it all for you. But if you want it for your spreadsheets so you can visualize it and see how it matures over time: [RoR formula.]( So there it is! In conclusion. You take how much you need. Find your EV, see how many trades on average you get per day, week, month, quarter, etc., then see what's stopping you then assume that calculated risk by seeing what the odds of you failing are. That's the meat of it at least. There are a bunch others such as: •**Can you take that many trades and not miss any?** (It isn't smart to be firing off 30 trades a day. I know there are those who do it but like I've written before.. decision fatigue gets real. There's also a bunch of different ways to trade so I digress. Billions of dollars are exchanged between hands on NVDA on a daily basis. I might see 1 small edge on a 1' chart on 1 day out of the last 21 trading day month. Everyone sees fit trades all over the charts) •**Do you have an SOP for how you'll identify and enter your trades based on statistics?** For example I only allow for 10% of my R to be slipped on the entry because on average I get slipped on my stop outs 0.07R. So a losing trade could lose me 1.17R meanwhile the profiting trades achieve 1.9-1.99R depending on how bad I was filled according to my order tickets parameters. Take what info you got from your research and just pull the trigger. The market is liquid. A $50,000 position shouldn't faze you if you sized your position accordingly and set your StopLoss. Trading is a business. Take the leap if you're considering it. Just remember all the things you forfeit being independent from the normal job life. The market isn't going anywhere so you do have time and the time will never feel right. 2) Psychology - ( 2 paragraphs is really all it is) Although I can summarize that subject in 4-5 sentences: ""Read a few trading books. Put the ideas on a spreadsheet and see the results. Now trust it, write a business plan, follow it, and trade it live if you like the backtest results."" How much psychology does one need when: 1. Price is Up or Down 2. P/L is Green or Red 3. Result is Profit or Loss 4. A ticker is Showing Edge or No Edge 5. It's Heads or Tails. **But here's the answer to your psychology of trading questions... You are crippling yourself when you trade money you CANNOT AFFORD to lose.** You're uncomfortable risking money you can't afford to lose and now want some tumblr quote to help you sleep better at night. We all become Steve Cohen/Paul Tudor Jones when it says, ""Simulated Paper Trading"" or when the screen has an orange trim around the perimeter. Trade live when you're risking money you couldn't care less about... Because that's how it should be.... *But make sure you can respect it at the same time <- That's an important one (srs). Anybody can hit dingers in a batting cage, shoot 3's at an LA Fitness, or hit their 5iron 200+ yards at a driving range.. but when it becomes real, people fold.* Done with that subject but I'm sure in 48 hours there will be a psychology post. If you want to improve this subreddit, just reply to those questions, ""Trade with money you can afford to lose and not lose sleep over"". **All done. So I'll leave it with this:** Think of my timeline from my first day as a full time trader. September 2019. •That drawdown I had just 1 month in. No more cushion 9-5 income, no benefits, and the drawdowns happen. Just have a safety net and a StopLoss to start looking for a job if your account/savings go below a predetermined number. •When you've got politicians proposing a 0.2% Financial Transaction Tax on all stock trades. Doesn't sound like much to the average Joe but it would have destroyed any trading business. [Take this trade]( for example if that FTT was put into effect: **DISH** \- $33.30/share by 800 shares = $26,500 trade IN and \~$26,500 OUT | $53,000 moved. **TDOC** \- $186.00/share by 158 shares = $30,000 trade IN and \~$30,000 OUT | $60,000 moved. **SQ** \- $223.25/share by 220 shares = $49,000 trade IN and \~$49,000 OUT | $98,000 moved. That was a net slippage day meaning I hit break even losing 2R on 2 trades and gained 2R on 1 trade.. 0R but slippage caused me to lose roughly $100.. Now add that FTT... $211,000 \* 0.002 = $422 with a 0.2% FTT. Politicians would have ended this business for me and I love what trading life has afforded me.. time. •When March 2020 happened and the world shut down (Which put me in a position to start this thread). I couldn't train in a gym anymore for extra cash. There goes a source of income for me. I learned fast needless to say. You never know what's going to happen tomorrow. Me personally I leave it to God because it's in His hands. That's what helps take off the edge for me so whatever works for you, let it do its thing. There's lots of uncertainty in this business (as with any business) so either take the leap or not, just do it right. Following a written plan and honoring it day after day feels like a marathon but you learn to trust it. Until March 2022! *(I've got some more time in this business for me.)* \-CJT2013",6.843261227936146

18,2023-01-25 07:47:29,cambridge_probs,Overview of Nvidia's (NVDA) market action,"Overview of Nvidia's (NVDA) market action: * NVDA just reached its highest peak since last August. W shape with the later U less deep than the first one. This seems to reflect to a pre earnings call hike, we have seen similar movement in the likes of NFLX and MSFT. * NVDA momentum has crossed the 80th percentile, generally this would indicate that the momentum will tend to go down, either because the stock slows its growth or starts to drop down in price. * Volatility for NVDA is also above the 80th percentile, in fact it is the highest volatility rate we have seen in the last half year. This further consolidates the idea that the rate of price increase might be reaching its top, because the volatility will tend to drop below the 61% level. * The options market for NVDA expiring on Jan 27 is showing a bias towards PUTS over CALLS which generally indicates a bearish disposition from the market. We can also see that in the last 2 days the total open interest across all strikes doubled, so a lot of speculation going around. * NVDA seems to be a building up a resistance level at strike $200. With 9.5K contracts open at this level, we can expect a tug of war with MMs. * NVDA is also showing a definite support line at strike $180. 10K open contracts supporting this level. The next support afterwards would be $170. * Market Markers would need an extra $350M to hedge at strike $200 if the price of NVDA were to surpass this level. * Only 230K units of NVDA are being used to hedge strike $200. If we see an increase in build up at this level then we could envision that if NVDA doesn't reach $200 by Friday then most of those contracts will be closed and the market makers will wind down those hedged position, depressing the price. * The open interest of NVDA 180Put expiring on Jan 27, shows a massive 10x+ buildup in just one day at this level. * While the NVDA 180Put expiring on Jan 27 was building up a massive open interest, its probability of profit was dropping to around 11% * The market for NVDA 200 Call expiring on Jan 27 also saw a massive buildup of 4x+ in just one day. * The probability of Profit for NVDA 200 Call expiring on Jan 27 shoot up from below 5% to over 25% in the last 2 days, which would explain the buildup in open interest.",0.5405405405405408

21,2023-04-07 15:34:22,Cranky_Crypto,Hone Your Craft - Doing One Thing Exceptionally Well [With 23 Trade Examples],"*This post has been sitting in draft for a few months. I've decided to share it over the long weekend. Hopefully the charts are helpful to someone out there.* # Trading is an Uncertain Business I had some thoughts recently about **uncertainty** and how it causes a lot of the psychological issues in trading. I believe that not knowing what will happen next often leads to the **fear and anxiety** that we experience in front of the screens. Here's a little blurb I'd like to share with the trading community. # Rock-Solid Mentality Here are two ways to counter uncertain outcomes in trading. First, **know your setups like the back of your hand.** When you trade the same looking charts day-in and day-out, there are less decisions to make. Each pattern has a **STOP**, an **ENTRY**, and a **TARGET**. I abbreviate this as the **S.E.T. Trading Method**. Have a game plan before going into each trade. Be as mechanical as possible. This reduces the mental fatigue of '*winging it on the fly*'. [First trade of the year: Jan 3, 2023 - $TSLA Pullback Short +5R]( # Why I Prefer Trading the Same Setups Everyday Because I **rather be a specialist than a jack of all trades.** After 10,000+ of screen time, I have confidence in my two basic setups. They have proven themselves to me and put food on the table—**I trust the trend.** When a trend has been established, **pullbacks and breakouts are high-odds plays**. Price is already moving in one direction and waiting for you to hop onboard. The real challenge is having the patience/discipline to find an entry on the chart which resembles a pre-defined pattern. Your job is to locate a stop, an entry, and then **execute.** [Upside down version of chart above: Jan 6, 2023 - $AMAT Pullback Long +5R]( *I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.* **-Bruce Lee** Rather than trying to trade the same instrument/tickers every day, I scan for stocks that are forming patterns familiar to me. These momentary opportunities rarely present themselves during the random meandering of the market. But when they do appear, the probability of price continuing in one direction is substantially higher. As a trader, that is my life-line. It is when you put on risk: **I accept the possibility of losing capital in return for a chance of returning multiples of that loss.** *All you need is one pattern to make a living.* **-Linda Raschke** # Pattern #1A: Base Breakout [Jan 5, 2023 - $OI Breakout Long \(top\); Jan 6, 2023 - $CCJ Breakout Long \(bottom\)]( [Jan 9, 2023 - $AEHR Breakout Long]( [Jan 27, 2023 - $NVDA Breakout Long]( [Feb 13, 2023 - $FSLY Breakout Long]( # Pattern #1B: Base Breakdown [Jan 12, 2023 - $WMG Breakdown Short]( [Feb 2, 2023 - $GOOS Breakdown Short \(top\); $CVNA Breakdown Short \(bottom\)]( [Feb 8, 2023 - $CPRI Breakdown Short]( [Feb 9, 2023 - $APPS Breakdown Short \(top\); $GMED Breakdown Short rattled out for -1R \(bottom\)]( [Apr 6, 2023 - $NTR Breakdown Short]( # Pattern #2: Pullbacks Long and Short [Jan 5, 2023 - $SI Pullback Short]( [Jan 9, 2023 - $CRM Pullback Long \(top\); $DAL Pullback Long \(bottom\)]( [Jan 12, 2023 - $RCL Pullback Long]( [Feb 3, 2023 - $DDOG Pullback Short]( [Feb 10, 2023 - $XPO Pullback Short]( [Mar 3, 2023 - $VSCO Pullback Short]( # A Trader is First and Foremost a Risk Manager The second fact you should accept is that no matter how perfect a setup looks, you can still get stopped out. **This is why I am adamant about honoring your stops.** Sure, bag-holding or averaging down can save you more often than not. But it's only a matter of time before that one trade catches you with your pants down. You will regret even waking up that morning. It's just not worth the potential heartache and pain. [Jan 5, 2023 - $CRWD Pullback Short Fail -1R]( Take the stop and get back in if there's a reason to. Move onto something else if the chart that tagged you is no longer behaving as expected. # Have Faith I can accept being wrong half the time because I know that when I am right, my winners are paying me 2x-5x compared to my losers. **A loss is just part of the process of capturing the next winner.** Getting stopped out should not make you feel upset or vengeful. The only time to get emotional after a loser is if you took an impulse trade. And how do we reduce the frequency of that happening? See the first point: **know your setups like the back of your hand and trust that they make money in the long-run.** [Jan 31, 2023 - $MRNA Breakdown Short Fail -1R]( # Time is an Arbitrary Unit of Measure Don't measure performance based on individual trades, days, or even weeks. **Focus on the forest rather than the trees.** With a valid edge, your winners will add up and negate your losers over a large enough sample size. That fact alone should give you the confidence to help overcome some of the uncertainty that is inherent in trading. **Individual outcomes do not matter in the long run.** The only factors in your control before and during the trade are: * Valid setup? **✅** * Good entry? **✅** * Stop valid? **✅** * Target feasible? **✅** There isn't much else you can do except **let the trade play out.** Win or lose, your focus should shift to **finding the next trade.**",0.09831460674157219

25,2023-05-24 16:05:16,DaddyDersch,"The daily abandoned baby… 5-24-23 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ and VIX Daily Market Analysis (bonus NVDA earnings)","Well going into today I actually found myself to be fairly bullish and I truly expected a bounce and for us to close much higher than we closed yesterday. However, that clearly did not happen and clearly was wrong to be a bull up here. Looking at SPY and QQQ daily here it would appear that I was a day early… With SPY and QQQ closing out there abandoned baby daily bullish reversal candles honestly the temptation to swing calls is insanely high… However, I actually back tested my swing trades dating back to early 2022 and I actually am net negative on swings alone… so as much as they are enticing… not worth it to me. Now for those of you that don’t know what the abandoned baby pattern is… it’s a rarity and doesn’t always play out but when it does it usually results in a pretty massive move up… May 4th is the best example of that daily pattern. **NVDA EARNINGS** &#x200B; There is literally nothing else that I can describe this market right now then “WOW.” I Just can not imagine the fact that a company with a PE near 200 can rally almost 27% on earnings and be near the ATHs… that truly is mindboggling. This market reminds me a lot of the spring of 2021… **SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** &#x200B; Now from a supply and demand stand point we didn’t do anything different today. The most intriguing thing is the fact that we actually gapped under the 413.05 supply. So generally speaking to have a previous supply taken out you must close a new supply over it and then you must touch that level with price action… a gap down completely changes that metric. So for now that 413.05 level remains on the books. We did come down and test 410.2 demand (Support) and hold that nicely today. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema for the first time since May 4th. Honestly, I can no help but notice the similarities of todays candle to May 4ths daily candle. If that is the case we likely could see a green open tomorrow and green day tomorrow. This would give us an opportunity to turn 411.16 into a new higher demand. However, IF bears can continue this momentum lower then more likely than not our target is daily demand (support) at 404.32/ 405.12. The daily DMI has officially reset to over sold but has not started its wave up. So we are in the early stages of finding the next bottom…. However, keep in mind that the DMI can remain oversold for a period of time before it retraces. **SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** &#x200B; On the Daily we clearly broke through support of the red and black rising wedge. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema. However, we once again are finding support at the daily 50ema. We will keep an eye on this blue bear channel with resistance at 415.2 for tomorrow. In all honestly it appears that I was just one day too early on the bull rally… with NVDA this very well is the dip buy opportunity before we push hard to the 420-430 area again. SPY Daily Levels Supply- 413 -> 418.8 Demand- 410.2 -> 405.1 Support- 411.1 -> 410.2 -> 408.9 Resistance- 412.5 -> 414.1 -> 417.1 **FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** &#x200B; Futures came down and took out that 4149 supply that they had fell just short of yesterday. With this log wicked doji I do expect some upside tomorrow. However, the one interesting thing here is that right now this new daily candle has still not tried to put a new demand (support) in… DMI remainds oversold though so favor would be a short term bounce coming soon. If we get a green day and green bounce on futures tomorrow with a closure over 4165 then we should try to turn 4145 into a new demand (Support). However, if we fall through 4127 demand tomorrow then our target would be 4075 demand. **FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** &#x200B; Same story here on futes is that we did push a daily candle through the red and black daily rising wedge and now we find ourselves looking at this blue resistance line and that 4159 will be a major resistance to watch that futures actually is hard rejecting after hours here. If this is a back test and rejection of the daily 8ema on futures this could be a very bearish movement with the ultimate target being 4095 support. Futures Daily Levels Supply- 4055 -> 4208 Demand- 4128 -> 4075 Support- 4125 -> 4110 -> 4095 Resistance- 4159 -> 4171 -> 4190 -> 4208 **QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** &#x200B; QQQ did close the same bullish abandoned baby pattern here as SPY… QQQ missed its intraday gap fill by about 9 cents. The daily 20ema will sit just over that 326.82 supply tomorrow and if the bears can continue to sell the markets off (which will be very hard to see QQQ drop with NVDA up 28%) then we should target that 326.82 supply. Looking here you can see we have a major demand (support) are at 325/326 and that should be a big area where we could bounce If we do see a continuation sell off. However, if we get a green day tomorrow we likely will see the DMI wave back up with a new demand being established at 331.32. This would lead QQQ to target 336.37 demand. I actually will look to take some longer 14-30dte calls on QQQ if we do see that play out tomorrow. QQQ Daily Levels Supply- 337.6 -> 326.82 -> 322.31 Demand- 336.37 -> 325.99 -> 34.99 **VIX** &#x200B; One reason I am also particularly bullish is the fact that the VIX attempted to break out over that critical 20.08 level and rejected. This rejection is a near perfect double top off the May 4th VIX candle which is when SPY put its bottom in… If the VIX retraces tomorrow and closes under 20.08 again then I would feel far more confident that we are going to see a bigger upside move on SPY… The next major upside level for the VIX is 21.36 and downside level is 18.86. **DAILY TRADING LOG** &#x200B; Honestly this was a terrible trading day just from a day trading stand point… 0dte premiums were so juiced because of Yellen and FOMC minutes and we had really such little overall movement that plays just weren’t paying out very well… I really did okay trading intraday and my day trades were green by my swing calls were obviously red and that gave me a good sized hole. Still working on a nice week of gains here but definitely not my best day of trading.",6.67418013641035

As practice, I've been eyeballing them for everyday for awhile now and just getting used to how they move. I'd like to (if at all possible) focus on these stocks and be very familiar with their price action , idiosyncrasies and characteristics. My focus is to only focus on the first hour. Problem is, I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking for and it's probably too soon for me understand the nuances of each of these stocks. Do these stocks react at certain levels? Do they act a certain way during a time of the day? Are they sensitive to movements of the SPY or QQQ? Any pros out there care to provide some guidance on this? Or is this a futile endeavour? Cheers &#x200B;",8.695054945054945
27,2023-06-23 01:18:23,MaintenanceWorldly47,Told myself i wouldnt blow this account and i did,"Lost -500 on 4 nvda contracts yesterday. Then lost another 400 today while holding. -900 lost on a 1,200$ account . I feel like such an idiot and I’ve got nobody to blame except myself. I’ve blown accounts before and its all because i either sized up too heavy w no stoploss or just not following stoploss in general. Got nobody to talk to about it because none of my friends are traders and i don’t want to be that negative friend . I did the same mistake ive been doing for 2 years now and im pissed at myself for doing it. I slept 4 hours the day this happened and every time i sleep less than 6 hours a night i always do something stupid while trading. I feel like if i had slept a bit more i would have realized at the moment that i am about to do some stupid shit but i had just woken up for market open and still kinda sluggish from just waking up and just did not think at all. Yes i know im retarded and i feel retarded and it’s honestly embarrassing sharing my L making the same mistakes over and over again . Blew off steam at the gym and got 264$ left in the trading account. Going to wait for my setups , size light, and be patient and have my stops set already as soon as i enter the trade. I’m done losing money for all these years because of the same bullshit i cant handle the emotional stress anymore. I just wanted to share cause i was just feeling crazy today and have nobody to talk to about this 🤷‍♂️ “insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting things to change” im never going to give up ever cause id be such a pussy if i did . winners never quit and quitters never win.",-17.266666666666666

37,2023-12-19 05:38:45,TearRepresentative56,I'm a professional trader and this is some of my notes on what's been happening in premarket.,"Note: I tried to take on some of the feedback from yesterdays post and provide a bit more analysis, although I keep some more back for my personal notes. Hopefully you can find value in this post though. **What happened yesterday, and thoughts on this:** * Yesterday, SPX and Nasdaq made marginally new highs, whilst Dow was flat. This despite fed officials continuing to try to walk back rate cut optimism. * This move higher in SPX and Nasdaq was driven by Mag7 again, with exception of Apple and Tesla. We can see the mag7 dominance by the fact that QQQ rose by 0.43%, whilst QQQEqualweight was down for much of the day. * Oil was higher on Red Sea disruption, particularly after BP said they would not be using the Red Sea Routes after Houthi attacks. This forces them through the Suez Canal which delays oil shipments by 2 weeks on average. * Steel stocks pumped after Nippon Steel agree deal for X, although Senator Fetterman says he intends to try to stop the deal. * Solar stocks notable losers as Sunpower raises doubts over its ability to continue as going concern, which dragged other Solar stocks lower. * Vix remained suppressed around 12 which is supporting the market higher. **My Thoughts:** * Personally seeing signs that the market is topped out. Saw Tesla reached resistance near 260 but got rejected. NVDA now trading at 500, which I think is a psychological level that sellers will be sitting at, so would expect it to get rejected there over next few days. Apple trading near 200, which I think will be a psychological level sellers will be at. To be honest, I would have expected Apple to be down more than 0.85% with news of Apple Watch sales being paused and China accelerating their Apple ban in government institutions. * Snapchat got a very bullish analyst upgrade but was flat on the day, which can be a sign madcaps are topping out too after a very bullish run. * Nasdaq (IXIC, not NDX) now coming close to 15k which will see sellers sitting there. * Other than lack of headwinds in the market in coming days in terms of data, I think market is close to key resistance levels. **TODAY’S DATA LEDE/MACRO EVENTS:BOJ RATES DECISION - recall from previous reddit post, my expectation was for BOJ to hold rates despite speculation of possible hike.** * Made no change to negative interest rate, holding benchmark at -0.1%Yield curve control unchanged. * People had speculated that they would tighten which pumped up yen. Yen to now retrace those gains. * BOJ spoke of “extremely high uncertainties” and said more needs to be seen to determine if “positive wage inflation cycle is in place”. * Seeing gradual improvement in inflation but still not in a position to be sufficiently confident. * Didn’t remove the rhetoric about “won’t hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary”. Thats quite dovish **ANALYSIS:**BEFORE SPECULATION THAT BOJ WOULD TIGHTEN, USDJPY WAS TRADING AT 147.22JXY was trading at 68.Probably needs to retrace close to back to this.As Yen falls, Japanese equities going to become cheaper, so Nikkei will likely pump for few days now. &#x200B; **AUSTRALIA RBA MINUTES - For meeting where RBA went back to pausing after hiking again last month.** * Board considered whether to raise rates by 25 bps or to keep steady. Decided on pause. * Will continue to analyse the data to determine future policy. * Some encouraging signs on inflation that need to continue. **ANALYSIS**:Not much to these comments to be honest. Continued data driven rhetoric.**US** **BUILDING PERMITS AND HOUSING STARTS DATA COMING.** **———— FX ——————** * Yen lower, propping up USDJPY. USDJPY was trading at 147 before speculation of tightening. Since that didn’t materialise, USDJPY needs to retrace. * Money rotating out of yen into other currencies like AUD, GBP etc * Note Risk reversal on dollar index has touched lowest since 2020, and options pointing to substantial drop in USD. This would support equity markets. * Note: Dollar and US equities are most inversely correlated since May - Can watch for some correction there. **———— OPTIONS —————** * 4800 remains sticky strike * Record Call skew - Bullish. * Single Digit implied Vol * CTAs moving supporting on Brent Crude now - algorithmic strategies supporting oil **——— MARKETS OVERVIEW ———** * Markets: Flat as you would expect in premarket when they are trading at all time highs and there’s little macro catalysts to drive them notably higher right now. * NIKKEI: Japanese stocks pumping after ultra easy monetary policy maintained for foreseeable future. Makes yen lower and Japanese equities cheaper * GER40:Majority of sectors slightly green. * HKG50: NOTE: I’m holding positions in the HKG50. I think it’s undervalued and people will rotate from US equities into HKG at some point. * OIL: Flat this morning after pushing yday, although it did pare those gains when US said they will help to safeguard Red Sea vessels. Launched a task force. This reduces risk premium and made oil fall again.Yields: Flat, slightly lower **——— INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ———** * PIMCO SAYS THEY THINK UK WONT ACHIEVE SOFT LANDING. Said they are betting against GBP. Said UK consumers feeling brunt of interest rates more than US as less on 30 year fixed mortgages. * MS’s MIKE WILSON SAYS US EQUITIES HAVE GREEN LIGHT TO MOVE HIGHER. - Another Bear capitulates. To be honest, I see this as a sign of market topping out too. * GOLDMAN releases paper saying UST yields are higher in short term, but near historical averages. Bullsh\*t report really. They’re high, lets be real. Highest since 2005. * GOLDMAN’s SENTIMENT INDICATOR TICKED UP TO 1.1. Points to stretched equity positioning. Due a correction. **——— Company Specific ————** Quite a flat premarket, not TOO much company specific news driving big moves. Piper Sandler put out some pieces in analyst reviews on solar sector. * SEDG - Downgraded at Piper Snalder to neutral, price target at 105 (which is 15% above spot) * RUN - Piper Sandler upgraded to overweight, raising price target to 31 , 72% above spot. Because RUN is more sensitive to cutting rates * TSM - TSMC chairman, Mark Liu will retire in 2024, but CEO is recommended as successor, so still very in house succession plan. * BA - receives an order of up to 100 737 Max jets from Lufthansa * UBS - Activist investor Cevian Capital is investing $1.2b into UBS, with expectation they will overtake Morgan Stanley as world’s top wealth management company. * SALESFORCE AGREES TO ACQUIRE SPIFF - TERMS OF DEAL not DISCLOSED * ENPH WILL CUT GLOBAL WORKFORCE BY 10%, This represents 350 workers. This is part of a restructuring plan. They will take a $16m restructuring charge from this. Also stopped manufacturing plant operations in Wisconsin and Romania. * LUMN - appoints a new Chief Product officer * ARRY - JPM remains buy on ARRY, Piper Sandler however downgrades to neutral, price target set 16% above spot. * ZIM - continues higher on ongoing Houthi disruptions * LTHM - Allkem shareholders vote in favour of Livent merger **------- OTHER NEWS HEADLINES: ---------** * GAS PRICES AT CHEAPEST LEVEL OF YEAR, AS WINTER TEMPERATURES WARMER THAN EXPECTED * CHINA SECURITIES REGULATOR TELLS COMPANIES TO INCREASE DIVIDENDS AND BUYBACKS - bullish * BOA FUND MANAGER SURVEY: What are others doing?Moving overweight on bonds nowOverweight equities too90% say fed hikes over73% say Yen undervaluedALL OF THESE ARE OBVIOUS OBSERVATIONS * ECB’s VILLEROY COMMENTS - Dovish.Was making positive comments on France growth prospects.Said We will be able to lower interest rates some time in 2024, as wages grow faster than inflation now.Not going to raise any further. * Note: ECB’s SIMKUS AND VUJCICALSO TALKING TODAY WALKED BACK SOME OF THIS DOVISHNESS. SAID MARKET AHEAD OF ITSELF. * MAGNITUDE 5.5 EARTHQUAKE HITS XINJIANG REGION OF CHINA. 105 people were killed, 390 injured and 4,700 houses damaged * CHINA CENTRAL BANK ADVISER REMAINS BULLISH ON CHINA to ACHIEVE 5% GDP GROWTH IN 2024. * HOUTHI ATTACKS IN THE RED SEA COTNINUE - US central command report 2 more attacks on Dec 18th, striking oil tankers. * CLIMATE GROUPS SUE UK OVER North Sea OIL PROJECT * **FED DALY - rate cuts could be needed next year to prevent over tightening** **——— FAANG NEWS (can move markets) ———** * AAPL - still trying to work out what to do about their smartwatch halt. Trying to rescue the situation by doing software tweak. NOTE; THIS SITUATION IS GENUINELY BEARISH AND WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON AAPL TOP LINE. * TESLA - PLANNING 10% OR HIGHER HOURLY PAY RATE FOR SOME WORKERS AT NEVADA BATTERY PLANT FROM JANUARY * TESLA - less market impact as its very much in future, but TESLA is supposedly working on a wireless charging pad where you just park over it and it automatically charges your vehicle. * GOOGL - will pay $700m in play store settlement, agreeing to make changes to App Store. Was in an anti trust dispute. NOTE: THIS IS A SMALL FINE FOR THEM AND NO BIG DEAL. **——— EARNINGS REPORT ————** HEICO:Will read during the day. Is too pumped up right now and I was hoping for a correction aftermarket. Didn’t come so not an immediate priority to read before market open. Wont be buying it at these prices.I just read a short overview with summary that aerospace product demand was strong, and acquisitions helped to fuel their growth. Without acquisitions, still 12% organic sales growth though. So strong performance. &#x200B;",9.967906678727573
38,2023-12-20 05:31:43,TearRepresentative56,20/12 I'm a professional trader and these are some of my notes from premarket.,"**I want to start this post by clarifying some of my comments in yesterdays post, and responding to some of the user comments there.** * When I said the market looks like it can be topping out, I am in no way saying I am a bear, nor am I saying I am short on the market. This is the US stock market. Obviously, in the long run, it is ultimately going to go up, and break highs. To clarify, I am still long the market. What I was saying was that barring a catalyst, which it doesn’t appear there is in the near term, I do not see a sharp move higher. I am not saying the market cannot move 0.4% higher etc day to day. It can, especially when there is nothing on the economic calendar in way of headwinds. The market is moving on optimism and can continue to move in the direction it is, especially when VIX is so suppressed. What I am saying is that if you look at the economic calendar, there’s not much this side of the new year to help push it higher forcefully.Instead, when you look at certain factors which I will break down here, it seems likely there will be some short term correction, before it again moves higher.Firstly, Mag 7 trading near resistance, which it will have to break. E.g. NVDA rejected at 500. AAPL rejected at 200. Obviously a news story can break these resistances, but trading right against them, makes it more likely for them to come down than go up.Same can be said for indices, with SPX just below all time highs, which will probably act as a resistance. * Secondly, look at market breadth. More than 90% of stocks are trading above their 50 day Moving average. This makes sense to be honest, when you consider the rate cut optimism. But at the same time, if you look at the last 3 instances that this has happened, in each of them, the market has done short term corrections. The last time that it was able to reach a level where market breadth was at 90% and still move higher was in 2021. To be honest, I do not see enough similarities in the economic picture today to in 2021 to suggest this will happen again now. Interest rates are much higher, economic growth is slowing, consumer is holding up but there’s still uncertainty as to how long it can. * For this reason, I see it as more likely than not that there will be short term correction before it moves higher again. * I am still long the market. We operate a long only fund, so we never short. What we do do, is fluctuate our cash position to reflect the headwinds and tailwinds in the market, or you can say, the risk/reward in the market. Right now, I have trimmed my positions, and have closed my swing trades/active trades. I still have my passive positions all running. To this end, if the market moves higher for whatever reason, and I am proved wrong, I am happy, because my passive positions are doing well. If it price corrects, I am also happy as I can put my swing trades back in and utilise my cash position. This is what trading is all about in our strategy, using the cash position to hedge ourselves such that we benefit if the market goes up, or comes down. * *I will now continue with the normal posts:* **What happened yesterday, and some of my trades from yesterday:** * Was off the desk yesterday, due to family bereavement. * From what I can see, market continued to push higher from open. SPX is now 0.6% below all time high, whilst DJI and Nasdaq closed at all time high.Dollar was lower, whilst bond yields were flat. * Only order I placed was for a small day trade in ARRY, entering at 18, for 2.6% gain, after its rating was cut by analyst. * My sell order on short term trade in AVAV also executed at 130. &#x200B; * ***Because I was off the desk yesterday specifically, I will insert a section here on general market conditions, for those who want a bit of a summary, those who don’t can skip.*** * Market breadth continues to increase. The QQQ Equal weight, which negates the heavy weighting of the Mag 7, has moved from 52 week low to 52 week high across last month and a half.40% of stocks on the S&P are now above 70 RSI * Goldman Sachs custom indices of unprofitable and heavily shorted stocks up 12% in last week, which tells you people are short covering and continuing to move into those stocks which have potential to run up with rate cuts. * Discretionary stocks now at their highest level of outperformance vs Staples since January 2022. * Put interest still very low, traders are chasing not hedging. **————— EARNINGS ————** * FEDEX earnings: Was trading at 52 week highs going into the print, up around 20% from last earnings, which puts pressure on the earnings being good. * EPS of 3.99 missed estimates by 5%Revenue of 22.2b was down 3% yoy, and missed estimates by 1%Express Revenue still not picked up in last 4 quarters. * Continues to see less shipments. Package volume down YOY. Perhaps less benefit from the UPS strikes than expected. Bit disappointing.Continuing on efficiency and cost reduction program (DRIVE). Cost reductions of $1.8bTo this end, cost per packaging declined 2%, due to lower line haul expense, and better last mile productivity.Demand remains uncertainBuybacks on stock of $1b in FY 2024 * Guidance:Cut full year revenue guidance - to fall single digit %, vs previous outlook of flatEPS guidance fell short at 17.75 at midpoint, miss consensus by 3% * Conclusion:Yes margins expanded on lower revenues to help bottom line, but operating margin still fell short of expectations. Package volume decline showed limited benefit from UPS strikesNot enough has improved at all to justify how high it is trading. * Overall, 5/10. Not terrible, but not good enough vs where its trading. Actually cut full year guidance, vs last quarter, when stock price is 20% higher. **————— DATA LEDE —————** * **JAPANESE BALANCE OF TRADE DATA -** Imports fell more than expected, whilst exports were more or less flat. * This in theory should prop up the Yen as less imports means less selling of JPY. Seems to align with when Yen started going up last night, although the move is partly price correction from yesterday’s drop. * **UK CPI (Nov) -** As noted in my Sunday post, I expected it to come in soft in line with US, and other European peers. GBP to fall slightly. * This proved correct, as it came in well below expectations at 3.9% vs 4.4% expected.Core also fell to 5.1% vs 5.6% expected. Lowest core reading and headline reading in more than 2 years. * MOM move was deflationary. * This result is good for UK economy. Whilst Bailey at last meeting was signalling higher for longer, and UK and US situations are different, this datapoint shows that UK are starting to catch US up on inflation fighting front. May see rate cuts sooner than expected in UK.GBP falls on this, as it signals BOE can maybe move more dovish than before. * **US - Consumer Confidence (Dec)** \- After market open, so hold early trading in anticipation of this. * **US - 20 year bond auction**. Can move bond yields which can influence markets. Likely will see decent demand which will keep bond yields lower. **———— FOREX ————** * GBP moves lower on soft inflation numbers, which suggests BOE may be able to be more dovish than first thought. * Yen doing some price correction after yesterday’s move lower. Also moving higher as Japan plans to issue more government bonds in 2024, increased demand for Yen.EUR lower slightly, in sentiment with GBP * Note: Am holding GBPUSD as I believe that the BOE will hold rates higher than the Fed. Today’s inflation surprise does bring that into question a bit, but still think BOE will be more hawkish than Fed. I had trimmed a tiny bit ahead of the inflation print, so will put that back in soon. **——— MARKETS —————** * DJI hit new all time highs in premarket again, near 37,600 then pared gain as European markets sold off after open. * SPX and NASDAQ similar story. Mostly flat in premarket. We expect this to continue, as barely any news catalysts around, VIX is suppressed, and GEX is very high which tells us volatility will be lower. * GERMAN market quite flat, rejected at 16,800 today. * UK at 3 month high following inflation data which fuelled rate cut bets. * NIKKEI higher again on dovish BOJ yesterday as they signal ultra easy monetary to continue * HKG50 opened higher, around 16,750 then sold off the gains, down 0.77% * Oil moving higher by 1% in premarket. Continues higher on Red Sea complications. According to the downtrend I have drawn, which I think it will eventually break to the upside, oil is now close to the top of the downtrend, and may on a technical analysis basis do some correction here. My near term price target for oil overall is 80 though. * Bond yields slightly lower in premarket today, which can support equities. But it’s only marginally lower so likely to have no impact. 10y lowest since July **————— OPTIONS ————** * GEX continues to grow - which lowers volatility4800 still sticky strike. 0dte tells us this is likely to be the max range today.HVL at 4645, 2.3% below spot. **———— INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ————** * Didn’t read too much as was off the desk yesterday. Here’s what I did read. * DataTrek review 30 day rolling correlations of Daily returns on SPX vs individual large cap sectors, to suggest that the current rally has around 1-2 weeks left to run. They suggested that past that, market optimism would have pushed too far too fast. * Bank of America’s fund manger survey yesterday showed equities saw largest inflow since October 2022. Tech saw the biggest inflows, industrials saw the biggest outflows. Dont; take too much notice of this inflows/outflows news. Ultimately, Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 9 straight days of gains. * Bank of America also put out a piece saying that although credit card delinquencies have risen sharply over the last year, households on average remain flush with liquid assets. This is something we knew as Black Friday sales showed increase in Buy now pay later. * Societe Generale: Market finds it easier to price monetary policy impact (rate cuts) than impact of inflation trends on margins. Last year, they misplaced hikes, vs impact of inflation on profits. For 2024, could be the other way around. AKA they are saying markets are probably pricing too much cuts. * Unicredit - “Current enthusiasm seems somewhat exaggerated from short term perspective, and setback is highly likely”. Positives are priced in. **——MAG 7 NEWS ( CAN MOVE MARKETS) ——** * Generally flat, so the headlines outlined below are not considered big enough to have a market moving impact. * **AAPL** \- financial impact of the smartphone ban not likely to be as severe as some first thought. Dan Ives estimates it to be about a $400m impact to sales over Holiday period. Is a drop vs their revenue. * **GOOGL** \- plans to reorganise a big part of its 30,000 person ad sales unit. * **TESLA** \- Reuters report that Tesla blamed drivers for failure of parts it knew were defective. * **TSLA** \- VW has signed an agreement with Tesla to adopt North American Charging standard from 2025. * **TESLA** \- will skip yearly media based employee stock awards * **TESLA** \- Analysts at JL Warren Capital say that Tesla cut their prices for their EV cars in China by more than BYD did for its flagship car.

THIS WAS WRITTEN A COUPLE OF HOURS BEFORE **————— OTHER HEADLINES ———** * AFTER CPI DATA, UK INTEREST RATE SWAPS NOW PRICE 140bps of easing vs 117bps before CPI. Now markets beginning to price a cut by March. * GOOLSBEE COMMENTS AFTER MARKET:Cautioned against euphoria in markets.Inflation will determine easing.What market is pricing won’t influence the Fed * BOSTIC yday reiterated that the Fed won’t wait till 2% inflation to start cuts. Said he expects 2 cuts in 2024. * MORE ECB OFFICIALS CAUTION ON INVESTORS BETTING ON RATE CUTS. This time it was ECB’s Nagel, who said “be careful, others have miscalculated before” * FRANCE SEE EASING INFLATION EXPECTATIONS, GOOD FOR EUROZONE. * GERMAN 10Y BONDS FALL BELOW 2% FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH. This on Rate cut hope for ECB. This has been supporting the GER40 to all time highs. * South Korea C BANK CHIEF SAYS MARKETS ARE OVERREACTING TO POWELL’s DOVISH COMMENTS.

39,2023-12-21 05:45:30,TearRepresentative56,I'm a professional (news driven) trader and these are some of my notes from premarket,"**What happened yesterday, and my thoughts:** * Yesterday, we saw the market start to do a little correction. There wasn’t much news behind the move, except for the fact that VIX options expired, and QQQ failed to break the Call resistance 0DTE at 410. This may have contributed as VIX options had been suppressing VIX till now, and the expiration reset the options positioning a little. As such, VIX moved higher rapidly from 12.5 to 14. For the most part though, this was just normal mean reversion. * Markets have been at all time highs, up 16% on SPX since October lows, with 90% of stocks above their 50 day moving average. The market had just become a little too stretched, and needed to breathe. * Note that this is of course a very small correction in the scale of the move the market has just done, and is very healthy. Moving indefinitely higher is what’s not healthy. The market has to absorb and digest that move, before moving higher again. In premarket already, we can see the market already start to pare the drop. Over the next few days we will see volume dry up a little going into the Xmas break, and there isn’t much on the economic calendar in the way of major catalysts. With lower volume, we may see markets trade flat, or we can see exacerbated moves in either direction. With little on the economic calendar, it’s hard to guess exactly which way markets will move on a day to day basis. E..g markets are up in premarket, but this can easily fade to retest 4700 at least. On the whole, markets are still stretched despite the 500 point drop on the Dow, but this isn’t to say that today will be red. I caution against making day to day predictions because people call me up if they are in any way wrong. Look, we as investors aren’t fortune tellers, especially when there’s little on the economic calendar to guide us. We can only assess the overall state of the market, to determine risk reward. As readers had noted, I had left my passive positions running (trimmed a bit) and had sold all my active/swing trades, to build cash, because I suspected a near term small correction. I didn’t put the cash into the market yesterday. The dip happened so close to the close that why would I put it in just before, when I have no idea how markets will open tomorrow, especially with little particularly in premarket in way of economic news? The correction, whilst sudden, was still small. So personally, I am waiting to see more before I put the money I had trimmed, back into the market. If it moves higher form here, which premarket points to (although premarket movement means little), I will still be happy as my passive positions make money. **My Trades:** * (Explaining trades I made in my personal portfolio. People have mentioned rightly not to share too much details about company work, so I have shared trades I was executing in my personal port instead) * In terms of what I did yesterday, I explained in yesterday’s post that oil was trading at the top of the downward channel that had been forming. I thought it could easily get rejected there, so I trimmed half my oil positions, and left half running. My price target on oil is 80, so I left some going to meet that, but knew that this could easily get rejected at the top of that channel, so took some out. Technical analysis suggests it can even move lower to 67 now, although you’d have to see a move higher in dollar for that to happen. * I also trimmed my enphase position because I was off the desk the day before. Note: I still have some running. I also have positions in FSLR and ARRY. I am bullish on solar still for next year. The reason why I sold some was because I was holding form 80. It was up a lot, and whilst interest rate cuts will help them a lot next year, it doesnt immediately change their near term earnings, which were guided last quarter to be terrible. A 62% move higher in quick time was good enough for me to take some profits here. ———— **TODAY’S DATA LEDE/MACRO EVENTS:** * **UK CBI Trades data:** * One of the less important metrics for the Uk, but does give some telling insight, especially because it was such a miss to the downside. Came out -32 vs forecast of -14. It’s a leading indicator of retail performance, so signals a weakening retail sector in UK. (Little impact in GBPUSD because it is a small indicator) * **US GDP Final Revision (Q3) - Expected to remain above 5%** PCE revisions too * note: these are both revisions, and barring a big surprise, won’t move markets too much as should be confirming previous readings. * **US Jobless Claims** ———— **INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH** * Evercore says that they see a big pullback in first half of 2024, as recession “materialises”. * Goldman put out a piece where they compared the performance of small caps vs large caps in various markets over the last 12 months. There, they concluded that smalls have only outperformed large in emerging markets. Other than it, in Japan, Europe, US and others, they have underperformed large caps. This is something we all mostly knew anyway, since Mag7 led the rally most of the year. I suppose for those that don’t follow other markets, it’s interesting to know this was the case in other markets too. * Goldman put out another piece looking at average inflation across G10 economies. They estimated that across them, core inflation ran at just 2.2% over past 3 months and 1.3% in November alone. * Hedge funds net long positions on crude hit record low going back to 2011. * Fitch says they expect their next moves from the Fed, ECB and BOE to be cuts - no sh\*t Sherlock. No more hikes from here. * Interesting fact: Statista shows that international tourism finally reaches pre pandemic level. ——— **FOREX** * GBP was lower yesterday after soft CPI print and continued slightly lower today. Trading 1.265. Note: I hold position in GBPUSD * USDJPY continues doing correction as yen moves higher. This is correction after Yen sell off following BOJ dovishness. Note, can bounce off of 142.59. Then again, can not. Depends on initial jobless claims numbers as they can move the dollar. * AUD moving higher again. ————— **MARKETS** * SPX: Sold off yesterday a bit back to 4700. Held that level in aftermarket, and pared losses to 4722. ( up 0.5% from lows of yesterday) * Nasdaq: Fell to 16,550 yesterday, pared some of those losses in premarket, up 0.7% in premarket from the lows. * GER40 tracked the sell off in US overnight. Was relatively flat since. * HKG: Opened much lower, after US sell off. Recovered 1.6% from there. Basically pushed up right from the open. Partly due to China economic stimulus measure announcements e.g. cutting deposit rate * OIL: Failed to break out of downward channel yesterday. Still testing it in premarket. Needs to close above 75 on daily to break out. * VIX: pushed up after expiration. Now at 13 handle. * Bond yields slightly higher today, probably as sellers take from bonds into equities. —————— **OTHER NEWS HEADLINES:** * BIDEN IS CONSIDERING SOME TRUMP STYLE TARIFFS ON CHINESE GOODS. These are particularly form the Chinese EV market. * SUGGESTION FROM LOCAL CHINESE NEWSPAPER THAT CHINA LARGE BANKS WILL CUT DEPOSIT RATES ON FRIDAY by 10 BPS and 20 BPS respectively on 1 and 2 year. That will encourage less saving and more spending. Its a stimulating measure. Has been done before and in reality won’t change that much but its a step in right direction. * PBOC COMMITS TO KEEP LIQUIDITY AMPLE. This comes as their FDI came out weak, down 10% YOY for 2023. * CHINA WILL REDUCE IMPORT TARIFFS ON SCARCE RESOURCES IN 2024 and WILL LOWER EXPORT TAX FOR HIGH PURITY ALUMINIUM. More measures to try to stimulate domestic economy from an inward and outward perspective. * ECB’S DE GUINDOS follows other ECB officials over last couple of days in walking back rate cut talks. In reality, they are just trying to stop financial conditions easing too much. Rate cuts will come H1 2024. He said current rates are required to bring inflation down. * US, JAPAN AND SK ALL CONDEMN North Korea BALLISTIC MISSILE LAUNCHES. * IKEA says that they will face delayed problems too, due to Red Sea diversions **————— MAG 7 NEWS ————** * AAPL - Yesterday, during market news broke that Apple is trying o ramp up their Vision pro production, aiming for a February launch. * AAPL - Yesterday, also lost their bid to delay the Apple Watch Ban. * AMZN - Wedbush raises price target to 210 from 180. * TSLA - potential import tariff on Chinese EV is bullish for Tesla. * TSLA - Is being probed by the Norweigian Roads Agency over suspension failures, relating to Model S and Model X. * NVDA - up on Micron earnings **——— EARNINGS ————** * MICRON earnings were out - I won’t have time in premarket to read this one thoroughly due to being off the desk for part of today due to family bereavement. * Here are the analyst price targets after the Earnings though: * Wolfe: Raised to 100 from 80 UBS: raised to 95 from 90 Stifel: Raised to 80 from 76 Deutsche: Raised to 90 from 85 Citi: Raised to 95 from 88 Goldman: Raise from 97 to 85 JPM raised to 105 from 90 Mizuho raised to 95 from 86 * Note Q2 forecast for MU was better than expected **———— COMPANY SPECIFIC ————** * Mining stocks like RIOT MARA are up following Bit at the 44k resistance again * Chipmakers generally are higher following Micron earnings, where they forecasted their Q2 revenue to eb above expectations. * Automakers can be up due to discussion of potential import tariff on Chinese EV. Note, this won’t affect others as much as Tesla as GM, Ford and others have all started scaling back thier Ev launch. * UBER - will raise minimum wage it pays drivers in France.

40,2023-12-25 18:05:24,TearRepresentative56,I'm a professional money manager and this is what I'm watching/ expecting for the week ahead.,"**Some Expectations:** * Low volume during the week due to Holiday season. * Nothing really on economic calendar this week at all + low volume = expectation of relatively flat movement. * No major headwinds so unlikely to see big correction this week, from a fundamental perspective. * Next real significant economic development will be the FOMC minutes on 3rd of Jan, and even that will probably send the dollar lower, pushing markets higher. So not expecting sustained correction in the very near term. * Likelihood is that any dips will be bought and market will remain around current levels for now. **A look at some of the Options data to reinforce these expectations:** * EURUSD Skew at highest level of the year. Traders continue to bet that EURUSD will breakout. I personally had 1.10 as a price target on EURUSD but the active 1.11 strike tells us traders want 1.11. [ The lack of data this week and risk reversal on DXY falling, pointing to continued drop in dollar means I won’t be surprised if 1.11 hits. * SPX skew is relatively flat. This tells us traders are not expecting a big move in either direction. Simply due to the fact of so little being on the economic calendar. Skew has lowered a bit, due to spike in VIX, but weak dollar means that volatility is not lasting in markets. Tells us dips are likely to be bought. [ * Slight weakness in DOW Skews vs SPX skews. More hedging activity there. So if there is likely to be any weakness, Dow will probably underperform other indexes. * Tesla EXPECTATIONS FROM Skews (just because I know the retail audience Loves Tesla): Bullish imbalance tells us sentiment is positive around Tesla. But the bullish skews lowered, so probably see some chop this week. May move higher after Year End. [ * NVDA EXPECTATIONS FROM SKEWS: 500 Gamma wall seems a strong resistance, unlikely to break in short term. * ***Fun fact, is the first time since 1997 that not a single company will report earnings during the last week of the year.*** **——— CALENDAR/ CATALYSTS ——** **MONDAY:** * The only thing I was watching today was my Yorkshire puddings, to make sure my brother in law didn’t steal them. * Ueda was talking earlier, with key highlights being that he said the prospect of achieving sufficient inflation rate isn’t enough yet and stressed the uncertainty involved. Said cannot predetermine when to raise policy. Most of this is already known to the market, so no real movement in USDJPY **TUESDAY: (Boxing Day, so bank holiday for many countries. Expected to see low volume):** * US House Price index - Will probably show a MOM change of around 0.8% imo. * US 2 year auction - Will probably send 2 year yields lower, with better than expected demand. **WEDNESDAY:** * JAPAN - BOJ will release their version of the fed minutes, from the meeting where they dovishly held rates stable, against expectations of a hike. My expectation is that this will probably send JPY lower as they reinforce their commitment to ultra easy. USDJPY to prop up * US - 5 year auction. Similar expectation to the 2 year auction the day before. **THURSDAY**: * JAPAN - Retail sales. * US - Jobless claims - Expectation for it to come out slightly under forecast, due to Holiday seasonality. **FRIDAY:** * SPAIN - inflation Rate preliminary reading for December. Significant as Spain CPI tends to be a leading indicator of Eurozone CPI.",4.5892017465293335

43,2024-01-18 12:03:37,BigBreadBreaka,Where Did I Go Wrong?,I took two shorts today on SPY. One right at open which is not normal for me( should’ve waited for a range or direction to be established) but I was focused on mainly that the higher time frame was pointing towards a bearish sentiment. I was also focused on a bullish dix correlating to a bearish market from my understanding. Then I scaled down onto a lower timeframe and waited for a fair value gap for my entry. Immediately after both trades I got stopped out before reversing down in which I would have hit my targeted take profit. From my understanding I should have maybe waited for a better entry and been more patient but from what I saw there wasn’t any better entry setups above my targeted entry. So where did I go wrong on this trade?,15.50976800976801

The company has already completed its scheduled deliveries to China for 2023, but the new restrictions could cause a ""permanent"" loss of opportunities for U.S. businesses in China Revenue guidance: Nvidia increased its fourth-quarter revenue guidance to $20 billion, but there was a ""whisper number"" on Wall Street that the company might miss its revenue targets.

49,2024-02-12 06:26:14,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is a complete report of everything I read and analysed from premarket 02/12 to inform your trading today.,"**Analysis**: * Today looks like a relatively light day in terms of macro releases and news. This is pretty much reflected in how flat premarket has been, around the levels it closed on Friday. * Let’s get into positioning then: * &#x200B; * On SPX, the call interest is surging on SPX at 5050 and 5100, following the break of 5000 on Friday. The market looks like it is extending the bets on the market going higher from here. The images below compare the option positioning on Thursday close vs Friday close. See a lot more developing over 5000. * [ * This chart shows all expirations. If we look at some near term expirations, we can see that the call resistance has rolled up to 5030. This is a bullish sign. We are not really seeing much activity here on the downside to suggest any worry of an immediate correction. * 5030 level looks like it could be a key level today, but watch the levels to watch section below [ the Gex is very positive right now. We are quite far above the HVL. This tells us that mosts likely, since we are in such positive gamma, the volatility will be suppressed today. * Skew is actually pointing slightly lower, but it’s no big deal, it’s just because futures are flat. block flows are very strong, and continue to increase. * Traders are starting to hedge the market, buying OTM puts, but the positioning still bullish, just increasingly cautious. * If we look at QQQ then, we had SPX hit 5k on Friday, but the market is still watching to see QQQ hit 440. That is a VERY sticky strike. We see a LOT of call interest on it, and IV OI. I’d expect it to hit this week, particularly if some of the macro data supports it. * We can see the positioning in the images below: * [ * Note that QQQ tracks Nasdaq (NDX), which is currently trading at 17,956. Watch 18k level. The market will probably face some resistance there and we will need to see stronger volume for it to break. 18k is also the Call resistance. So whilst you may watch QQQ, you should also be watching this level on NDX. * Look at one thing here: mag7 Skew. This is the skew but concentrated on just the Mag 7. * Moving higher again, at ATH. Traders don’t expect any issues for the big firms. Expected to carry the market higher. * Let’s take a look at some FX ahead of the week: * AS mentioned in the report yesterday, ahead of CPI, risk reversal in USD is pointing lower. Traders are not particularly concerned about the CPI and PPI and expect ti to come in soft or in line. * We can see this bearish divergence here, clearly. * [ * For individual currency pairs, EURUSD and GBPUSD, for both, risk reversal is pointing higher. * [ * A quick look at NVDa then, which is up again in premarket. * What we are seeing here is basically a continued squeeze. Skew points higher again, hits a new high. This comes as IV in OTM puts drop. BASically, bears keep trying to predict and short the pullback, but then as it moves higher, they continue to get squeezed and rush to cover their positions. This is moving NVDA higher in a parabolic way. If you are bearish on NVDA, it seems you need to just watch and wait rather than trying to guess the top. * [ **Levels to watch: (plot these on your charting platform as it will help you to analyse intraday price action).** * SPX currently trading at 5025. * One key level will be the 0dte Call resistance which is now at 5030. * Note the all expiration call resistance remains at 5000, which will create some support there. * Other key levels for gamma are 5050 and 5015. * My quant says the max trading range for today is 5059. * I doubt we hit that high, probs get stoped around 5030-5035. Let’s see * Quant says minimum of expected trading bound is 4994 ish. * QQQ: * Like I said, watch 18k level on NDX. This translated to around 438.4 on QQQ * Call resistance for QQQ is 440. I doubt we move higher than that today as there’s not much news. * Key gamma levels to watch are 435 and 437. * Quant says min of day trading range will be 433 and max of the day trading range is 441. I think we trade well within that range, as traders don’t want to make big moves before CPI. **DATA LEDE:** * Nothing particularly significant on the economic calendar for today. No big data releases. * We do have some fedspeak later, as Bowman speaks, as does Kashkari. * For the UK, Governor Bailey will be speaking. He probably reiterates the data driven approach for BoE and that its too early for cuts. After the last BoE meeting, markets trimmed bets on BOE rate cuts slightly, pricing 107 BPS in 2024, from 111 before. **INSTIUTITIONAL RESEARCH:** * An interesting piece here from Goldman Sachs: They have put out a note telling their clients to get out of parabolic tech. Said Everyone Is In The Same Trades And All-In”. Went ton to say that this is the Best Start Of The Year Ever For Momentum, But ""You Don't Want To Be On The Wrong Side During A Momentum Crash”. * A quote from a Goldman Sachs paper, where they compare the state of the stock market today, to the 2000 Dot com bubble: “At this point, valuations at the top are no where near as frothy as they were at the height of the Dot Com Bubble. The 5 largest stocks traded at 43x Fwd PE in March ‘00, a 59% premium to the Mag 7’s current multiple of 27x."" * We see this demonstrated in the table below: * [ * Bank of America say that they can see potential for the outperformance of small cap this year. They said that the factors that are supportive of this in 2024, include bottoming profits, historically attractive valuations (29% discount to large), improving market breadth, a Fed cutting cycle and inflecting macro indicators that are correlated with relative performance. * Global gold outflows continued in January, dragging Gold price lower, shows Bloomberg. **MARKETS:** * SPX: Closed Friday at 5026. In premarket, been trading in such a narrow range. Basically flat. * NASDAQ: Trading flat at 17,965. Watch the technical level of 18k today. Market will be trying to break it, may temporarily intraday, but this is the key level to watch as will need significant volume for Nasdaq to close above it. * DJI: Flat in premarket at 37,650. * GER40: Has been trying to break 17k level. Got a big push at 9am when market opened, right up to the 17k level. * Hong Kong Market closed for national holiday. * Chinese market slightly higher, trading at 11,430 * OIL: Got rejected at 77 on Friday. Trading slightly lower today, at 76. OIL IS SLIGHTLY LOWER Mostly as price correction from last week, but also AS ISRAEL SAYS IT HAD CONCLUDED A SERIES OF STRIEKS IN SOUTHERN GAZA, somewhat easing concerns of supply risk. Strikes continue in Gaza though, as Gaza officials say airstrikes kill 67. * Bonds: Opened higher today, then moved lower. **FOREX:** * JPY higher ahead of PPI later today. Risk reversal on JPY points lower. Traders are expecting that due to a hesitant BOJ to tighten, and no certainty on wage inflation, that JPY will underperform. * Dollar more or less stable right now, slightly higher, after got a bit of a push when European market opened. * EURUSD slightly lower, came to 1.08 then bounced down as found resistance and no big volume from the macro data to drive it higher. This was all technicals. * GBPUSD following lwoer. * AUDUSD opened slightly lwoer, then moved higher. * Not much news driving FX movement this morning. Just usual price action. * NZD lower on comments from NZRB governor who said that inflation ate was still too high at 4.7%. Whilst hawkish, there was some repricing, NZD has been up recently on expectations of RBNZ to hike again. **MAG 7 NEWs:** * AMZN - Jeff Bezos has sold $2b worth of Amazon Shares, his first sell since 2021. * TSLA - announced temporary model Y cuts in US until Feb 29th, less than a month after cutting prices of Model Y in Germany. * NVDA - building new business unit focused on designing custom chips for cloud computing firm san others, including advanced AI processors. * MSFT - has super bowl ad * AAPL - Wedbush says that apple supply chain checks show clear stabilisation of demand in China.

At this point, I’m considering just buying and holding this stock for a few months because I have completely disabled my bots from day trading NVDA. My prediction as of today 2/20/2024 is that NVDA will pop tomorrow (especially in the afternoon) and NVDA will absolutely crush analysts estimates tomorrow evening. I also anticipate them providing an extremely positive guidance/outlook and suspect we will see extreme volatility near and after the closing bell tomorrow.

53,2024-02-21 06:31:19,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket 02/21,"**ANALYSIS:** * Firstly, NVDA earnings are today. * Bloomberg is showing an 11% predicted volatility on earnings, as shown below. * [ * NVDA is lower in premarket on continued profit taking, but we can notice a few things. Firstly, skew, which was pointing sharply lower has now reversed upwards, as IV in OTM calls increases. 680 was a key gamma level where traders tried to buy the dip from yesterday. As we know earnigns are a risk. Earnigns when the stock is up 50% in the last quarter are an even bigger risk. We saw that in other earnings reports, like Google’s where good earnings were still punished based on valuation. * Bulls on NVDA are for the most part holding their positions. * This is the net gex profile for NVDA, skewed mostly to calls still on all expirations. * [ * On the 1 week to expirations, we can see more hedging for the earnigns. This clears up and the profile is again biased to calls when you look at monthly expirations. So traders hedge into earnings s that makes sense, but outlook still bullish. * [ * Key levels for NVDA are: * Call resistance at 700, although lots of calls on 750 too * Put support is at 640 * Put support from 0dte options is at 650 * These will be key levels going into the earnigns print. —— * China points higher today as markets react to the cutting of 5 year rate yesterday. We noted on weekend that it seemed skew for Hong Kong was pointing higher and we could see calls building on 17k. It seems that traders are still expecting 17k to hit. A look at Oil: * Spot price falls at the moment, as volatility continues as traders buy ATM puts to hedge for volatility. * However, we can see from skew that there is a bullish divergence there on Brent. * [ * Volatility continues due to the hedging and the evercahgning geopolitical landscape, as well as ever changing Fed expectations. * But overall, outlook still looks bullish. A look at BTC\\ * Looks like we can be seeing a local top here. IV in OTM calls is reducing, block trade flows also reduce. Skew points lower. May see some correction. A quick look at indices then: * Volatility skew does point down as traders hedging with put options, but money flows from hedge funds hit new high yesterday. Funds are buying the dip, and not expecting it to last in medium term. A lot in the short term will depend on NVDA though. * Finally, if we look at Mag7 skew, we do see signs that market can continue to price correct. * We see Mag7 skew lower, which often leads the market. Traders are seeking some protection from the volatility in short term. **DATA LEDE:** * KEY IS FOMC MINUTES WHICH IS RELEASED 2 HOURS BEFORE MARKET CLOSE. * Japan tankan business survey gives first negative reading on business sentiment since April 2023. * Japan Balance of Trade Numbers: * Overall balance of trade was less negative than expected. * Exports grew more than expected up 12% YOY, ahead of expectations of 9.5% * Imports fell more than expected, by 9.6% vs 8.4% expected. * This means more exports and less imports, points to greater demand for JPY.

The second chart is the NVDA 5-minute chart, on the day of earnings. I am predicting an inside-ish day on NVDA, which could be great for scalpers/day traders. I will avoid the earnings release, as that's gambling IMO. But I will look to trade a smaller size once it settles after hours. Levels-wise, I will be watching the $750 on the upside; after that, we have no levels to look at. Downside $670",3.0612244897959187

59,2024-03-06 05:40:37,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing from premarket after market sold off yesterday,"**ANALYSIS:** * We do have a few volatile events today. Firstly the ADP jobs numbers, which are expected to come in hotter than last month, whilst Powell talks in his testimony infant of Congress. * I think Powell’s talk will be important, but probably not the impact some may fear, as if you look historically at when Powell testifies, not as much movement as other speeches by Powell. Only thing I worry about is the fact that inflation ticked higher last month and could tick higher again this month if you look at Euro inflation reports for Feb as a guide. This could make Powel more hawkish than before. Still, Powell is generally v candid with his words so I’m not sure he will say anything which kills the market, but let’s see. * Regardless, if we look at risk reversal on DXY, we see it widen as traders continue to expect dollar to fall in medium term. * Traders are mostly long GBPUSD, and very short USDJPY. LEt’s see. * EURUSD they are long as well, but less so. Let’s see. Moving towards 1.09 which is trader target but may see rejection there. * Regarding price movement yesterday, we saw a squeeze as traders very short volatility, which was triggered by bad news around TESla and AAPl. * This moved VIX much higher to 15, which led to QQQ sell off. * Was. Bigger sell off than I anticipated, but signs of a major pullback still not there. * Traders still very short vol, and we saw them sell it off towards end of the day, and today, VIX is lwoer at 14. * Yesterday was likely a buying opportunity rather than a major negative event. * We can get volatility from JOLTS today, they tend to be volatile for the market, but still no major signs of pullback. * Institutional money flow on SPY not pulling back one bit. THeyre still long. * On oil we can expect a bit more sideways movement below 80, as volatility skew quite flat, but I think fundamentals support move back to 80 on WTI as producers look to extend cuts to supply. DATA LEDE: * South Korea Inflation rate comes hot, at 3.1% vs 2.9% expected. Above previous reading of 2.8% * MOM was hot 0.5% vs 0.4% expected * Aus GDP (Q4) - Comes stronger than expected, at 1.5% YOY growth rate, vs 1.4% expected. Previous reading was 2.1% * So it slowed vs last month, but beat expectations. * GERMAN exports and imports both beat expectation * Exports MOM came 6.3% Up, vs expectations of 1.5% increase * Imports were 3.6% up, vs expectations of 1.8% increase * This points to improving domestic demand and international demand, although is one data point. * Eurozone Retail Sales (Jan) * Retail sales were down 1% YOY, better than expectations of a -1.3% decline. * MOM retail sales were more or less in line. * So still declining YOY. This has been the case for more than a year. Not great, but in line with expectations. * ADP Employment Chnge (Feb) - Expected to have grown to 150k jobs placed according to official consensus. * POWELL TESTIMONY * JOLTS (Jan) - has been a volatile one for market reaction for intraday trading, so look out for this one. ———— MARKETS: * SPX: pushing up towards 5100 again in premarket, low yday of 5058, after falling from 5110 * NASDAQ: back Abvoe 18k again, this will be the key level for it to maintain. * Hong Kong MARKET pumps on PBOC pointing to more room to cut interest rates. Was up 2%, faded the gain a little bit though later in session. * China downs slightly, couldn’t maintain the break above 12k. That remains the key level. * GEr40: Slightly higher today although not by much, as markets await ECB decision tomorrow * FTSE100 - higher by 0.51%. Traders look more bullish with the positive catalyst of hopefully a supportive budget, but we have to see. * OIL - slightly higher, on tight supply, as many oil producing companies signal that they will be reducing supply. Also dollar lower. * GOLD - higher again, conintues to march up as USD pulls back. FX: * AUD higher on Australia growth numbers coming in better than expected, and also on the fact that China signal more rate cuts possible ahead. * Dollar down slightly ahead of ADP and Powell testimony, testimony will be key for dollar direction today * JPY higher as report that BOJ is apparently more confident now though about stronger wage growth. * GBP slightly higher, awaiting UK budget. * AUDUSD: was trading around 0.65, but has sustained a move higher today on PBOC news * GBPUSD at 1.272, above 1.27 ahead of Budget * EURUSD pushes towards 1.09. * USDJPY back below 150. **EARNINGS:** **CRWD** * CURRENT QUARTER: * Revenue of 945M beat by 12% * Operating income of 213M beat by 13% * Operating margin was 22.5% beat vs 22.4% expectation * EPS of 0.95 beat by 15% * FCF was strong, beat by 4.8% * ARR beat by 1.3%.

Made back all of my losses mainly through NVDA calls in the past few months.

68,2024-03-20 05:16:32,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket ahead of FOMC meeting today.,"**ANALYSIS:** * Yesterday, we saw an early dip in the equity markets as SPX touched 5123, and QQQ touched 433. * However, as mentioned in the premarket report and continually mentioned in my commentaries, traders remain incredibly short volatility. * AS such, that created the usual vix crush as we see here, with VIX dropping below 13. * [ * This fuelled market makers to add liquidity, which led to the usual intraday recovery back to 5180 and 438.5. * Today, we have the FOMC meeting which will be the key focus, as will the updated dot plot which will be released. * We are seeing low volume in options ahead of this, as traders are basically waiting for it. * On January and February CPI coming in ahead of expectations, and with Shelter and Core inflation remaining very sticky, there is some likely expectation that Powell will be less dovish. * I think that’s probably true, he will be more hawkish, but it appears traders are not expecting him to be outright hawkish as such. * Probably more neutral, pointing to the fact that inflation is coming down, and will affirm their intention to continue bringing inflation down. He will probably continue to say that they just need to see more of the same before moving to cutting. More of the usual data dependence commentary, but with hints that cuts will still be on the table. * Credit Default swaps don’t show any signs of major alarm, and continue to head lower. * [ * Traders are hedging into today’s meeting. Dollar is increasing in premarket. Nonetheless, traders remain very short volatility still. Inflation swaps are still pricing inflation to come down later in the year, even if it appears that it is stuck for now. * I think that off the back of this, we do probably see dollar increase, hence why I haven’t averaged my positions against USD today and averaged with very little size yesterday. Looking at the equity market, we probably see some volatility, and a dip, but vol will probably crush again, so any VIX spike probably won’t last long, which should again fuel market makers to add liquidity to aid the recovery (not necessarily same day recovery, but short term nonetheless). * On next monthly expiry, we have seen 5300 accumulate gex quite a bit recently, so traders are still looking higher, but hedge for some volatility. * As mentioned previously, we can see traders open puts inr response to a possible hawkish Powell, and then get squeezed again and forced to short cover, as we have seen repeatedly over the course of this rally, and as we saw on Monday. Shorting probably not the way forward as traders are still bullish on medium expiries. **DATA LEDE** * China maintain their loan prime rate for 1 year and 5 year at current rates * UK INFLATION * Core inflation falls to 4.5%, below estimates of 4.6%. Previous reading was 5.1%, where it was stuck for the last 3 months. * Headline inflation came 3.4%, below estimates fo 3.5% and down from 4% where it was for last 3 months. * Largest downward contributions came from food, restaurants and cafes. * Biggest upward contributions came form housing and motor fuels. * This is an encouraging print, pointing to possible dovish BOE. Following the print, futures now point to 71 bps of BoE cuts by year end, vs 67bps before the print. * EIA Crude Stock Data * Of course, the main focus of today is the Fed decision, and Powell’s press conference. * Dot plot will be released with the report. Could show we have taken another cut out of there. ————— **MARKETS:** * SPX: Yesterday, we saw early dip to 5125 level, before big push higher to close at 5180.

69,2024-03-20 17:29:17,T1m3Wizard,I was told to post my positions here after asking why my margin balance was showing -$46k yesterday. Hopefully someone can help and this can add some insight with this to yesterday's post?,"Here is my [post/question]( from yesterday. For context, aside from using this account to occasionally day trade I also use it to short options as well.",0.0
70,2024-03-21 17:16:12,T1m3Wizard,Started trading 5 years ago with 36k after saving up from my first job out of college. These are the lessons I learned along the way (in no particular order) that I hope can benefit other aspiring traders.,"Preface: I only funded this account with the starting capital of 36k and had never added to it. This was supposed to be my go ham with real money live trading account so I can feel the real emotions involved instead of a painless simulated trading experience/practice (probably not recommended). Perhaps I got lucky but I am surprised it survived as well and grew so steadily. This account has evolved from buying and holding to day trading stocks and options, and is currently in the premium selling phase for the last 3.5 years. Methods changed and evolved but the below is true and should remain consistent as you still need to analyze the chart before jumping in. I decided to do a write up in hopes of helping others because I asked a question the other day since I started using my broker's mobile app and was perplexed about the way it displayed it's margin balance and boy did I get chewed up 😄. To be fair there were some helpful comments but it was extremely rare. I don't want others to be discouraged and think this sub is unhelpful to hopefully someone finds these suggestions helpful. Here were my list two posts and the comments I received if you are curious: [Why is my margin balance showing -46k?]( / [Positions]( 1. Psychology plays a big role. 2. Don't trade with money you can't afford to lose. 3. Trade with the trend. 4. Pick stocks with relative strength or relative weakness. 5. You can measure a stock's RSRW against SPY and/or it's sector. 6. There is a STEEP learning curve. 7. Journal and review your trades. 8. Although Indicators are subjective, if there are enough people watching or using it, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy so always be mindful of where buyers and sellers are eyeing. 9. If a stock is strongly supported or sold off at one area or price point, it will most likely create a temporary top or bottom as buyers/sellers were rewarded there once before so you can expect them to react the same way. 10. Unless you're yolo'ing or gambling, don't trade around earnings or any major news event as these can create a catalyst and are very unpredictable. 11. Gaps tend to be filled. 12. Day 2 and plus continuation is a real thing if there is a strong enough catalyst (e.g. gap and go) 13. Institutions move markets. 14. Volume is important. 15. Don't chase loses. 16. IV is high for a reason. 17. Know your greeks if are going to trade options. 18. Use a top down approach such as multi time frame analysis and start with the higher time frames. 19. Buy and hold trumps all (unpopular opinion for day traders but it's true). 20. Try not to trade during the first and last 30 to 60 mins of market open/close. 21. There are opportunities throughout the day 22. Know and develop your own trading style and do what works best for you. 23. Risk management is important but I do not follow the regurgitated 1% rule (it's regarded if you have enough buying power and margin at your disposal). 24. Use margin wisely. 25. Learn to adapt to different market conditions. 26. What has worked in the past might now work in the future if macro economics changed. 27. Never stop learning. 28. Past performance is not indicative of future results. That's it for now mainly because I'm tired and don't want to type anymore, I'm sure there's more. Will come back later and add to the list perhaps. Good luck everyone!",16.28329124579124

73,2024-03-26 15:51:18,ShittyStockPicker,"For me, learning to trade has been a series of lightbulbs I turn on to get further down a dark hallway, rather than one switch I turn on that lights the whole building. Here's a lightbulb I turned on a couple years ago","I remember this so clearly now. This was the Summer before the infamous October low. We were just off the highs of the June Low of 2022. (The June low of 2022 was also a key moment of my trading career, I'll have to leave that one for a different day.) I could see in the charts that we were primed for a solid run up on $SPY. But still, there was so much to be bearish about. Interest rates were still going up in the Summer of 2022, inflation was still high, gas prices were still outrageous, and we were all still certain we were about to fall into a pit of depression at any moment both emotionally and economically. But still, like an enthusiastic elevator operator the charts were screaming at me ""Going up!"". It was at this point I learned to trust the trust and my ability to listen to what they were telling me. So, in an act of what was faith at the time, I bought the calls. Oh, and did we ever go up! It was one of those exciting months where my swing trades just went further in the money and I was constantly rolling them, I was buying every dip in sight on an intraday basis. I rode the wave all the way from about $385 to $410. Then I got scared. I started to say ""This isn't rational, we're in a bear market. The shorts have been reset. We have Jackson Hole coming up and JPOW is gonna hammer the market. There's still too much inflation he doesn't want the wealth effect!"" I sold, right on the verge of making a killing I sold. Had I rolled those calls up one more time I would have had an opportunity to be a much wealthier man. But I sold. I watched SPY march all the way to nearly $430. Wow. I knew it was irrational. I knew it was dumb for the market to do that. After some hurting, and after some soreness at not letting my winners run I had what I regard to be one of the most important lightbulb moments in my trading career. Jesse LIvermore once said ""A man has to have experience, and he must pay for it."" Did I ever pay for it! Here's what the experience I paid for: **I'd rather bet on the market doing something more irrational than it already has than bet that the market will come to it's senses.** &#x200B; **Epilogue** There was some guy on /r/WallStreetBets who posted about $NVDA being a bubble somewhere around $250. He said something along the lines of ""What, so we're just going to buy this stock all the way up to $500?"" I responded back, ""Why not $500""?"" He sarcastically said, ""How about $750?"" ""I said, why not a $1,000?"" Only difference between him and I is that he thought I was in on his joke. No. I knew that if there was any stock that was going to do something irrational in 2023 is was NVDA. I was free. Free of thinking about stocks rationally. Free of trying to apply logic and reason to something that is guided by ignorance, fear, greed and hope. I was, in a way, trying to lead him to the place that I'm in now. &#x200B;",13.553030303030303
74,2024-03-27 04:46:56,TearRepresentative56,I'm a full time news driven trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket 27/03,"**ANALYSIS:** * Yesterday we saw SPX trading extremely rangebound all day, from 5225 to 5234, until the end of the day, when in the last 45 minutes, we saw 3 big red candlesticks, and SPX suddenly closed at 5203. * We see that here below: * [ * Now the short of it, is that NVDA sold off from 950 to 925 at the end of the day yesterday, which dragged the market with it. However, that's not really the full explanation. Why did NVDA sell off like that and what was the market mechanism behind it? * To understand that, let's fully understand what we mean when we talk about skew. Skew tracks the ratio of the IV of Calls to the IV of Puts to give us an indication of trader sentiment. It's a very useful indicator. * What does it mean when skew is lowering, as we see happening in NVDA over last few days: * [ * When Skew is lowering, it means that either the IV of calls is decreasing, or the IV in puts is increasing. * Because IV in calls was reducing in this case, it implied some short term downward pressure as it means that traders are lowering their exposure to the stock. In this case, because IV in call options OTM was lowering, but traders remain short vol, This meant market makers removed liquidity at the end of the day to hedge, once NVDA started dropping. When market makers remove liquidity, thats when we see downward movement. * This is what accelerated the sell off EOD to being a bit of a flush out. * Now is it a problem? * Not really. Traders remain very short vol. We saw vix jump, but it has now since sold off the gains pretty much. Because VIX remained low and is being shorted the shit out of, once it started to drop, market makers bought the dip again, and we see that in premarket we are back to 5225. * [ * Regarding NVDA, positioning overall is bullish. But we do see IV in call options continue to lwoer as we see traders selling calls. This we can attribute to profit taking as not seeing massive OTM put gamma. * Gamma wall at 900 is still the support, and one at 920 before that and 950 has v high Delta on it so that's the wall to break to move higher towards 1000. Target in med term is still 1000 as positioning still bullish but with skew pointing lower towards profit taking we can see bit of volatility in the low 900 range. * Oil we saw headed lower as skew was pointing lwoer as was the crack spreads, but it holds the 80 level. Staying above 80 WTI is key as it will maintain the bullishness and liquidity. Below this we can see further volatility increase. * Gold positioning extremely bullish. * Markets are still v bullish. Not much signs of stress in the market. Just look at the European markets. GER40 is flying, every day just keeps increasing. This is a clear sign that markets are seeing low stress. * Traders continue to be very short volatility. This means that any VIX spikes we do get are likely to be sold off quickly as market makers will increase liquidity. This makes it much more likely for dips to be bought quickly. * I don’t see much cause for concern on PCE, yes we can see dollar increase from FX side, but traders in equity market are pricing hotter inflation in near term before it levels out in the longer term. That’s probably what we will see. * Chinese market looks volatile, that’s the only thing, but has strong support at 16k. **DATA LEDE:** * 01:30 Australia CPI index: Came in line with last month, slightly below the expectations for it to tick up slightly from 3.4% to 3.5% * Came in at 3.4% YOY * Spain inflation rate preliminary reading for March: * YOY at 3.2% in line with expectations, slightly higher than 2.8% last month * MOM comes slightly hot at 0.8%, vs forecast of 0.6% * Note core came in lower than expected. * This isn’t really surprising. Forward inflation swaps in US is already pricing in a hot CPI next month for US, so we expect similar in Europe. * 10:00 Eurozone Economic Sentiment (Mar) * Comes in line with expectations at 96.3. Improved economic sentiment vs last month, as hopes of ECB rate cut rise. * 11:00 US MBA Mortgage Apps * 23:50 BOJ Summary of Opinions from BOJ meeting - expect more dovishness after their first hike in a decade was v dovish. ————— **MARKETS:** * SPX: Recovered after yesterdays little end of day sell off, which took us to 5203. Almost imemdiate recovery as VIX got crushed again, and fuelled further by European session. * NDX: Similar picture, dropped to 18200 yesterday, but now recovered back to 18,308 * DJI: Trading at 39500. Pushing up slightly in premarket. * GER40: Approaches 18500, up 0.6% again today. * Hong Kong market down 1%, trading at 16400. Has been unable to recover the uptrend which it dropped out of since this week. Trading quite flat. Support is at 16000. Skew points more negative so can see more pressure. * CHINA50: consolidating around the 12k level. Very sideways movement this month. Also down, but less so than HKG * JPN225 was higher initially as yen fell but then lowered as we saw Yen recover on FX intervention talks. * OIL: Lower, back at near 80. Holds this level and pushes slightly higher. * GOLD: Higher again, up 0.95% back to 2200. Bullishness on gold remains very strong in the positioning data. **INSTITUTIONAL:** * It’s quarter end and pensions funds may need to sell roughly $22 billion in global stocks and buy $17 billion of fixed income in order to return to prior asset allocation levels, according to an earlier estimate from Morgan Stanley. **FX:** * Swiss franc lower despite positive survey data from the ZEW survey. Showed that Swiss investors are optimistic about the economic outlook.

84,2024-05-22 05:03:19,TearRepresentative56,"I'm a full time trader and this is my total pre market cheat sheet, including positioning analysis on US markets, NVDA, TSLA and FX. ","ANALYSIS: Overall US Market: * SPX Skew is elevated, traders remain bullish. Skew points slightly down, but this is hedging ahead of FOMC. Traders selling some calls but its v low volume. * Note: positioning and trader sentiment around NVDA remains bullish. * Because of this positive expectation around NVDA, traders are buying calls on QQQ. Traders expect Nasdaq rot continue to go higher. * So we do see some disparity there in what traders are doing. They are more bullish on tech right now ahead of NVDA. * Momentum continues to show stronger buyers, we are at ATH on both QQQ and SPX. * MSFT and NFLX both hit new highs yesterday. * VIX liquidity continues to be very low, whilst liquidity in equities is increasing. The fact that VIX liquidity is very low is a sign that traders have no real fear in the market. Bulls v comfortable right now. On FX & metals: * As mentioned in other post, GBPUSD positioning bullish, particularly after CPI came hotter than expected. Short term and long term we see skew point up. 1.28 target. on EURUSD, skew points higher but price is stuck below 1.085 for now. 1.08 is clear support, traders target 1.09, even calls on 1.10. * On Gold and Silver, we can see a slight pullback or flattening whilst traders wait to see more volume. V low volume but mostly traders selling their calls now and buying puts. Still low volumes though so not expecting big moves. But also not seeing big move higher yet. Key stocks for focus: * **NVDA: skew is flattish this week but pointing higher. Traders will be looking for 1000 if earnings come in in line. More if stock split. A lot of calls around there. As a result of NVDA earnings looking higher, SMCI higher too. Other semis in general quite bullish on hopeful expectations for NVDA.** * **TSLA: Got bit of a jump yday as skew pointed higher and we got good news to support. Gamma is mostly between 180-190. Can see move to 190 if NVDA supports, but beyond that not much OTM call gamma. Positioning iTM is strong but not seeing move higher. More likely possible rejection from 100D MA.** DATA LEDE: * UK CPI: Headline came out 2.3% vs 2.1% expected. Still down a lot on the 3.2% last month. Hot, but not that bad. * But if we look under the hood, we see that there are areas of the UK inflation that are heating up. * Core CPI came 3.9% vs 3.6% expected. Only down slightly from 4.2% * And if we look at Services in particular, we see Services inflation at 5.9%, much hotter than the 5.4% expected and more or less sticky to last month. * BOE have been more dovish/neutral recently * This increases risk of moving more hawkish again. * Now traders see just 38bps of rate cuts in 2024 after the data, much less than before. * RBNZ hawkish pause. * FOMC minutes later. MARKETS: * SPX: Flat at 5317. Bounced off high of 5325 again, same as last couple of days. Market will likely remain flat ahead of NVDA earnings and FOMC. WAS A RECORD CLOSE YDAY * NDX: At record highs. 18,730. 1.5% away from 19k, so can be in view if nVDA earnings come good * Dow: Flat just under 40k * GER40: Slightly lower this morning, all just normal profit taking and hedging at these highs, positioning remains bullish. * HKG50: Flat at 19,202 today, absolutely flat * OIL: slightly lwoer again. Mostly flat around 78. Was rejected at 80 WTI * Gold slightly lower today, at 2413. Support still 2400. FX: * USD moving slightly higher again, paring some of the post CPI losses. With this, USDJPY continues higher, as yen remains weak after failed intervention. Failed to break 152, hence moving higher. * EURUSD stuck just under 1.285, bullish positioning. * GBPUSD at 1.272. Target looks like 1.28 especially given CPI hot. EARNINGS: TGT: * dropping hard on miss on guidance by 2%. EPS fell short.

92,2024-05-30 14:32:09,jabberw0ckee,Tip of the Day 2024-05-30,"I plan to post tips and advice periodically for new stock day traders. I trade stock and nothing else. **What's Important For Day Traders** 1. The stocks you trade 2. Your knowledge of intraday market behavior 3. Your knowledge of general market behavior and things that affect it 4. Having a good overall strategy 5. Having the funds $$ that match your strategy 6. Mastering your emotions and psychology 7. Technicals I'm currently on day 26 of a personal challenge and here is my progress and the stocks I traded today: 1. The Stocks You Trade This is my top piece of advice for Day Trading - Research and Trade the Best Stocks They Rise More Than They Fall Well above emotion, psychology, and even technicals, I rank your stocks as the number one item that can improve your game. I trade with a list of 20-30 stocks that I research, monitor, and track on a daily basis. I choose stocks with strong fundamentals that have Buy and Strong Buy ratings (Rarely Hold or Sell), Price Targets that are above current price, and higher beta (usually above 1.25). Choosing stocks with good fundamentals increases the odds that your stocks will be trending up more often than down. I combine swing trading with my day trading and if any of my day traded stocks go south on me, I wait for it to rise again. If you're trading good stocks this happens more often than not and usually quite quickly. Liquidity Another important aspect of the stock you pick is liquidity. Some stocks have considerably higher volume than other stocks on a daily basis. Others have high volume and volatility on certain days - usually because of news, upcoming earnings releases, etc. Day Traders should be trading in these highly liquid arenas because you are buying and selling stock several times a day. You need buyers and sellers to make this happen. Learn to recognize the difference. I sometimes open the chart of a stock that's on my list and swear I hear crickets - low volume, choppy candlesticks, market looks closed for this stock. When this happens, I don't trade that stock. If you buy shares, there won't be anyone there to take it off your hands. Look for volume. Momentum I tend to pick stocks that are part of a group momentum play. I'm currently trading a lot of AI stocks and companies that are related to the AI play. AI is in momentum. AI is the next industrial revolution. Some call it hype, but it's not just hype. AI will improve the revenue, reduce expenses, and increase profits for companies who utilize AI, and every company will have to implement AI to stay competitive. NVDA has 90% market share for AI chips which means almost all companies will be sending money to NVDA. What do these companies do with these chips? They implement racks and racks of servers, ethernet switches, power supplies, cables, transceivers, etc for their AI clusters. They also implement software. And they'll need electricity which is in short supply unless it's solar. The point is, expect all these related industries to also benefit from AI. Trade the momentum as all these stocks are doing well. Manage Your List of Stocks Don't just make a list of stocks and only trade those stocks. Your list should be dynamic. It changes based on market conditions, the health of the companies on your list and because other stocks get hot. Today I traded CAVA, a restaurant stock because it's currently hot and is often called the next Chipotle. I also look for times to buy good, trending stocks. For example, today, because of SalesForce, other software stocks dropped in sympathy, along with SalesForce. I see this as an opportunity to buy other software companies that are affected by the SaleForce drop but otherwise are very strong stocks. So, I bought a big position in CRWD which has 48 Buy ratings, 1 hold rating, and 0 sell ratings. It also has a price target of $400 and it closed today at $315.92, down $33.60 because of SalesForce. I expect CRWD to rise next week prior to earnings. Conclusion Whether you have good technicals or not. Whether you can control your emotions or not. Whether you understand intraday market patterns or not, you will always benefit from trading great stock with good fundamentals that analysts agree are a Buy or Strong Buy, have good price targets above their current price and have good beta so there's a reasonable amount of volatility. All these things are good for day traders.",17.473528036908313

Don’t overtrade. Well, I decided to start in on some $NVDA puts after the 1200 break out. I took more size than I should have. I got smoked. I gave back all gains and ended the day -1,400. Then I had the smart idea to take 2 option contracts of $NVDA 1250 puts expiring June 14 at $58.00. Well. I’m starting in the hole tomorrow on these most likely over 1,000 I’d guess probably closer to -2,000. My +2,000 day will now be a -3,500 day because I’m a fucking idiot. So pissed. So upset with myself. Despair. Maybe this isn’t for me if I can control my overtrading.",16.26984126984127
95,2024-06-05 17:11:12,Lavanger,"Made 30%, could have made 300%. How do you guys deal with profit taking?","Alright hear me out, I been planning this week since Sunday night, watch some news, what to expect from the week, take some notes, put some stocks on my watch list, set up ranges, look up a an economic calendar and see what catalyst we have this week etc. Well this week for all you regards it's all around PMI reports and Job reports, sure some foreign banks playing with interest rates, but we don't care about that really, unless you trade Futures or Forex (I don't), I trade US equities we don't care about ECB lowering rates. Earnings season almost over, and although weak, not bad. Monday and Tuesday reports pointing to a weak report on Friday, and today was like a confirmation, NVDA doing split on Friday, perfect, we go long. Without even looking at charts, just the ADP report I knew we were in for a 2% day movement. Well it's 9:45 and QQQ is already up 1%... should I go long, I mean it's already high enough.. Well, of course, like I said trend days like this tend to be 2% days on average. (For QQQ) I see it starts a breakout I go long as soon as it starts, no fear. I buy 20 contracts, 0dte QQQ. Long story short, I sold at 1.25% lol , made $620 instead of $6200. Obviously I was checking the chart every 2 minutes after I sold and was pissed I myself, now I am more calm because nobody goes broke taking profit, and I know I did good... But this is something that always happens to me, I sell and I keep looking at the charts. Only time I'm happy is when I sell for a loss and then it dips further, I'm relived lol But we all know that's not good, if you put emotions you end up taking more trades etc. How do you guys deal with it? any recommendations? Trust me I close the chart only to open it every 5 minutes.",16.40833333333333

Not even a couple months later NVDA started sky rocketing and carrying the 2024 market (Currently at 1200). Fast forward to last Friday I got GME at $23.03 a share with 43 shares. The following Monday GameStop rose to $38 a share so I coulda sold Monday morning and made an extra 700. But since I slept in I ended up selling for $280 profit. Now GME is at $55, excluding the profit I sold it for I fumbled 800 today. Now I feel like shit why do I keep doing this to myself how do I prevent this? It’s really eating at me I feel absolutely dead. I know these might be rookie numbers for some people but I’m 17 and my account is valued at 1300 with these GME shares I could have made my profit goal for the entire summer (which was to double my account). Long story short I missed 3 opportunities to double my account to around 2000 one on NVDA and twice in one week on GME how do I stop being an idiot? How can I prevent this in the future? I get it’s part of trading and I need to turn off my emotions but I need actual advice I just feel really dead inside and stupid",-5.952380952380952
98,2024-06-11 05:47:51,TearRepresentative56,"Im a full time catalyst driven trader and this is my pre market cheat sheet, including all the news, all the updates from WWDC, and all my expectations for the day based on the option data. ","ANALYSIS: * Market continues to be in a wait and see mode before CPI and FOMC. * It is a Stable market in positive gamma, so not expecting much volatility unless something extremely unexpected happens. Positioning is bearish on VIX and market makers will be trying to keep a lid on volatility. * Base case is more chop and range bound before FOMC. * Skew for SPX is lower. This is because there is some hedging on the option chain, but not much. Less than usual for an event like this. Traders expect CPI to come soft, as oil prices have been in decline in May, so headline should follow. * We can see that the market is basically pricing in for there to be a VIX crush tomorrow, which is supportive for the markets. * 5350 still he pivot. Bears will try to get below 5340 where bearish flows will increase. * Bulls will try to get above 5375. There is strong gamma at 5375. * 5340 can be a magnet, but let’s see. Probably more range bound as I mentioned. * NVDA positioning still looks bullish. Many were expecting a sell the news after the stock split, but we aren’t seeing this in the data right now to be honest. DATA LEDE * UK employment data comes weak * We have a worst of both worlds type situation going on in the UK labour market - stagflationary even. * Employment numbers came in at -139k, much worse than the -100k expected. SO market were expecting job loss, but the job loss was more extreme than anticipated. * Less negative than last couple of months though. * Unemployment rate ticked up to yearly high 4.4% * All of that is not bad, as it signals weakening in labour market that is a sign BOE can cut. * But the Average earnings also came in hotter than expected, at 5.9% vs 5.7% expected. Still near the lows though. * But this is what scared the FTSE. The hot earnings numbers may make it harder for BOE to cut, but the employment numbers suggest they need to. * Will call for continued caution overall. * 10Y Note auction today * CPI and FOMC tomorrow. MARKETS: * SPX: Flat around that pivot of 5350 again. Last few days have bene very low volatility, very flat as traders wait for the FOMC meeting. * Nasdaq: Flat at 19k this morning, 19k acting as support for now. * Dow Jones: Flat at 38700, positioning bullish. Can see move above 39k tomorrow or later this week. * FTSE: Falling after employment data shows average earnings higher. THIs puts spanner in the works for BOE for rate cuts. * HKG50: lower this morning, bounced off 18k today. 18k is support. * VIX: Slightly higher, above 13, but positioning is still very short on volatility, so we can expect it to get crushed lower again. * OIL: slightly lower after bouncing off 78 yesterday. FX: * EurUSD hits 1 month low at 1.073. Support is at 1.07 GBPUSD slightly higher, more or less flat, as employment data suggests that BOE can’t cut so soon, hence hawkish. * USDJPY slightly higher at 157 AAPL - WWDC takeaways: * Unveiled Apple intelligence - new AI initiative emphasising privacy and personalisation. * OpenAI partnership - Siri will leverage ChatGPT allowing users to interact with AI for various tasks including for instance creating bedtime stories with images. * Custom AI emojis * IO18 updates: * New text message effects, tap to cash (secure method to pay person by holding phones together), Home Screen customisations. * iPad OS 18: * Introducing native calculator app with unit conversions, Shareplay enhancements * MAcOS: * iPhone mirroring, control iPhone from Mac even when locked, new passwords app. MAG 7: * AAPL - Reiterated Apple’s underweight rating, price target of 164. Said that WWDC brought no positive surprises. Said apple’s software and support from developers is good, but no catalyst from stock perspective, as no new hardware was announced. Software features are not meaningful. Said the ChatGPT integration is not much better than Siri these days. * AAPL - meanwhile, DA Davidson upgraded to buy from neutral, raising price target to 230 from 200. Said yesterdays announcement reminds them of the transition from Npaster to iTunes. Siad it will drive much broader adoption of AI than seen to date as SIRI will be able to execute tasks on behalf of the user. * AAPL - Musk says that if Apple integrates OPenAI at the OS level, then apple devices will be banned at Musk’s companies.

Says NVDA is best positioned in AI, benefiting from their full stack Ai hardware, networking and software solutions. Raised 2024 and 2025 earnings estimate. * NVDA - potential Dow inclusion speculation. * MSFT - OpenAI hires new CFO, product chief and partners with Apple for ChatGPT integration. * GOOGL - MS says that google search is unlikely to be disrupted by Apple’s GEnAI use cases.

This will have impact on US shipping stocks. One reason is possible ceasefire between Israel and Hamas which reduces geopolitical risk to shipping, hence lower prices. * Can also be because Balitmore shipping channel fully reopens after bridge collapse, hence less shipping disruption and therefore lower shipping prices. * China says they won’t sit idly by if EU takes actions on EVs.

99,2024-06-11 20:09:30,Outrageous_Bid5910,Thoughts on nvda,"### High Demand for NVIDIA's GPUs #### Key Drivers of Demand 1. **Product Development and Computational Tasks**: - **Chatbots and AI**: Companies use GPUs to power AI models for chatbots, virtual assistants, and other natural language processing (NLP) applications. The computational power of GPUs is essential for training and running these models efficiently. - **Scientific Research**: High-performance computing (HPC) tasks in scientific research, such as simulations and data analysis, heavily rely on GPUs for their parallel processing capabilities. 2. **Self-Driving Technology**: - **Autonomous Vehicles**: GPUs are critical in processing the vast amounts of data from sensors and cameras in real-time to make decisions for self-driving cars. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and others invest heavily in GPU technology for their autonomous vehicle programs. 3. **Robotics**: - **Industrial Automation**: Robotics in manufacturing and logistics use GPUs to handle complex tasks, including real-time image recognition, object manipulation, and path planning. - **Service Robots**: From healthcare to hospitality, service robots rely on GPU-powered AI to interact with humans and perform tasks autonomously. 4. **Race Towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**: - **Major Tech Companies**: Companies like Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft are in a race to develop AGI. This requires building and training extremely large neural networks, which demand substantial computational resources provided by GPUs. - **Market Advantage**: The first company to achieve AGI could gain a significant market advantage, driving intense competition and further increasing the demand for high-performance GPUs. ### Implications for NVIDIA #### Market Position - **Leadership in GPU Technology**: NVIDIA is a leader in the GPU market, known for its continuous innovation and high-performance products. This positions NVIDIA well to meet the growing demand across various sectors. - **R&D Investment**: NVIDIA’s investment in research and development ensures it stays ahead of competitors and continues to deliver cutting-edge GPU solutions. #### Potential for Growth - **Revenue Increase**: The diverse and expanding applications of GPUs suggest sustained and potentially increasing revenue streams for NVIDIA. - **Strategic Partnerships**: Collaborations with tech giants, automotive companies, and research institutions can further boost NVIDIA’s market presence and revenue. ### Considerations and Risks 1. **Supply Chain Constraints**: - **Manufacturing Capacity**: Meeting the high demand may strain NVIDIA’s manufacturing capacity, potentially leading to supply shortages and increased prices. - **Component Shortages**: Global semiconductor shortages can impact the production of GPUs, affecting supply and pricing. 2. **Competitive Landscape**: - **Rival Technologies**: Competitors like AMD and Intel are also advancing their GPU technologies, which could impact NVIDIA’s market share. - **New Entrants**: Emerging companies in the AI and semiconductor space might introduce innovative products, increasing competition. 3. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**: - **AI Regulations**: As governments develop regulations around AI and autonomous systems, compliance could affect development timelines and costs. - **Ethical Implications**: The race towards AGI raises ethical concerns, including safety, job displacement, and privacy issues, which could lead to public and regulatory scrutiny. ### Investment Perspective Given the diverse applications and high demand for GPUs, particularly NVIDIA's products, the company is well-positioned for significant growth. However, potential investors should consider the risks associated with supply chain constraints, competition, and regulatory changes. A balanced investment strategy, possibly including a diversified portfolio of tech stocks, can help mitigate these risks while capitalizing on the growth potential in the GPU market.",8.56933957515353
100,2024-06-18 05:07:15,TearRepresentative56,I'm a professional trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket 18/06 INcludes all the news catalysts that are driving premarket price action. ,"**ANALYSIS:** * NVDA positioning update: * So for this OPEX, we see bullish positioning ITM but slighly more puts opening up. It is slight, but it's there. Lower volumes too. But if we look for a later opEX like August, we can see very bullish positioning OTM. Traders are expecting NVDA to continue rising into August * Traders look like they are even targeting as high as 150 by then. * [ * Across the MAg7 and semis we see strong positioning: * Googl positioning is mostly flat * But AVGO, MU NVDA, SMCI etc all very strong positioning * AMZN positioning flat but improving as traders looking higher. * IWM looks choppy for today but let’s see. * look at USO, which is an oil ETF and will give us a better read on Oil/ bullish and supportive positioning ITM. Not much OTM Put delta but a fair bit of ITM Call delta will support. A lot of call delta on 80, which makes it a target.Not seeing signs of big pullback here rn. * GOld - skew is pointing higher, this tells us that traders are looking higher and senitment is improving, while gold holds 2300. 2350 looks like the resistance atm. Top options are buying calls, selling puts. 2400C a target. Looks like improving momentum under hood, but lets see after retail sales. * [ Here we see top options mostly calls buying and puts selling * FTSE update: still stuck in this downtrend. needs to break 8200 to go higher, below this and we can see pullback, but positioning is improving ITM with more call delta showing up which means that the price action will be more supportive now. * [ * Commodities like Steel look oversold, but positioning is not supporting bounce right now.

101,2024-06-18 18:11:55,Elmksan,What makes a good day trader,"Hi everyone. I've had a RH account for about 4 years now. Over those 4 years I've turned about a thousand dollars into 20,000. Though I frequent WSB, I don't take insane gambles. I usually watch for dips on companies I'm bullish on then buy a long call and am happy to sell it when it reaches a 30 or 40 percent return (and have had a fair share of 200-300+ percent returns). Also have the toughness to suck it up and sell at a loss when the prospects don't look good. It's been consistent for me. I very much wanted to buy NVDA long calls in 2022 but didn't have the money. Very much wanted to buy thousands in Celsius stock when it was a dollar or so. Again, no cash. Could have had a small fortune (for me at least). The past few days have been different. After a lot of research and gauging the general zeitgeist, I put a lot of money into NVDA, TSM, and ARM calls in the past few weeks and months. Also some AMD awhile back and some Apple. All were options, also with a few thousand dollars in fractional shares of stuff like SMCI, MSFT, and semiconductor and AI ETFs. Long story short, this all came together to give me a 3,200 dollar gain today. I made more money in a few hours than I've made working a regular job in 2 months (Ivy League degree, but I work in education, so I get paid shit despite the fancy degree). My question is: am I deluding myself into thinking I may be good at this? I feel strongly that I have the emotional intelligence and risk management skills required to day trade. I don't have any fancy technical tools; mostly just look at basic performance charts, P/E ratios, etc. and read a variety of articles from reputable sources. I think I certainly have the capacity though to learn some more sophisticated analytical tools (fairly strong background in math and logic as well a fair amount of exposure to software, coding, etc.). Should I consider getting into day trading and devoting more time to it, even making it full time? If so, what's my next step? Currently sitting at 22k in my RH account (5K available in margin), as well as a few thousand in Fidelity (all AMAT; another bet I made 6 years ago that's given a huge return). tl;dr : I've 20+xed my Robinhood investment of 1,000 bucks in 4 years, mostly through bullish long options. Should I consider getting into day trading more seriously?",13.435238095238097
102,2024-06-20 13:33:42,Klaus_Winchester,Lost nearly 8k day trading today,I messed up big time today. This was a loan from my parents too. I’m such an idiot I bought NVDA and VRT at the high and kept holding thinking it would bounce back up. But the dang stocks kept dropping today. Finally flattened for an 8k loss. Worked my way back up to -6.5k and now ended day at -7.4k. Just ranting here. Please tell me how tomorrow will be since I need to make this money back. I’m not gonna be able to sleep till I make it all back.,-1.4000000000000001
103,2024-06-20 17:19:33,CLEVAkEV,"Losing sucks! Thankfully, today was a breakthrough! (Highly suggested for beginners)","So today was the kind of day that would normally rough me up. I would have been fighting the trend and trying to find the bottom all the way down like a degenerate. ***But I didn't.*** I actually did quite well trading NVDA, SMCI, and NFLX. The past month has been green except for 3 days. And it isn't luck as I take A LOT of trades, mainly small scalps. It is hard to get lucky with my sample size. I don't full port overnight... I day trade only. Up until April, I was fairly clueless for years. Would go on lucky streaks followed by brutally unlucky ones . Took tons of bad trades that were in the ""buy and hope"" category. Even though I felt an intuitive cringe before taking many of these trades, I still took 'em to prove who knows what to who knows who. And lost a lot of money. It was depressing. I am fairly intelligent and successful person outside of trading... but like a lot of people, trading has often gotten the best of me. The change... I attribute to two things that I now use religiously everyday: prior day range (not the ***average*** range, the prior day) and market structure (as taught by Stoic and DaveFX). There are lots of market structure teachers on Youtube but I ran into them first so if you have someone you like, let me know. I have spent 6-10 hours a day the last couple months pouring over charts and comparing high and lows, higher highs, lower lows. Over and over. Before, this was something I couldn't get myself to do but now I have to take scheduled breaks as I can go hours without looking away from the screen. No indicators other than a M1 chart and a fib bracket that with .10/.25/.382/.5/.618/.75/.9 so I can transpose prior day range over the current day. One of my NVDA scalps today was at 129.53 as that was just above 200% of the prior day range. Thought hey, it could go down further but price action was moving sideways and figured the r/R was worth the shot on a 200 shares. Something just clicked. Charts are much easier to read. I see a story now. Market structure has opened my eyes to how the market actually moves not how I want it to! This has kept me out of my old impulse trades which is the BIGGEST BATTLE a trader can have. If you make impulse trades, it is a double negative as it often leads to losses, mental agitation, revenge trading, and missed legitimate setups. Anyways, all the market structure videos and charting led to some kind of neural connection that makes trading a lot easier. To me, trading is an art form. It requires a unique vision. At this point I can sense where price is headed with fairly high accuracy yet my intellectualization of it might fall flat. It is a knowing that can't be explained. The best kind of traders have balanced intellects and intuition, they can both sense and explain. I am not there yet. Train your brain and never work again. Lay the foundation. There is no magic, just grit and grind. My account is only $30k but I am now consistently taking 10-20 scalps a day and pulling $200 - $1000 a day out of the market. Taking my time and reminding myself gradual growth is the best kind of growth. The best traders I have run across grinded and sized their way so methodically it wasn't noticed. Keep grinding!",13.12962962962963

For the past three weeks I’ve been dipping in and out of various stocks and making a profit (~10k). Again, I’ll chalk this up to luck. So this got me thinking. If I play it conservatively, how hard would it be to make $500 daily with a starting amount of 100K? Based on my previous luck - which want day trading but more swing trading - how feasible is this, and where should I start to learn? I read only about 1% of day traders make a profit.

I generally only trade the SPY but NVDA has been ripe for scalping this week I finally started automating my stop losses instead of doing it manually, and moved them up as profits increased. This really let the winners run moreso than when I am in control of the stops ( I take profit too early) I gave back about $15k trying to increase my green days this week, but no risk, no reward. I generally increase my buy-size if I'm up for the day by more than I expected. Today, I was up $8k by 10am, and ended up only profiting $1100.

I was trading from 3 accounts today. My biggest % return was in premarket when I played NVDL. 6.22%. Hopefully this sheds some light into the process. I loved stuff like this when I was getting my sea legs. (I'm no guru. just trying to make that cheese ya know). Played Uber in premarket and bought it on the open sell off. Reason being is Uber oversold on the daily and at Jan 24 levels. Door Dash just had great earnings and is seeing nice upward move. Listened to Uber earnings call and doesn't seem like they are affected by the recession. Very good call. Plus we had this mini crash and I expected a nice recovery today like yesterday, so I was willing to hold this as a swing trade if needed. Stocks can always go lower and anything can happen but with all of these stacked in my favor the risk was worth it. Picked up some NVDL when NVDA hit $100 in premarket. My META short. Well one of them. My classic reversal trade. So butter so creamy and it's fat free. Thanks Anna Coulling. Here's one of the Uber plays. I played this from two different accounts. My one account I sized in on the way down once we were down I went full size in other account. I saw price slowing down and I saw support at the $60 level on Bookmap. Ok one more bonus one. This is another short on META. I shorted META 3 times today. So I saw this on 5 min and 15 min was showing Bearish RSI divergence. Look how price continues to go higher while RSI continues to exhaust and go lower. It was turning over at least a little bit. I don't need a big move down just a little move or a retracement to make my money.",17.13468013468013

120,2024-08-15 11:33:13,CryptographerOk4571,Trading is so damn frustrating! ,"I am so trying to get more out of my winners, but my emotions always get the best of me, and i sell or partial too early. Just today i was in NVDA and TSLA. I had taken some profits initially and added on to both of them as they were going in my direction. They started chopping around when the market started going down and i ended up selling both of them without waiting for them to come to my breakeven. My thesis was that atleast let me walk away with some profit, than give away all the unrealized profit by waiting them to come to my breakeven. Turned out both of them rallied hard after i sold, and i ended up with literally half the profit then i could have on the day. If they would have come to my breakeven then my profit would have been even lower for the day, so maybe i should be just happy that i made more by not waiting for the price to come to breakeven, but if i had actually hold i could have made 100% more on what i ended the day on. My trade execution needs a lot of practice. So damn frustrating. Sorry. just ranting to get over it.",12.75793650793651
121,2024-08-16 23:08:26,NonprivatePosterior,I think I’m doing pretty good,"got around 3k to invest and threw it all into NVDA when it was at around 134 dollars, it tanked my portfolio down to 2.1k and that’s when I realized that holding long term is way too stressful for me. Switched strategies and started day trading SPY and SPY only, made back my losses and then some over the course of ~3 weeks. I had no experience day trading beforehand, but I talked to a friend who was experienced in the art of trading and he taught me a couple of indicators and gave me a book to read, which I think helped tremendously as I learned that not being a smartass and trying to outsmart the market by going against trends/predicting reversals. Maybe this is divine intervention or unparalleled luck, but I think I’ll try pushing this to 10k by the end of august. Regardless, I’m quite proud of this, even though this might be pocket change to some 😁",24.682539682539684
122,2024-08-17 18:48:10,daytradelife1,The Unfiltered Truth About Day Trading Realities,"Day trading. The thrill of making quick profits, the freedom to work from anywhere, and the potential to live a life of luxury. It's an enticing prospect, and many of us have been drawn to its promise. Many people think day trading is a get-rich-quick scheme, where you simply jump into the market, make a few trades, and voilà, you're a millionaire. Others believe it's a thrilling lifestyle, where you're always on the edge of your seat, making bold moves, and reaping massive rewards. But let's be real, most of these perceptions are fueled by social media and Hollywood movies. The reality is far from glamorous. In reality, day trading is a tough business. The failure rates are staggering, with some estimates suggesting that up to 90% of new traders lose their entire trading account within the first few months. Yes, you heard that right – 90%! And it's not because they're stupid or lazy; it's because they're unprepared, naive, or simply don't have the right mindset. The truth is, day trading is a skill that requires dedication, hard work, and a deep understanding of the markets. It's not a hobby or a side hustle; it's a full-time job that demands your attention, discipline, and patience. And even then, there are no guarantees of success. Let's talk about the realities of day trading. Market volatility is a constant threat, and even the best traders in the world can't predict what will happen next. Emotional discipline is crucial, because one impulsive decision can wipe out your entire account. And education – oh, education is key. You need to have a deep understanding of technical analysis, fundamental analysis, risk management, and trading psychology. But even with all these factors in place, day trading is a game of probability. You can do everything right and still lose. You can follow the best strategies, use the best tools, and still end up in the red. That's just the nature of the beast. So, what's the key to success in day trading? Is it magic? Is it luck? No, it's actually quite simple. It's about understanding that day trading is a marathon, not a sprint. It's about being consistent, patient, and persistent. It's about adapting to changing market conditions, learning from your mistakes, and constantly improving your craft. The average trader's experience is a rollercoaster of emotions, with moments of euphoria followed by periods of despair. They're constantly chasing the next big trade, the next big win, without realizing that consistency is the key to long-term success. They're like gamblers, always looking for the next fix, the next rush of adrenaline. But the few who achieve consistent success – they're a different breed altogether. They're the ones who understand the importance of discipline, risk management, and education. They're the ones who take the time to develop a solid trading plan, to backtest their strategies, and to refine their skills. In conclusion, the allure of day trading is real, but the realities are harsh. It's not a game for the faint of heart, and it's certainly not a get-rich-quick scheme. If you're thinking of becoming a day trader, you need to have realistic expectations, a solid understanding of the markets, and a deep commitment to your craft.",9.41027066027066

126,2024-08-23 16:38:35,Scary-Compote-3253,Best $SPY Day Trading Setup?,"Wanted to share a setup that I look for as part of my daily strategy. I have been trading $SPY religiously for over 5 years now, and this setup is one of the highest probability trades you can grab if you catch it. For those of you not familiar with divergences, this is a hidden bearish divergence. You can see clearly that the chart is showing a clear difference in direction compared to the TSI oscillator on the bottom. These clear differences are some of the best trades to take especially for a quick turnaround. You can also confirm these directions by adding the TTM Squeeze indicator and the Ultimate Oscillator, if you get the same confirmations on all 3… Even better. I confirm these divergences with the sell signal from TO, meaning I don’t take the trade unless a signal is fired. I recommend everyone to look into this, even if you don’t use signals, these are great trades to look for, and high probability. If you guys have any feedback on experience you have trading divergences, I’d love to hear it! Hope you guys have a great weekend!",25.67156862745098

Let me share a couple rules I have learned to follow over the past few years. 1. Don’t trade before 10:30am (1 hour after market open. - This eliminates the higher volatility and usually is able to pick a more profound direction. 2. Only take trades off of good setups. - This divergence is a good example of a good setup. You have a clear picture where you can place your stop loss (right above the high) and place the trade. Also breaking VWAP, and the 200ma are good places to trade as well. 3. Set percentage goals on your position size. I NEVER look at the percentage of my account gain, I only look at the percentage that my position size gain is. My usual PT is 30%. Looking at it from this standpoint in my opinion helps grow your account much more consistently. Those are just a few things I follow to a T. I definitely encourage everyone to start looking for these types of divergences and just sticking to a strategy instead of flip flopping around which is where most go wrong.

Still hold shares purchased on 9/12 Called Schwab and went back and forth after going on FINRA rules, they looked and said the PDT flag was and error and would be removed (and not be my one time removal) Call again this morning as PDT flag still exists, Schwab claims the opposite of yesterday, PDT flag remains in effect.

135,2024-09-14 09:35:54,Content_Substance943,Momo Strat For $NVDA,"Fwiw.... Backtested a momentum strat for NVDA over the last 30 market sessions. 100% mechanical. No nuance. It was either take 100% profit or 100% loss. No ema, no vwap, no magic. Just used 2 day prior range and %'s. The R/R was: 1.67 , win was 25% of 2 day prior range, loss was 15% of prior 2 day range. The strategy: Take hi/low range for last two market sessions combined (I used daily hi/lo indicator on ToS.) Using total prior 2 day range, the play started when price hit the 25% mark in either direction. It is a momentum play, so when price went down 25% of prior 2 day range, it triggered a short and vice versa. If price momentum stalled and reversed, the stop was at the 10% mark. Take profit was price continuing on to hit the 50% mark. So a loss was 15% of prior 2 day range and a win was 25% of prior 2 day range. Totals: 11 LOSSES for a Total of 1547 cents (Average loser was 140 cents) 17 WINS for a Total of 3637 cents (Average winner was 214 cents) 3 plays were flat ending the day near the trigger bar.",5.519323671497587
136,2024-09-16 18:45:07,jabberw0ckee,The Importance of Repeating Patterns,"No matter your trading style or criteria for entry and exit, every trader should understand the repeating patterns of the Stock Markets. The main patterns are Intraday Patterns and Annual Patterns. They are important because they can be a guide for how you trade. **Intraday Daily Market Patterns** One of the complaints I hear a lot from new traders is they sometimes take a lot of profit in the morning, only to give it up by over trading later in the day. Is this due to overtrading or just trading the wrong stock at the wrong time? In my opinion it has more to do with trading the wrong stock at the wrong time. The market has distinct intraday patterns that repeat pretty much the same way every day and if you know the pattern it can help you make trading decisions on which stocks to ride in the afternoon...or not. Below is a screen shot of the NVDA chart for Monday June 3rd 2024 which I’ve divided into the various distinct time periods that mark a change in the trading pattern for any given day. Each trading day follows this general pattern. There are primary intraday patterns that divide the trading day into three main parts and several other time frames within the primary divisions. **Primary Intraday Pattern** 1. **Morning** * **High volume** * **High volatility** * Profit taking from overnight gains * Selling from fear of loss * FOMO buying pre market gap * Buying in General 2. **Midday** * **Lower Volume** * **Decreasing Momentum** * Often Reverses * European / London traders exit U.S. market * NY Lunch hour * Less traders in general after morning session 3. **Afternoon** * **Increasing Volume** * **Increasing Momentum** * Sometimes Reverses * Bargain shoppers * Investors grabbing new positions * Losers finally sell **4**. 9:30 - 9:45: Market open which is often volatile as traders shed their positions after movement from the day or night before. This could be profit taking and is often seen when a stock gaps up in pre-market and traders sell their positions as the market opens. There can also be a frenzy of buying a stock that just became hot and the opening is often a combination of both in high volume and intensity. **5**. 9:45, 10:00 - 10:30 - There is often a reversal or big pull pack in volume at 9:45 and the following movement is the stocks trajectory for the morning. Usually around 10:00 the trajectory of a stock will become clear. If a stock posts new highs and lows, the stock will move up until at least 12:00 and could continue longer. If a stock is posting lower highs and lower lows, the stock will move down at least until 12:00 and could continue longer. **6**. 11:00 - 11:30 -Volume begins to slow considerably as European and London traders end their day and exit the U.S. market. Volume and momentum decrease and reversals often occur. **7.** 12:00 - 1:15 - Volume and momentum slows even more as the NY lunch hour begins. Reversals may happen. **8**. 1:15 - 2:00 - Volume begins to pick up. The contraction during lunch begins to expand and price breakouts can occur as NY traders return from lunch. **9.** 2:00 - 2:45 - Most stocks may see a reversal during this period. Any trends that developed during or just after lunch may reverse at 2:00 or between 2:15 and 2:45. **10.** 3:00 - 3:45 - There is often a momentum change this time with volume and momentum increasing. Often this is the last chance to take advantage of strong movement within a stock until the final selling and buying at the end of the day. Bargain hunters enter the market and grab low priced stocks at the end of the day or ride the momentum of upstanding stocks. If a stock is dropping, reluctant sellers shed loss positions and bargain hunters snatch them up. **11.** 3:45 - 4:00 - The final 15 minutes may see drastic price movements, price jumps or rapid declines. If you plan to close a position it’s probably best to do it before the last 5 minutes. A trader who understands these intraday market patterns will know when to wait before making a trade. If a market slow down is potentially going to happen, a trader may choose to wait a few more minutes before making a trade to determine the new trajectory our to ensure the momentum is still moving in the right direction. **Annual Repeating Patterns** The chart below illustrates the general pattern of all the markets. You can see there are common repeating periods where the markets are rising or falling. These patterns can be seen in the overall performance of the markets and stocks for each month. If you look at the annual charts for the markets, they generally follow this pattern with variations. Some years like the pandemic years are anomalies, but for the most part, markets follow this pattern every year. Why is this important? [Annual Market Pattern]( For me and especially because of my trading style which combines day trading and swing trading, I listen to how the markets breath. I trade more assertively during periods of upswing, less assertively during seasonal periods of decline. I generally day trade stock worth long term investing and only trade the stock when the stock has analyst Buy and Strong Buy ratings and the stock's price is below the average analysts price target. In other words the stock should go up so if I absolutely have to hold a losing stock, I will, if I'm trading in a seasonal upswing. If I'm approaching a seasonal downswing period, I will tend not to hold any stock and make it a point to move out of any Swing positions I have to be ""In Cash"" because I also try to buy Swing positions at a relative low during the worst market periods so I can ride them up during the next incoming good period. The chart is a stacked chart to easily visualize the up and down of each of the markets and how they coincide. There is no significance for the numbers on the Y axis, except they are used to rank each month in relation to best, worst, good, or bad - historic data. This is a stacked chart and no significance to which market is on top or middle or bottom. They are stacked so you can easily see that all three follow the same annual pattern. This is only a guideline, and every year is different but influenced by the same pressures that create the general pattern.",5.387341824841824

Said basically that they will be watchful - hawkish. Said they will remain sufficiently restrictive until they are confident on CPI. * Despite this, AUD not moved much higher. But the China stimulus news should be a tailwind for AUD. AUD is right up against a major resistance here, hence why it couldn’t break, but I would expect that it should break with these tailwinds soon. * Yesterday macro data showed ISM services in US came in strong, manufacturing weak but this is a known thing. * House price index data out later today. * IFO business data in Germany came weak, continued problems for the economy there. * German institutes have slashed GDP forecast to -0.1% in 2024.

141,2024-09-24 10:17:21,bjmoghadam,Please check my conspiracy theory,"Gotta tap the community before I go nuts. I'm about 2 years into full-time trading, using ThinkOrSwim daily (Schwab). I regularly track and trade 3 active stocks, and watch them dip and spike in unison all the live-long day. As soon as I see my setup, I choose which stock to jump into, usually going with the one I've traded least. On one hand, I KNOW my few hundred shares aren't dictating the price of NVDA or AMD. On the other, I'm a friggin' GENIUS at picking the one that DOESN'T move, while watching the others do exactly what I expected based on the setup. I tell myself, ""patience, dude - don't dump it yet"", and just watch it push down and down, like a bully determined to muscle me out. When I'm stubborn and try to wait it out, it keeps pushing down until I give up and take a big loss. When I dump it quickly to avoid the big loss, it suddenly finds its upward mobility and I miss the move entirely. I've just seen this happen waaaaay too many times to not start thinking something's rotten in Denmark. Am I alone? Is it purely psychological? I know Schwab is a ""payment for order flow"" broker, so my trust factor isn't super high. Thanks in advance for any perspective (and/or ridicule).",0.9166666666666675

There was a gap to fill back down to the $570 level, so in the back of my mind, that’s what I’m looking for today especially when we started in a downtrend. So as you can see, we filled the gap down to $570, and at the SAME TIME, we had a bullish divergence. That to me is a perfect spot to take the trade. Grabbed $571 calls when the signal came and it was a slow grind but was able to grab 30% off those contracts. Was really a no brainer and I hope some of you saw the same thing!

152,2024-10-01 12:24:37,United_College_7403,Am I missing something?,"Hi guys! First time posting here, and I wanted to share my experience from my first day of trading. In a few months, I’ll be a father—specifically a single father—and I really need money so I can spend as much time as possible with my son/daughter and give them the best life I can. A few months ago, I started with crypto, but for me, it was too slow. So last week, I came across Trade Republic and its turbo warrants. The feeling I got from turbo warrants was that they seemed too good to be true. They are highly leveraged derivatives, but to me, they looked like easy money, and I thought the risks could be minimized by just paying attention to the numbers. Still, I felt like something was missing. Nobody gives away money that easily. Today, I transferred €1,000 to my account and started trading for just a few minutes. I made €300 in less than an hour (just by buying and selling NVDA, Gold, Tesla, Visa... turbo warrants). Since it was my first time, I tried to be a bit greedy to see how risky I could get. I ended up losing some money, but the whole experience netted me €190 in profits. I know it’s not a lot compared to some people here who make thousands, but today I earned as much as I would in a day of work (I make €2,100 a month). Maybe I won’t make that much money every day, but it really feels like if I’m not too greedy, I could maintain this level of profit daily. So, the question is: am I missing something? Or is it really that easy to earn extra money? **TL;DR:** I made €190 in a day, and I’m suspicious it could be like this every day.",14.213464696223319

Said they are ready for any retaliation. Most were shot down. * Israeli PM says Iran made a big mistake tonight and will pay for it. * Iranian president describes Israel’s Iron dome as more vulnerable than glass. * Market basically awaiting Israeli response. Likely to be targeted at Iran’s Oil infrastructure. This will be the key. * I believe from reading rhetoric of Iran’s chiefs, that their attack is all they really want to do. So if Israel’s response is measured, it should be the end soon. MACRO news: * Euro unemployment rate was 6.4% in line with expectations. * ADP numbers came stronger than expected. 143k vs 120k expected. That’s strong. Points to strong NFP on Friday most likely.

Has broken uptrend. * QQQ lower in premarket, has also broken out of uptrend. * Dow Jones faring better than their tech and SPX counterparts, due to concentration of more defensive names on this index. * GEr40: Holding the 19k level. Traders continue to hold calls on 20k. * HKG50 Pumped again overnight. Up 6% on the day. That makes it up 32% in the last 10 days, the largest move since 1980. This is a gamma squeeze. We can see some pullback but order flow remains strong suggesting move is not done. 13 days of gains so far. * China50 is closed for national holiday. * VIX popped yesterday on geopolitical news. Went above 20 then came down. 20 is a key level. * Oil higher on supply disruption risk. * Gold - higher on safe haven appeal. FOREX: * Dollar positioning more bullish on safe haven appeal.

GBPUSD slightly stronger than EURUSD but skew lower as dollar component skew higher. * AUDUSD holding up the best because of China growth story. * USDJPY lower as Ishiba says not in position for more rate hikes.

Gets rid of home button, transitioning to edge to edge screen like iPhone 14. Will support Apple Intelligence. * NVDA - halts development on dual rack Ai server, opts for single rack instead. While this doesn’t affect Nvidia's long-term AI trends, it could lead to some short-term market concerns about execution capabilities. * META: given an overweight rating and price target of 652 by Wells Fargo. Said they anticipate another robust quarter and solid forward guidance, but don’t expect it to materially change consensus estimates. Ai winner but maybe rangebound until the earnings. * GOOGL: Wells Fargo rates equal weight, price target 182. Said they maintain Q3 search growth but raise reported search revenue by 0.7%, due to FX.

CEO Tom Werner cited improved volume and cost management but noted soft demand for frozen potatoes and restaurant traffic, which is expected to persist through FY25. * To address this, Lamb Weston is closing its Connell, WA facility, temporarily curtailing some production lines, and reducing its global workforce by about 4%. The company also cut FY25 capex to $750M (from $850M) and expects $55M in pre-tax savings from these actions.

The S&P 500 dipped 0.17%, the Dow dropped 0.44%, and the Nasdaq hovered just below the flatline. Investors also kept a close eye on oil, which soared for a third straight day amid rising tensions in the Middle East. Fears of an Israeli retaliation against Iran’s oil facilities fueled the rally, sending energy stocks like Valero and Diamondback higher. * On the economic front, the U.S. labor market sent mixed signals. ADP’s private-sector hiring numbers looked strong, but weekly jobless claims came in slightly above expectations. Meanwhile, oil prices remained in focus, with traders bracing for potential supply disruptions from the conflict.

After a failed merger with JetBlue, the budget carrier is exploring bankruptcy options, discussing a potential restructuring under Chapter 11 with bondholders. It’s not looking good for the airline that's been trying to find some altitude amid mounting losses. Spirit is scrambling to figure out what to do with its $3.3 billion debt, including $1.1 billion of secured bonds coming due soon. CEO Ted Christie has been in talks with bondholders, but let’s be honest—the options are running out. After the JetBlue merger fell apart in January, leaving Spirit in financial limbo, the airline lost the chance to join forces and create the fifth-largest carrier in the US. Now, instead of coasting on JetBlue’s coattails, Spirit is left battling steep losses and shrinking operations. With bankruptcy potentially looming, Spirit’s balance sheet is far from stable. Its operational footprint has been shrinking—Spirit plans to slash capacity by nearly 20% in Q4, and it just furloughed 186 pilots. Not to mention, Spirit’s credit card processor has set an October 21 deadline to refinance or extend its notes. **A Rocky Ride** Spirit hasn't posted an annual profit since before COVID, and even as travel has rebounded, the low-cost carrier hasn't found its footing. Major airlines are getting better at matching Spirit's budget fares, and the recall of Pratt & Whitney engines grounded part of its fleet, making things even tougher. Routes have been cut, costs are being slashed, but the competition keeps ramping up. The debt clock is ticking, and without a merger to fall back on, Spirit is flying solo through some pretty stormy skies. With fewer routes, mounting debt, and an increasingly competitive market, Spirit Airlines needs more than just luck to keep soaring. # # Market Movements * **🏦 Bank of America Outage Causes Frustration:** Bank of America ($BAC) experienced an outage on Wednesday, leaving some customers unable to access accounts or seeing $0 balances.

Chrysler and Dodge sales dropped more than 40%, while other brands, excluding Fiat, also saw negative growth.

The company’s focus on larger, pricier vehicles has backfired as American consumers turn toward more affordable, smaller cars. * **💊 Eli Lilly's Mounjaro and Zepbound No Longer in Short Supply:** The FDA has announced that Eli Lilly's weight loss and diabetes drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, are now readily available after previously facing shortages. * **👖 Levi Strauss Eyes Sale of Dockers:** Levi Strauss reported mixed Q3 results, including a 15% sales drop for its Dockers segment.

Thrive Capital, led by Josh Kushner, took the lead with a $1.3 billion investment, while Microsoft—OpenAI’s most dedicated cheerleader—added another $750 million to its $13 billion pile. Other heavy hitters like Khosla Ventures, Fidelity, Nvidia, and SoftBank couldn't resist jumping on the AI hype train. With this cash infusion, OpenAI is officially rubbing shoulders with the elite—joining the ranks of the top three venture-backed startups, alongside SpaceX and TikTok’s parent, ByteDance. But it’s not just about the dollars; it’s about strategy. OpenAI is playing it smart by keeping rivals at bay—asking investors to steer clear of backing competitors like Anthropic and Musk's xAI. Staying on top isn’t just about innovation—it’s about making sure others don’t catch up. **Fueling the AI Dream** This new funding will power more AI research and expand computing capacity, keeping OpenAI at the forefront of the field. Their star attraction, ChatGPT, now flaunts 250 million weekly active users. But there’s a price to pay—OpenAI expects to burn through $5 billion this year against $3.7 billion in revenue. Developing next-level AI tech isn’t exactly a budget-friendly hobby. OpenAI’s internal shakeups have added to the drama. CEO Sam Altman got the boot and then came back like a Silicon Valley comeback story. Plus, key figures like co-founder Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati have exited, stirring uncertainty. There’s also talk of ditching the nonprofit label for a for-profit model—a move that makes investors giddy but could come with its own set of legal headaches. **Zoom Out** AI is more than just cool tech—it’s a battleground, and OpenAI is right in the thick of it. Heavyweights like Google and Meta are breathing down its neck, while new challengers are cropping up everywhere. With a potential IPO on the horizon, Sam Altman and his team are betting big on their vision—and their capital. Buckle up, because the AI race just went into overdrive. # # On The Horizon # Tomorrow Brace yourselves—tomorrow’s jobs report is shaping up to be a big one. Ever since July’s job data tanked the market, investors have been glued to these reports. That month’s lower-than-expected employment numbers had everyone panicking that the Fed might have missed the mark on managing a recession, sending stocks into a nosedive. August helped ease those fears a bit, with 142,000 jobs added (a nice recovery from July’s 114,000) and unemployment holding steady at 4.2%. But the labor market remains in the spotlight, especially with the Fed tying future rate decisions to employment data. September’s numbers? Economists are eyeing 140,000 new jobs, a slight dip but nothing too alarming—unless it’s much lower. In that case, October’s already shaky market could take a serious hit.",8.07710394763966

The report accused Roblox of inflating user data and failing to protect its youngest players from harmful content. Naturally, the stock took a dive, dropping nearly 10% in early trading—a steep fall for the platform that’s been a favorite among younger gamers. **More Bots Than Humans?** Hindenburg’s beef? The firm claims Roblox has been cooking the books by counting bots and duplicate accounts as individual users. According to the report, Roblox's daily user count may be overstated by up to 42%. And while Roblox claims its users are spending hours immersed in the digital world, Hindenburg suggests a lot of that ""engagement"" comes from bots that are just... there. But the bigger blow? Hindenburg also painted a grim picture of the platform’s safety features, claiming Roblox isn’t doing enough to keep predators at bay. And for a platform with millions of young users, that’s a serious accusation. **Roblox Fights Back** Roblox wasn’t about to sit quietly. The company shot back, calling Hindenburg’s report ""misleading"" and driven by the short-seller’s agenda. In a statement, they emphasized that user safety is a top priority and that the financial metrics they report are accurate. Roblox's defense comes with some financial backing: the company saw a 22% boost in bookings year-over-year and reported $576 million in free cash flow for the second quarter. **The Fallout:** Despite the firm’s aggressive rebuttal, Roblox’s stock took a hit, falling by 9.4% before regaining some ground. Investors are likely left wondering if Hindenburg’s accusations will have lasting effects or if Roblox can shake off the controversy like it has before. Either way, it’s clear that the platform’s future will be closely watched, especially when it comes to how it handles both its user base—and the safety of those users. # # Market Movements * 📱 **Epic v.

The Hang Seng Index dropped nearly 10%, marking its worst day since 2008, while Chinese stocks lost almost half their gains from an 11% surge earlier in the day. The market's reaction is a clear sign of a mismatch between investor expectations and Beijing’s cautious fiscal stance. The rally, driven by monetary easing and government promises, now seems shaky without substantial fiscal follow-through. **Stocks on a Rollercoaster** It wasn’t just disappointment in the air—it was a stock sell-off. Bank of China tumbled 5.38%, and the yuan slipped 0.64% against the dollar. The once-booming rally fizzled as investors realized that Tuesday’s announcement wasn’t the knockout punch they were hoping for. Analysts at Jefferies had pegged the potential damage at 175 billion yuan in a worst-case scenario, but Beijing’s response left the markets wondering if that punch is ever coming.For a brief moment, China’s stock market had a party—rising over 30% since late September—but the NDRC’s meager offering effectively ended the celebration. **Is There More in the Pipeline?** While Tuesday’s lackluster stimulus dampened spirits, some analysts believe the big guns are still on their way. Banks like Morgan Stanley are betting that up to 2 trillion yuan in stimulus could still be in the works. The key question now: Will President Xi pull the trigger before markets lose faith? For now, traders are left in a wait-and-see mode, with hopes that Beijing will unveil the kind of aggressive fiscal measures needed to fuel a long-term recovery. Until then, investors might need to buckle up for more market turbulence. # # On The Horizon # Tomorrow Tomorrow’s looking like a breather ahead of the CPI report, with wholesale inventories being the main event.

This cause the rapid run up in Chinese stocks to somewhat be pared. * However, as chinese equities dumped last night and the day before, We see China’s Finance ministry will now hold a briefing to talk about further fiscal policy adjustment. China turned their tone very quickly there after seeing equities dump. * Note chinese is all down anyway today. Yesterday was disappointing. * ECB’s Patsalides more or less confirms October rate cut. ECB’s Stournaras too. * ECB’s Kazmir however says he’s less sure on a cut in October. Nonetheless the market more or less has fully priced in that ECB will be cutting this month.",2.3956453151368415
166,2024-10-09 14:41:32,rhbegirl,Another wash sale question,"I know, this topic is probably exhausting for everyone, but I’m perfectly willing to admit my ignorance. First. I’m bipolar and have severe dissociation. I started trading stocks during an episode so I had no clue what I was doing. It was so bad I don’t even remember opening the account. Even when I’m feeling good I shouldn’t be anywhere near this. From what I can see, I had a $50,000 account and ended up losing $25,000. I did a TON of wash sales on NVDA all on full margin. I traded from June-August. Literally hundreds, if not thousands of trades. Most shares I ever had was 1000. I did buying and shorting. Now that I’m finally out of the manic episode, I am scared to death of what is going to happen with taxes. I have read probably every post on wash sales but it just isn’t clicking because I don’t understand most of the terms. Will all of this even out since I haven’t traded since August, or am I in store for an IRS nightmare? I’m just scared. Finally feeling better with my mental health and now I have this uncertainty that is making me sick mentally again.",7.571428571428568

","MACRO DATA: * GDP YoY came in short of consensus, at 1% vs 1.4% expected * 3 month average was also slightly short of consensus * MOM was in line. So weak GDP numbers * Inflation rate in Germany came in line with expectations - this was a final revision so not a big deal. Preliminary print had already paved the way. * PPI event today. * Consumer inflation expectations - expected to have risen as commodity index has been on the rise. * Current conditions probably slightly better than expected, but let’s see. I say this as the economic surprise index has been trending up meaning we are more likely to surprise to upside than downside right now. MARKETS: * SPX slightly down in premarket, mostly dragged by Tesla. * Nasdaq the same * GER40 Flat today * Dow up as banking earnings come strong * Gold higher in premarket as positioning is strong. * HKG50 slightly higher as Fiscal announcements to come on Monday TSLA 10/10 EVENT * Analyst reaction is that of disappointment by lack of substantive details and no announcement of Model 2. Tech on show was good though. No update on rate of improvement in FSD system. I am reading a number of big bank research desks making this same criticism. * UBS went as far as to rate Tesla a sell. * NVDA: Goldman raises PT to 150 from 135. Conviction Buy * **Nvidia’s latest AI chips, Blackwell, are sold out for the next 12-months, media report, citing Nvidia’s management team, including CEO Jensen Huang, at investor meetings hosted by Morgan Stanley. Customers ordering the chips today will receive them late next year** * AMZN - Record Amazon Prime sales day. * AMZN rated outperform by Scotiabank who give price target 245. Says they have high confidence consumers will increasingly use Amazons services and optimistic on the company’s ability to monetise AI. * We expect near- to medium-term opportunities in corporate use cases GOOGL - Scotiabank rate outperform, PT of 212. ""We have a high level of confidence that consumers will increasingly use Alphabet's services in the future, and we are optimistic about the company's ability to monetize its AI investments."" * LOL they literally used the same analysis piece for both AMZN and GOOGL. Wtf. OTHER COMPANIES * UBER - pumping this morning as Tesla’s robotaxi event disappointment seen as bullish for UBER. Citi note that **Tesla's event yesterday was a POSITIVE outcome for Uber, as Tesla did not provide verifiable evidence of progress toward Level 3 autonomy or specific robotaxi production numbers. This removes a major overhang and allows investors to focus on UBER fundamentals** * AMD EVENT YDAY: Down 4% yesterday, flat in premarket today. Is a major tailwind for NVDA funnily enough, more so than AMD although AMD price action probably overreaction. * Again, I have a full post on this with all of my thoughts here: * Mixed reaction from analysts. Wells Fargo say is a buy. Overweight, PT 205. Others say was a bit of a non event. * RACE: JPM upgrades RACE to overweight, raises PT to 525. * Said they are upgrading shares after investor meeting with CEO highlighted positives including drivers of high visibility earnings growth.

177,2024-10-18 13:50:51,jabberw0ckee,Swing Trading Vs. Day Trading: F*CK Your Stop Loss,"UPDATE: Swing trade vs Day Trading + Hold Overnight Since October 14th Open to October 30 close - NVDA: Swing % up unrealized 2.06%. Day Trade % up realized 20.21% Long time investor, swing trader, and day trader. I've been doing all three for a while and my girlfriend, who's a swing trader, used to tell me day trading was a Fool's Errand until she saw how profitable I am. One of the ways I illustrated this to her was to compete with her over a period of time as she swing traded stock and I day traded the same stock. As it turned out, day trading was an order of magnitude better at reaping profits than swing trading. The exercise prompted me to experiment with day trading in slightly different ways to figure out profitable, easy ways to day trade and make profits. Here's what I've learned about stocks over the years. 1. Almost all stocks of healthy companies and, especially ETF's (which cycle out bad stock and cycle in good stocks periodically), trend net upward over time. Sure they go up and down, but overall they go up. 2. Almost all stock and ETF's make their real gains overnight. [ 3. Although most gains are made overnight, stock prices swing considerably, up and down, during the intraday. 4. The markets intraday have repeating patterns. [ 5. The markets also have annual patterns. [ 6. Stock with Buy and Strong Buy analyst ratings that are below their price targets tend to trade upward toward that target much more often than not. Knowing all this, we can infer a trading strategy: Find a good stock with lots of upside, high volume, strong buy ratings from analysts, and average analyst price targets above the stocks current price and day trade it aggressively without a stop loss during up trending seasons and hold the stock overnight, every night (well, almost every night). Then, never hold it when a down trending season is approaching. Take NVDA for example, which has increased 227% over the past year. If you day traded and held NVDA overnight, you'd have made considerably more than 227%. If you consider seasonal downturns which occur mainly in February, June, and September and you day trade without holding the stock overnight and accept any intraday loss - but try to avoid them - you'd make even more $$. Anyway, I decided to quantify and collect evidence starting this week and I will continue for this Q4 up trending season. All U.S. markets have their best gains in Q4 from roughly the end of October to the end of December. Often, though, the market continues to make gains until March with a dip in February. This week NVDA from Monday open to Friday's close gained -.01%. However, if you day traded NVDA as I did you would have made $$ instead of losing it like a swing trader or long term investor. Look at all those ups and downs on the NVDA chart for this week! Perfectly ripe for Day Trade pickin'! So, I day traded and held NVDA every night this week and am still holding it. Instead of losing -.01%, I earned over $900. I also day traded a lot of other stock for more profit than just $900, but this is what I earned from NVDA. I'll be continuing this probably until NVDA announced earnings in March 2025. Day trading is much more profitable than swing trading and long term investing. I often day trade and hold overnight during up trending seasons for the reasons illustrated above. Oh, yeah, I also do not use stop losses. So, F your stop loss.",18.308139534883725

183,2024-10-21 14:25:13,lightningnotes,Intermediate Market Education - Where to start,"Hey all, First Reddit post ever, so bear with me. I have been trading options on the side since 2021, mainly on RH and TD Ameritrade before it switched to Schwab. I would say I have somewhat of an edge and high risk tolerance, and have had some great days and swings ($10k-$40k) buying naked calls and puts, usually weeklies-2 weeks out, but have of course had many losses as well ($5k -$11k). I typically trade SPY, QQQ, SPX, NVDA, SPX and a few other large caps, and have always taken my own trades. Average account size is usually $2,000-$7,000. I have never really journaled my trades or defined full trade plans, price targets, proper risk management strategies, or a full set of trading rules: Have just entered 2-8 day swings based on levels, sector/market strength, volume, or my own conviction, **or** have gotten lucky catching moves on trend days/news events. (I understand this is not a viable strategy, and I have definitely blown up accounts.) I would say that my 2 edges if any have been swing trading and not being afraid to add size on a trade. I have by no means been a profitable options trader (yet) and do not have the best risk management. I also need to focus on patience. With that being said, I have worked full time up until recently, and haven't fully taken the time to learn charting, technical analysis, chart patterns, candlesticks, or a greater understanding of the market. However I usually keep up with market news and monitor price action daily. Have also traded strictly on mobile due to being at work and not having the time to pull up charts or invest a lot of time (work in sales, 50-60 hour weeks). I have been in a few solid discords (Desitrade's Option Insider, The Traveling Trader) and follow many solid traders on twitter, and have leveraged other's charts, resistance/support and supply/demand levels from Twitter/Discord to help influence my trades. While I am extremely thankful and grateful for these resources, I need to learn how to chart and become efficient on my own so I can do these things on my own. I am in a career re-evaluation period and have recently stepped out of my role to consider a few different opportunities, so spending some free time to dive into the markets further. I've bought some books to expand my knowledge (A Complete Guide To Volume Price Analysis, Mastering The Trade by John Carter, Trading in the Zone.) **I am asking for suggestions** on where it would be best to allocate my focus to and where time would be best spent right now for where I am at**,** whether it be getting set up with a broker on desktop, understanding bullish/bearish patterns, paper trading on desktop, analyzing charts, learning candlesticks, etc. What is the most important thing that one should learn first when it comes to options trading and TA? Given I have experience live trading, an understanding of the Greeks, and **some** knowledge on trading. I wish it was the other way around and I hadn't had experience/exposure without learning the basics first, but it is what it is. I did get set up on Tradezella today as well. I have been watching various videos on YT and getting started on the books, but there is an overwhelming amount of content out there and I'm overwhelmed on where to start to find the most value. I have a lot to learn in every area, and I know my current methods are more focused toward a gambling mentality that is not sustainable. I've been spending time on TOS and Tradingview playing around with features and indicators, but have had a hell of a time trying to look at/set up charts and navigate these platforms without feeling overwhelmed or helpless. I will honestly say that I've unfortunately never been that great at teaching myself things this technical, but I am willing to commit and I do understand that there will be many learning curves that require patience. I also know that the switch from mobile to desktop will not be easy. After spending a majority of my focus on trading education over the past week, I don't know that I have what it takes to become a full time trader and I don't believe that is what I want, but I do want to challenge myself and try to learn these skills so I can also have them for a lifetime.

184,2024-10-21 17:05:26,Virtual_Information3,Stock Market Today: Goldman’s Grim Forecast For The S&P 500 + Disney will name Bob Iger’s replacement in early 2026,"* Investors are gearing up for a busy week, with over 110 S&P 500 companies, including Tesla and Coca-Cola, set to report earnings. The S&P 500 slipped 0.18% after hitting a fresh all-time high, while the Dow dropped over 300 points. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq managed a 0.27% gain, keeping tech in the green. * After a six-week winning streak, the market’s taking a breather. Rising Treasury yields and election buzz are also keeping traders on their toes. Despite the dip, the S&P hasn’t had back-to-back losses in nearly 30 sessions—one of the longest runs since 1928. # # Winners & Losers # What’s up 📈 * **Save** climbed 53.06% higher Monday morning as the carrier said it extended a deadline for debt refinancing with Visa and Mastercard.

Well, giddy up because Goldman Sachs is here to rain on the parade. According to their latest forecast, U.S. stocks will deliver a measly 3% annualized return over the next decade. That’s a far cry from the gains of the past ten years, where tech giants like Nvidia and Apple led the charge. Goldman’s David Kostin and his team crunched the numbers and blamed sky-high valuations and an overly concentrated market. Right now, a small handful of mega-cap stocks hold the market together, but history shows it’s tough for companies to keep that kind of momentum going. In short, expect a major slowdown. **Bonds, Small Caps, and Equal Weight – Oh My!** So where’s the opportunity? Goldman suggests that bonds might actually outshine stocks in the next ten years—giving them a 72% chance to outperform. The equal-weight S&P 500 is another hot tip, since it spreads the love to smaller players, unlike the current market-weighted index that’s all about the big boys. Speaking of smaller players, small-cap stocks might be worth a look too—they tend to do well when the market’s top-heavy. **Not Just Goldman’s Gloom** Goldman’s not the only one predicting a bumpy road ahead. JPMorgan is a bit more optimistic, but still expects returns to be less than stellar, projecting about 6% for the next decade. Both banks agree on one thing: high inflation and inflated valuations are set to hold stocks back. So, if you’ve been banking on those double-digit gains sticking around, it might be time to rethink your strategy. In a nutshell, the “analysts” think the stock market is cooling off, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find ways to win—you just might need to play it a little differently. # # Market Movements * 📊 **Earnings Season Kicks Off with Major Players:** This week, 112 S&P 500 companies, including 7 Dow members, will release earnings, with Tesla, Coca-Cola, T-Mobile US, Verizon, and IBM leading the pack. * ✈️ **Boeing Reaches Tentative Deal to End Strike:** Boeing and its machinists union have reached a tentative contract deal after a 5-week strike.

($UBS) # # Disney will name Bob Iger’s replacement in early 2026 Bob Iger’s retirement saga continues! Disney announced it will name Iger’s successor in early 2026, pushing the date back once again. While Iger initially planned to hand over the reins by 2024, it seems like the Mouse House isn’t ready to let him go just yet. James Gorman, former Morgan Stanley CEO, will step in as board chairman in January, guiding the search for the next CEO. This extra time gives Disney more runway to evaluate candidates—both internal and external. But with Iger’s direct reports like ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro and Disney Experiences’ Josh D’Amaro already in the mix, the board has its hands full figuring out who gets to lead one of the world’s biggest entertainment companies. **Enter Gorman: The Succession Whisperer** Disney’s had a rocky road when it comes to CEO handoffs (remember the Bob Chapek debacle?). Now, with Gorman steering the board’s succession planning, investors are hoping for a smoother ride. Gorman’s experience in pulling off a seamless CEO transition at Morgan Stanley has earned him serious cred, and Disney is banking on that magic to avoid another leadership disaster. Gorman takes over from Nike Executive Chairman Mark Parker, who’s stepping down after a nine-year stint on the board. Some are saying Gorman’s outsider perspective might finally bring the fresh, independent leadership Disney’s board needs after being so closely tied to Iger for years. **Who’s Next in Line?** Four big names are in the running for Disney’s top job, and they’ve all had their turn in the hot seat. Josh D’Amaro, who oversees Disney’s theme parks and cruise lines, is one of the favorites. He’s got a solid public profile and is leading the company’s $60 billion park expansion. Meanwhile, Dana Walden has made waves in TV and streaming, but her limited experience in other divisions could hold her back. Then there’s Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN’s sports king, and Alan Bergman, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, who’s deeply embedded in Hollywood. Of course, there’s always a wildcard—an outside candidate waiting to swoop in. For now, Disney has plenty of time to decide, but whoever lands the role will have some massive shoes to fill. # # On The Horizon # Tomorrow Tomorrow’s one of those unicorn days in the economic world—no big announcements in sight. So take a breather and turn your attention to the real action: earnings season. # Before Market Open: * **General Motors** is cruising through a sales slump like many other automakers, but its stock has stayed in the fast lane this year. Higher profits, tighter cost controls, and a robust dividend and buyback program have kept investors happy. Now, shareholders are eager to hear how GM plans to keep the good times rolling, boost sales, and (fingers crossed) turn a profit in its EV division. The consensus? $2.43 EPS on $44.8 billion in revenue. ($GM)",8.193604879968516

The Nasdaq jumped 0.8% thanks to Tesla’s blowout earnings, while the S&P 500 managed to claw back a 0.2% gain after spending some time in the red. The Dow wasn’t as lucky, dropping 150 points, as IBM’s disappointing revenue weighed it down. * Tesla’s strong report fueled tech optimism, giving investors hope for a solid earnings season. But not everyone was celebrating—broader concerns over rising rates and sluggish earnings kept the Dow in the red for a fourth straight session. # # Winners & Losers # What’s up 📈 * **Tesla** surged 21.92% following the electric vehicle maker’s third-quarter profit beat. CEO Elon Musk forecasted that the company will see vehicle growth of 20% to 30% in 2025. ($TSLA) * **T-Mobile** delivered strong third-quarter results, beating analyst expectations for both revenue and profit. The telecommunications giant also provided an upbeat forecast, rising 5.71%.

($HON) # # Apple And Goldman Sachs Ordered To Pay more Than $89 Million For Apple Card Failures Apple’s reputation for intuitive design hit a snag with its Apple Card. Partnering with Goldman Sachs, Apple aimed to streamline credit card use, but the user experience didn't live up to expectations. The result? A hefty $89 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for mishandling consumer disputes and misleading customers about interest-free installment plans. The fines, split between Apple and Goldman, come after issues that affected thousands of Apple Card users, particularly around dispute resolution and installment payment options. **Where Apple Fell Short** At the heart of the problem was Apple's design for reporting billing errors. The process was supposed to be seamless, but many users were left frustrated when additional forms were required, and disputes weren’t properly sent to Goldman Sachs for investigation. On top of that, Apple’s checkout process confused customers by not making it clear they needed to opt into interest-free payments for Apple products. This led to unexpected interest charges for many. **Goldman’s Role in the Mess** Goldman Sachs didn’t escape the CFPB’s scrutiny either. The bank faced a slew of complaints over how it handled disputes once they were forwarded by Apple. Many disputes weren’t acknowledged within 30 days, and investigations often fell short of federal standards. The situation was worsened by Goldman’s failure to communicate how refunds and interest-free payments would work, leading some customers to rack up unnecessary interest. While both Apple and Goldman have taken steps to resolve these issues, this situation serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of over-promising simplicity in financial products. # # Market Movements * 💼 **Boeing workers extend strike:** Boeing machinists overwhelmingly rejected a new labor deal, prolonging a strike that has stalled most aircraft production for over a month. The deal included a 35% wage increase and enhanced retirement contributions, but union members remained unsatisfied.

The coffee chain reported a 7% drop in same-store sales for Q3, marking the third consecutive quarterly decline. Niccol is focused on simplifying the menu and improving operations, but has a long road ahead, especially in China where competition from local chains is growing. * 🥤 **Keurig Dr Pepper makes a splash:** Keurig Dr Pepper is acquiring energy-drink maker Ghost for over $1B, marking its largest deal since its 2018 purchase of Dr Pepper Snapple. ($KDP) * 👓 **Apple cuts Vision Pro production:** Apple has significantly reduced production of its Vision Pro headset and may stop production of the current model by year-end, as it shifts focus toward developing more affordable versions.

($NVO) # # TKO Group To Acquire 3 Businesses From Endeavor For $3.25 billion TKO Group, the owner of UFC and WWE, just went shopping—and they didn’t hold back. In a $3.25 billion all-stock deal, TKO is scooping up three sports-related businesses from Endeavor Group: Professional Bull Riders (PBR), On Location, and IMG. Not only does this bolster TKO’s portfolio, but it also pushes Endeavor’s ownership stake in the company from 53% to a commanding 59%. The deal isn’t just about grabbing new leagues. TKO’s getting a piece of the action in premium hospitality (On Location) and sports media rights (IMG). This move positions them as a heavyweight not only in sports leagues but in everything from ticket sales to media strategy. Sounds like TKO is aiming for a bigger slice of the sports entertainment pie. **TKO's Stock Buyback and Dividends: Sweet Deal for Investors** Along with the big buy, TKO is treating its shareholders to a little extra love. The company announced plans to buy back up to $2 billion in stock and kick off quarterly dividends of $75 million. That's a solid move considering TKO's cash-generating capabilities, and it sends a clear signal: they’re serious about rewarding their investors. TKO’s shares took a dip following the news, sliding 5.9% in early trading, but the long-term play seems geared toward solid growth. With UFC and WWE already under their belt, adding PBR and IMG only deepens TKO’s stronghold on live sports and media rights. **What’s Next for TKO?** As TKO’s President, Mark Shapiro, pointed out, this is no small acquisition. PBR hosts over 200 events a year, while On Location is known for luxe packages at major sports spectacles like the Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup. IMG, on the other hand, is a major player in media rights deals for everything from the NFL to the English Premier League. That means TKO is moving beyond just operating leagues—they’re stepping into a full-scale sports entertainment empire. No more shopping from Endeavor, though—at least for now. Shapiro made it clear that TKO’s not looking to buy more assets from its parent company. But as Endeavor goes private, TKO seems primed to snatch up other opportunities in the sports and entertainment world, positioning themselves as a giant in the industry. # # On The Horizon # Tomorrow The week fizzled out without much action on the economic front. Durable goods—think cars, washing machines, and industrial robots (maybe) —are the heavy hitters of the manufacturing world. Tracking orders for these big-ticket items gives us a snapshot of how businesses are feeling about their future. Are they investing in long-term assets, or tightening the purse strings? Economists are predicting a 1% drop in orders this month, a sign that the manufacturing sector is still stuck in a rut after last month’s flat performance. Looks like the industry's struggle bus isn’t pulling into the station just yet.",7.186431241549352

195,2024-10-30 16:33:14,Brave-Hedgehog-1834,Risk % to include PDT minimum?,"For US based traders, with the 25k PDT restriction: TL;DR: I have a 1% daily max loss of account, divided by 10, for a 0.1% risked per trade, just so i get enough screen time before maxing out for the day. Do you set your max daily risk % according to your overall account balance, or just the capital you have above the 25k PDT requirement? Ok, on to the more long winded post: I'm in my 2nd horrible month (almost 2months with mostly red days) daytrading stocks on demo with the DAS platform. I MAY feasibly be able to actually have 30K usd to trade with in a year or 2. Potentially more, but i want to start real slow. So i set my demo account to 30k. My actual broker (which ive never actually used) is an IBKR margin account with $1 fee per order. When calculating position size/stop loss for a 1% max daily loss of my account, that's $50. When i hit $50 loss, i quit for the day. Why $50? Because i figure i should trade on my capital OVER the 25k PDT rule so if I blow it, im not in the hole 25k and have to make that all back just to daytrade again. Following SMBC's Mike Bellafiore's rules, i also should allow for 10 consecutive losses before i hit that max daily loss of $50. Just to ensure i can still get enough screen time. So that's a $5 loss per trade. I tried that for a day, and the commissions were overwhelming with such small profits. So i usually do $10 risk per trade. But I still suck and am hitting my max daily loss a lot of days after only 5 trades. Im also tryna trade megacaps like TSLA and NVDA lately becasue i was getting absolutely demolished on slippage tryna play momo stonks a la Ross Cameron style. So obviously these expensive stocks are hard to play with such small risk capital. So do you set your risk % according to your overall account balance, or just the capital you have above the 25k PDT requirement? So far ive lost $1000 of that 5k this morning, and im wondering if my risk is too small, for the commisions i pay.",-2.0299145299145303

Really, was better than expected imo. * the only reaosn its down is ebcause it was trading at 35x earnings. Thats why we are seeing analysts UPGRADING their price targets on it. They actually think the earnings IMPROVED their outlook on it. I think this could be true as it has helped to remove some of the cloud over their iphone numbers. * Interest in apple intelligence is actually strong right now, which alleviates a lot fo the concerns around Apple * Gradual rollout may mean that it is hard to know how future sales will be which is a problem in trying to come up with a valuation for the company. * Services were strong * Better than expected earnigns in my opinion. * Is only down because its trading at 35x earnings, AMZN: # Takeaways: * Absolutely massive beat on EPS 1.43 vs 1.16. * FOCUSING ON AI: * Expects FY24 CapEx around $75B—primarily for AWS and generative AI.

It’s scaling more than three times faster at this stage than AWS did in its early days. ""We felt like AWS grew pretty quickly."" * ""considerable upside"" in ad revenue, with AWS as the ""partner of choice."" Generative AI is used ""pervasively"" across its business and devices. * international unit is on track for record profit this fiscal year—its 2nd profitable year since 2014. * Some analysts also project profits from this segment could top $5B next year, driven by improved warehouse and delivery systems in key markets like Germany and the UK. * AMZN even says that their chips are doing well as some customers are saying that NVDA chips are a bit expensive. Aggressive push into chips continues. # My take: * The lack of dividend/buyback announcement was a bit disappointing. However, the earnings were v strong across the board * AWS was awesome - growing extremely quickly. Ad revenue side of business is doing exceptionally well * Well positioned in ecommerce, higher volumes pointed to. * AWS is evolving to accommodate GEnAI and their CAPEX will support them in long run.

203,2024-11-04 17:00:15,Virtual_Information3,"Stock Market Today: Buffett Is Sitting On $300 Billion + Palantir Reports Record Profit, Cites ‘Unwavering’ AI Demand","* Stocks took a tumble on Monday, as pre-election jitters and a possible Fed rate cut had investors in a frenzy. All three major indexes danced up and down before closing in the red—Dow down 257 points (0.61%), while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq slipped 0.28% and 0.33%. * It was a choppy day all around, as investors braced for a wild week of market-moving events. With the election and Fed’s decision on deck, it’s safe to say the market rollercoaster is far from over. # # Winners & Losers # What’s up 📈 * **Globalstar** surged 31.88% after Apple committed approximately $1.5 billion to support its satellite communication expansion for iPhone services. ($GSAT) * **Chewy** rose 6.34% after S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that it would replace Stericycle in the S&P MidCap 400, effective Wednesday. ($CHWY) * **Sherwin-Williams** increased 4.59% as its addition to the Dow boosted the materials sector weighting, while the technology sector’s influence in the Dow also shifted. ($SHW) * **Peloton** climbed 3.59% following an upgrade to “buy” from “underperform” by Bank of America, which is optimistic about earnings growth under new CEO Peter Stern. ($PTON) * **Exxon Mobil** rose 3.18% despite reporting Q3 earnings of $8.61 billion, down 4.4% year-over-year, as production reached a 40-year high of 4.6 million barrels per day. ($XOM) * **eBay** gained 3.65%. ($EBAY) * **First Solar** ticked up 3.58%. ($FSLR) # What’s down 📉 * **Constellation Energy** dropped 12.46% as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected Talen Energy's request to boost power output from the Susquehanna nuclear plant for an Amazon data center. The market anticipated similar deals from Constellation and Vistra, contributing to the decline.

($SNAP) # # Berkshire Hathaway’s Cash Fortress Tops $300 Billion Warren Buffett’s cash stash at Berkshire Hathaway is looking more like a cash fortress, ballooning to a record-breaking $325 billion. It’s a fortune even Buffett isn’t sure how to spend, as he keeps dodging big-ticket buys and instead cashes out on old faves like Apple and Bank of America. Why the hoarding? Some say he’s just too seasoned to overpay in today’s market; others think he’s plotting something big. Either way, he’s showing us what real self-control looks like. **Apple on a Diet, Cash on a Bulk-Up** Buffett trimmed Berkshire’s Apple stake by another 25% this quarter, whittling it down to $69.9 billion. Even though the iPhone maker still holds the crown as Berkshire’s biggest holding, it’s clear Buffett’s leaning out the tech exposure. The kicker? This isn’t a tech-love breakup, just a careful rebalancing to make sure Apple doesn’t end up becoming the whole show. **Buybacks? Not This Time** Usually, Buffett’s all about scooping up his own shares when Berkshire’s cash pile is high, but this quarter, buybacks took a timeout. And that’s surprising, given Berkshire’s been on a 25% winning streak this year. Analysts speculate he’s holding out for the *really* right moment to jump back in—because why not, when cash is stacking up faster than Wall Street can blink? **Cash-Burning Dreams:** So, what’s next for Buffett’s billions? Will he finally splurge on something big, like a mega-acquisition? Or is he playing the long game, waiting for stock prices to cool off before making any serious moves? One thing’s clear: the Oracle of Omaha knows patience is a virtue—and he’s got the cash mountain to prove it. # # Market Movements * **📡 Apple Commits $1.5B to Globalstar for Satellite Expansion:** Apple has invested $1.5 billion into Globalstar to expand iPhone satellite services, including a $1.1 billion cash commitment and a 20% equity stake, prompting Globalstar’s stock to jump over 30%. ($AAPL, $GSAT) * ✈️ **Boeing Machinists Vote on New Contract:** Today, Boeing’s 32,000 machinists are casting their votes on a newly proposed contract, which includes a 38% wage increase over the next four years—a substantial boost following previous offers that were turned down. ($BA) * **🇨🇳 Tesla’s China Sales Dip as Model Deliveries Slow:** Tesla reported a 5.3% drop in sales of its China-made electric vehicles for October, with the monthly deliveries of Model 3 and Model Y down 22.7%, signaling a cooling demand in a key EV market. ($TSLA) * 🇪🇺 **EU to Review Apple’s Compliance with New Digital Markets Act:** The European Union will evaluate whether Apple’s iPad OS aligns with the Digital Markets Act, which could require Apple to offer users a choice in default browsers and allow access to third-party app stores. ($AAPL) * 🍟 **Wendy’s to Close 140 Locations with Plans for New Openings:** Wendy’s has announced it will close 140 underperforming locations but plans to open a similar number of new restaurants in stronger markets as part of a larger strategy to modernize and grow. ($WEN) * ⚖️ **Meta and Nvidia Appeal Securities Fraud Cases to Supreme Court:** Meta and Nvidia are petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to dismiss securities fraud cases against them, arguing that recent rulings limiting regulatory powers could set new legal precedents for investor lawsuits. ($META, $NVDA) * 📉 **Investors Shift to Bonds as Stock Market Caution Increases:** U.S. equity funds saw $5.83 billion in outflows this past week as investors adopt a more cautious stance ahead of the election and the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision, while bond funds gained a strong $7.37 billion in inflows. # Palantir Reports Record Profit, Cites ‘Unwavering’ AI Demand Palantir just dropped a knockout earnings report, sending its stock up 15% after hours. Revenue shot up 30% in Q3 to $725.5 million, leaving analysts' forecasts in the dust. But the real kicker? Demand for Palantir’s AI tech in the U.S. is off the charts, setting the company up for a stellar year with a new revenue target of nearly $2.81 billion. **The U.S. Appetite for AI** Business is booming stateside, with commercial revenue up 54% and government revenue climbing 40% year-over-year. CEO Alex Karp didn’t hold back, describing this as “unwavering demand” that’s positioning Palantir front and center in an AI-powered revolution. The U.S. government’s appetite for advanced data tools is a big driver, making Palantir’s AI solutions essential for organizations seeking smarter, more efficient operations. **Boosted Guidance Lights Up Investors** With a solid quarter under its belt, Palantir has raised its guidance, now expecting full-year revenue to land between $2.805 and $2.809 billion—well above Wall Street’s estimates. Q4’s forecast looks equally strong, with revenue projected as high as $771 million. Given AI’s moment in the spotlight, investors are betting on Palantir’s long-term potential in this high-stakes arena. **Global Hiccups, U.S. Dominance** While the U.S. powers Palantir’s growth, international sales are a mixed bag, particularly in Europe, where commercial revenue slipped this quarter. Yet Karp remains optimistic, seeing the U.S. as the core of Palantir’s AI growth. As these tools become integral across industries, Palantir’s strong domestic foothold could keep it leading the pack, even as it navigates a few global bumps. # # On The Horizon # Tomorrow Two economic reports are due tomorrow—the ISM Services Index and a snapshot of the U.S. Trade Deficit. But, let’s face it, neither will come close to stealing the spotlight from the presidential election. Election night means noise, lots of it. And with every update and needle movement, it’s tempting to hit the panic button. But seasoned investors know the real trick: tuning out the chaos and sticking to their strategy. Here’s the game plan—keep calm, keep steady. The ones who make it big aren’t the ones glued to every election twist but those who play the long game, staying true to their plan no matter what. # Before Market Open: * **Ferrari** has been cruising on pure brand power. While most of the luxury market is slowing down, Ferrari’s ultra-wealthy customers barely feel the pinch, happily shelling out for a supercar that hits 0-60 in just 2.4 seconds. With a waiting list that stretches well into the future, Ferrari’s got smooth sailing for months, and management will likely be popping the champagne tomorrow to toast another year of market-beating gains. Consensus: $2.19 EPS, $1.79 billion in revenue. ($RACE) # After Market Close: * Meanwhile, **Super Micro Computer** has found itself in hot water. A damning short-seller report, a DOJ investigation, and the sudden exit of its independent auditor have all hit within weeks. Investors are expecting answers in tomorrow's earnings call, but clarity? That might be harder to come by. Consensus: at this point, who really knows? ($SMCI)",9.466832504145938

205,2024-11-06 10:30:50,Dangerous-Time-7819,I have a capital of $100. How do I trade/enter & Should I risk around 5% on stocks like these?,"My scanner runs for stocks <$20, relative volume pretty high, and >10% change. Although I faced a problem attempting to trade those stocks; The market is either very sideways, unpredictable, gains/loses slowly. (I’m aware that’s how 80% of the stocks work) So, the question is as a very small account beginner, should I take the trade on these types of stocks or pass them and find very volatile penny stocks with an uptrend as I only have a strategy for this condition? And if You were to take those trades, how would you go about doing so? I’m trying to expand my strategy on entries for these specific type of stocks but have no clue how. Am I being too ambitious? Unrealistic? Thanks guys.",3.987179487179489
206,2024-11-06 17:18:22,Virtual_Information3,Stock Market Today: Trump Trade Is Back + Prediction Markets Are Having Their Moment,"* Stocks were on fire Wednesday as Donald Trump’s victory spurred a massive market rally. The Dow skyrocketed more than 1,500 points in a single session, making it its best day since 2022, while the S&P 500 charged up 2.53% to top 5,929. Not to be outdone, the Nasdaq added nearly 3%, with all three indexes ending the day at record highs. * But stocks weren’t the only thing moving. The dollar got a boost, and Treasury prices took a hit as investors doubled down on a potential Trump-led economic overhaul. From tariffs to taxes, Wall Street was all in on policies they expect to reshape the economic landscape, sending waves through stocks, bonds, and currencies alike. # # Winners & Losers # What’s up 📈 * **Coinbase** surged 31.11% on speculation that a Trump presidency would foster a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrency. ($COIN) * **Discover Financial Services** gained 20.22% as investors anticipated looser regulations under a Trump administration, potentially paving the way for more mergers and acquisitions in the banking sector. ($DFS) * **CVS Health** soared 11.33% after surpassing Q3 revenue expectations with $95.43 billion, above the $92.75 billion forecast, though its adjusted earnings of $1.09 per share missed estimates of $1.51 per share. ($CVS) * **Planet Fitness** increased 6.12% after reports surfaced that it is interested in acquiring the bankrupt budget-fitness chain Blink Holdings. ($PLNT) * **Alphabet** (Google) rose 3.99% on expectations that a Trump presidency could reduce regulatory pressures on Big Tech, potentially easing antitrust scrutiny. ($GOOGL) * **Amazon** gained 3.80% for similar reasons, as a Trump return to the White House could lead to a lighter regulatory stance on tech giants. ($AMZN) * **Robinhood** rose 19.63%. ($HOOD) * **Palantir** climbed 8.61%. ($PLTR) # What’s down 📉 * **Super Micro Computer** plunged 18.05% after issuing Q4 revenue guidance between $5.5 billion and $6.1 billion, below analysts’ expectations. The company’s adjusted EPS outlook also missed forecasts, and it remains uncertain when it will file its annual results, though it is working to resolve reporting delays. ($SMCI) * **Enphase Energy** dropped 16.82% as clean energy stocks broadly declined amid speculation that a Trump presidency could lead to a rollback of industry reforms, potentially including the repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act. ($ENPH) * **Philip Morris** declined 5.20% despite a potentially favorable outlook for tobacco stocks under a Trump administration, with the possibility of reversing Biden’s proposed menthol cigarette ban. ($PM) * **Nike** slipped 3.41% on concerns that Trump’s proposed tariffs could increase footwear costs, impacting companies like Nike and Walmart. ($NKE) * **Rivian** fell 8.31%. ($RIVN) * **Mattel** declined 6.98%. ($MAT) * **Zillow** slid 6.56%. ($Z) # # The Trump Trade Is So Back With the confetti barely settled, Wall Street is jumping on the ""Trump Trade"" bandwagon, cheering on the promise of tax cuts, deregulation, and a whole lot of American-made everything. After Trump’s decisive win, investors seem ready to party like it’s 2017 all over again, driving stocks higher in celebration. **Stocks Soaring, Banks Roaring** In true Trump style, the biggest winners were unsurprising: Trump Media & Technology Group ticked up 6%, and Tesla shot up a whopping 15% as Elon Musk fans speculated his next role could come with a White House Cabinet badge. B anks were also in for a big day with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo seeing double-digit gains—investors banking on lighter regulations are here for the ride. Crypto fans are grinning ear-to-ear as Bitcoin hit a new high at $76,000, with Ethereum and Coinbase riding the wave of Trump’s pledge to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” And oil’s back in play, with fossil-fuel giants like Exxon enjoying a lighter-touch regulatory future. **Clean Energy, Not So Much:** Not every sector is feeling the love. Green energy stocks like First Solar and Enphase Energy took a beating, down 10% and more, with the Invesco Solar ETF trailing alongside. Investors are worried Trump’s clean energy cuts could halt momentum for solar and wind. **Bonds, the Dollar, and All That Jazz:** Treasury yields popped as bondholders braced for a more inflationary, debt-ridden policy path. And the dollar? It’s on a tear, seeing its biggest gain since 2020 as a higher tariff policy puts a chill on imports, boosting the greenback. **The Bottom Line:** While Wall Street’s in a post-election high, the experts are wary. Veteran investor Leon Cooperman warned that traders might be “too optimistic,” and some analysts say it could be short-lived. For now, the “Trump Trade” seems full steam ahead, but as always in markets, it’s best to keep one hand on the exit. # # Market Movements * **👓 Apple Explores Smart Glasses:** Apple is reportedly running internal studies on “Atlas,” a smart glasses project as it considers entering the market to compete with Meta. ($AAPL, $META) * 📱 **Walmart Trials New Anti-Theft Tech:** Walmart is piloting a phone-based app for employees to unlock security cases, potentially expanding it to Walmart+ members to enhance theft prevention and customer experience.

($NVDA, $AAPL) * ⚡ **Tesla Surges on Trump Win:** Tesla’s stock jumped nearly 15% premarket as investors expect Trump's win to benefit major supporter Elon Musk, though it could impact EV subsidies. ($TSLA) * 💰 **Crypto Hits Record Highs:** Bitcoin surged to $75,600, fueled by hopes for crypto-friendly regulations under the new administration. Coinbase and other crypto-linked stocks rallied alongside it.

With bets pouring in as high as 70% for Trump on some platforms, it seems political markets may just be stealing the predictive spotlight. Prediction markets are officially having a moment. Platforms like Kalshi, Polymarket, and even Robinhood are diving into event-based trading, allowing users to bet on anything from presidential outcomes to rainfall odds. For Wall Street pros and everyday bettors alike, these markets offer a new way to speculate—and maybe even profit—on real-world events. The appeal? While traditional investments hinge on long-term trends, event-based trading lets users cash in on predictions in real-time, giving them a front-row seat to high-stakes, headline-driven market moves. **Trump Odds Surge, Betting Markets Get Serious** The betting markets were on fire leading up to the election, with millions poured into wagers across various platforms. Kalshi, the only legal site for U.S. election betting, saw over $250 million in wagers, but Polymarket, the grey-market crypto platform, took it to the next level with over $3 billion in bets. Robinhood even joined the game, rolling out election contracts a week before the final votes were counted. Clearly, everyone’s trying to cash in on this new political betting boom. **The Winners, Losers, and Future of Election Betting** On the winning side? Tesla, Bitcoin, and Trump Media all enjoyed post-election bumps. But this newfound love for political markets has the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) eyeing tougher regulations. They’re worried that this craze for betting on real-world events could be too risky for the average trader. So, for now, betting markets are riding high, basking in the glow of their big election night win. Whether they’ll continue this streak without regulation raining on their parade? Only time (and a lot of bets) will tell. # # On The Horizon # Tomorrow Tomorrow’s lineup starts with initial jobless claims—aka, the latest pulse check on how many folks are filing for unemployment. It’s a big deal for the Fed’s next rate move, though by the time these numbers hit, Jerome Powell and the crew will be locked in on their decision. So, what’s the verdict? Analysts are betting hard on a 0.25% rate cut, and markets seem to agree, pricing in the odds of a trim at a cool 99.6%. It’s a smaller dip than the one in September, but that’s the Fed keeping things steady. The labor market’s been flexing some strength lately, so no need for the summer’s panic-fueled, jumbo-sized cuts. But don’t get too hung up on the rate cut itself. Eyes should be on Powell’s press conference later in the day. The man’s words and the Fed’s follow-up chatter could tell us a whole lot more about their game plan for the months ahead. # Before Market Open: * **Planet Fitness** banks on members who sign up, then conveniently forget to show up. But the FTC’s new “Click-to-Cancel” rule could make those “set-it-and-forget-it” memberships harder to hold onto. The rule, aimed at simplifying cancellations, is still under legal review, so the company’s stock hasn’t taken a hit just yet. But if this rule sticks, Planet Fitness might need a new game plan to keep revenue pumping. Analysts forecast $0.58 EPS and $285.87 million in revenue. ($PLNT) # After Market Close: * **Pinterest** has been on a wild ride lately—a strong spring, followed by a tough summer slump thanks to lackluster guidance that sent shares tumbling. But now, with the stock looking relatively cheap, investors are tuning in to see if AI can be the growth engine Pinterest needs. All eyes are on management’s plans for AI-powered user engagement and revenue growth. Wall Street expects $0.34 EPS and revenue of $896.31 million. ($PINS)",13.935729746444034

The day started, I had no patience for anything, I felt invincible and as opposed to trading SPY like I normally do, or better yet, recognize and act on the fact that I wasn’t feeling it that day, my brain manipulated me into NVDA after it broke resistance, as opposed to my edge, of waiting for the retest to jump in, but NVDA would not slow down here, wouldn’t it? Well, guess what… it retested and broke down, I kept averaging down (another red flag) and kept on holding until I gave up and closed the trade. That day, was Oct 7, 2024, another financially painful lesson in the world of trading. Believe it not, I actually ended the day feeling great, realizing that it’s a great opportunity to re-prove myself that the edge I have isn’t a fruit of my imagination.

But Fed Chair Jerome Powell threw some cold water on the rally, suggesting the economy’s strength means no rush on rate cuts. * By the end, the Dow dipped 207 points, the S&P slid 0.6%, and the Nasdaq dropped 0.64%. Powell’s “wait and see” stance left investors questioning how much juice is left in this rally as inflation pressures linger. # # Winners & Losers # What’s up 📈 * **Burberry** soared 17.93% after its CEO announced a turnaround plan to address the brand’s recent decline.

($DJT) * **Tesla** slid 5.77% following reports that the Trump transition team is planning to end the EV tax credit. ($TSLA) * **Lockheed Martin** dropped 3.36%. ($LMT) # # Vaccine Stocks Catch a Cold on Kennedy's Nomination Vaccine stocks felt the pain Thursday after President-elect Trump tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal vaccine skeptic, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). With Kennedy’s track record of challenging vaccine safety, investors quickly hit sell on big names. Moderna ($MRNA) slid 5.6%, Novavax ($NVAX) lost 7%, while Pfizer ($PFE) and BioNTech ($BNTX) joined the red tide. The market’s verdict? Kennedy’s policies could shake up the sector, potentially eroding public confidence and tightening regulations. **Uncertain Times for Vaccine Makers** For an industry already coping with waning COVID-19 vaccine demand, Kennedy’s HHS role injects new uncertainty. His anti-vaccine advocacy—and leadership of Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vax group—has industry players and investors bracing for possible policy headwinds. Vaccine manufacturers now face the risk of reduced immunization rates, which could pressure their bottom lines even further. **Biotech Takes Note** Kennedy’s views extend beyond vaccines, casting a shadow over the wider biotech sector. With his skepticism about pharmaceutical companies, market watchers anticipate potential shifts in health policy that could impact drug development, approval timelines, and sales. Analysts are on alert, viewing Kennedy’s influence as a wildcard that could affect drugmakers’ performance across the board. **Stock Market Reaction** The market is clearly concerned, and health stocks could be in for a bumpy ride if Kennedy’s nomination is confirmed. With his anti-establishment approach, the biotech and vaccine sectors might see a heightened level of volatility, as investors weigh the long-term effects of Kennedy’s potential policy pivots on the healthcare landscape. # # Market Movements * **🗣️ Powell Signals Patience on Rate Cuts:** Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that strong U.S. economic growth allows policymakers to take their time on interest rate cuts. Powell highlighted resilience in the labor market and gradual progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target. Stocks dipped following his comments, as traders adjusted December rate cut expectations. ($SPX) * **⚡ Tesla Stock Drops as Trump Trade Cools:** Tesla shares declined 5.7% amid reports suggesting that the Trump administration may cut EV tax credits. The company also issued a sixth Cybertruck recall due to a faulty component, adding pressure on the stock. CEO Elon Musk, a Trump supporter, has advocated for deregulation in the auto sector. ($TSLA) * **📺 Network Viewership Shifts Post-Election:** MSNBC's prime-time viewership dropped 53% since Trump's election win, while Fox News experienced a 21% audience surge, indicating contrasting viewer reactions post-election. ($CMCSA, $FOXA) * 🥪 **Lunchables Dropped from School Lunches:** Kraft Heinz is pulling Lunchables from the National School Lunch Program following concerns about sodium and heavy metals found in school-specific versions. The impact on sales is minimal, as these versions represent less than 1% of total sales. ($KHC) * 📄 **Klarna Moves Toward U.S. IPO:** Klarna, the Swedish payments company, has filed for a U.S. IPO, marking a rebound from previous valuation dips. Specific share details and pricing remain under wraps. * 📈 **ASML Stays Confident with 2030 Forecast:** ASML’s stock climbed over 3% after it reaffirmed its 2030 sales guidance of $46.5B-$63.4B, fueled by AI chip demand despite slowdowns in other sectors. ($ASML) * 📈 **Foxconn Profits Surge on AI Server Demand:** Foxconn, a supplier for Apple and Nvidia, reported a 14% increase in Q3 net profit to $1.52B, reaching record revenue of $56.88B, largely due to a 200% rise in AI server sales. The company expects AI servers to account for over half of its server revenue by 2025. ($SHA:601138, $AAPL, $NVDA) * 🤖 **AMD’s Strategic Layoffs:** AMD announced a 4% workforce reduction, cutting around 1,000 employees to focus resources on AI, competing directly with Nvidia’s lead. Despite growth in AI chip sales, AMD's stock trails behind Nvidia’s year-to-date gains. ($AMD, $NVDA) # # Disney Surges On Streaming Growth Disney posted a strong Q4, crediting streaming wins and blockbuster hits for a 6% revenue rise, landing at $22.57 billion. Bob Iger, back in the driver’s seat, forecasted earnings growth in the high single digits for 2025, with double-digit jumps through 2027. That news sent Disney’s stock up 9%—a glimmer of magic in an otherwise challenging media landscape. # Streaming Soars, Cable Sinks Disney+ and friends (Hulu and ESPN+) notched a solid $321 million in profit, even adding 4.4 million new subscribers as its ad-supported tier gained traction. Meanwhile, cable kept sliding, with revenue down 38% in a quarter where cord-cutting hit hard. It’s clear: streaming is Disney’s leading role now, as cable fades into the background. # The Box Office Magic Lives On Thanks to *Inside Out 2* and *Deadpool & Wolverine*, Disney’s studio turned in $316 million in quarterly profits, with both films setting records. As Disney eyes the holiday box office with *Moana 2* and *Mufasa*, the studio’s on track to remain a top profit machine, contributing to a 14% jump in entertainment revenue. # Parks Keep Rolling Amid Storms Theme parks felt the squeeze from rising costs and lower international attendance, but domestic parks held their own with solid guest spending. Disney forecasts 6-8% growth for the parks in 2025, banking on upcoming expansions to keep the magic alive for tourists, even as international foot traffic takes a breather. # # On The Horizon # Tomorrow The economic lineup eases up as we head into the weekend, but all eyes are on U.S. Retail Sales. This monthly Commerce Department report breaks down spending trends across everything from gadgets to cars. Last month’s numbers beat expectations, so economists are hoping for a repeat as we gear up for the holiday shopping rush. # Before Market Open: * Alibaba’s fortunes are tied to China’s shaky economy, and while government stimulus gave the stock a jolt in October, investors know that can’t be the whole game plan. They’ll be looking for management to outline how they’ll drive international growth and expand beyond retail. Wall Street’s calling for $2.10 EPS on $33.95 billion in revenue, so it’s time for Alibaba to show what’s next. ($BABA)",6.7499278499278486

($MRNA, $PFE, $BNTX) # # Netflix’s Heavyweight Gamble: Tyson vs. Paul **A Punch at Streaming’s Future** Netflix is stepping into uncharted territory ~~tonight~~ right now as it streams a high-profile boxing match between 58-year-old Mike Tyson and 27-year-old influencer Jake Paul. While the spectacle promises millions of viewers, it’s also a trial run for Netflix’s live-streaming chops ahead of broadcasting two NFL games on Christmas Day. For a platform that once dismissed live sports, this is a pivotal moment to prove it can handle the pressure—or risk being knocked out of the game. **Betting Big on Live Events** This fight isn’t just about punches—it’s about ad dollars. Of Netflix’s 283 million subscribers, 70 million are on the ad-supported tier, offering prime real estate for advertisers during live events. If the Tyson-Paul bout performs well, Netflix could command premium ad rates, mirroring the cable TV playbook. With live NFL broadcasts already sold out, Netflix is betting on its ability to leverage sports content for future growth. **Streaming vs. Traditional Sports Networks** The event also marks a shift in boxing’s media landscape. Once dominated by HBO and Showtime, the sport is now migrating to streaming platforms like Netflix, DAZN, and Amazon Prime. Tyson and Paul’s fight is Netflix’s way of signaling its intent to compete in live sports broadcasting, even as it diversifies with long-term deals like the WWE’s *Raw*and the NFL’s holiday matchups. **The Real Test:** While the buzz around the fight is undeniable, the real winner tonight could be Netflix—or not. If the platform falters under the strain of millions of viewers, it could undermine confidence in its ability to handle future live events. But if Netflix pulls off a seamless broadcast, it will solidify its place as a new heavyweight in the live sports arena, setting up a much larger bout: its battle against traditional sports networks. # S # Market Movements * 📈 **Palantir Jumps 11% to Record High:** Palantir shares surged 11% on news that the company will transfer its stock listing to the Nasdaq from the NYSE. This continues a strong run for the company, with shares up 45% since its recent earnings beat. ($PLTR) * 🚀 **Space Stocks Soar Amid Post-Election Rally:** Space-focused companies saw major gains this week, with Rocket Lab climbing 41%, Intuitive Machines up 28%, and Spire Global gaining 26%. Analysts attribute the rally partly to optimism surrounding a Trump administration expected to prioritize space initiatives. ($RKLB) ($SPIR) * 🌌 **Musk’s SpaceX Plans $135/Share Tender Offer:** SpaceX is preparing a tender offer in December at $135 per share, valuing the company at over $250 billion. With Trump’s election, Musk’s influence could shift national priorities to focus more on Mars and space exploration. * 🇪🇺 **Meta's E.U. Troubles Deepen:** The European Union fined Meta $840 million for integrating its Marketplace into Facebook, allegedly disadvantaging rival classified services. Meta plans to appeal the fine and has also cut European ad-free subscription prices for Facebook and Instagram by 40% to comply with regulations. ($META) * ⚖️ **Musk Adds Microsoft to AI Lawsuit:** Elon Musk expanded his lawsuit against OpenAI to include Microsoft and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman, alleging that their partnership unfairly stifled competition and harmed Musk’s xAI.

Its stock has gained 38% year-to-date. ($HLT) # # Meta To Face Us Antitrust Trial Over Acquisitions Of Instagram and Whatsapp Meta’s decade-old acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp are finally getting their day in court. A federal judge ruled that the FTC’s antitrust lawsuit against Meta will go to trial, alleging that the company overpaid for these platforms to eliminate competition. If the FTC wins, Meta could be forced to part ways with its prized assets, reshaping the social media landscape. However, Meta scored a minor victory with one claim—relating to access for third-party developers—dismissed. **Regulators Everywhere, All at Once** The hits don’t stop there for Meta. The European Union just slapped the company with an €798 million ($840 million) fine, claiming Facebook Marketplace unfairly leveraged its dominance in social networking to outmuscle rivals. Meta says it’ll appeal, but the penalty adds to a growing list of regulatory headaches that have investors questioning Big Tech’s resilience. **What’s at Stake?** Meta’s empire is under siege. A breakup of Instagram and WhatsApp would mean a significant shift in its revenue streams and market power. Meanwhile, fines and lawsuits across the globe are hitting the balance sheet. For a company already navigating fierce competition from TikTok and others, the uncertainty around regulatory outcomes could stymie its future growth. **A Global Reckoning for Big Tech** Meta isn’t alone in the hot seat. Antitrust cases against Amazon, Google, and Apple are ramping up, marking a bipartisan push to rein in tech monopolies. The stakes are high: these trials will set the tone for how governments worldwide handle Big Tech, creating ripple effects across the sector. Investors, brace yourselves—this is just the beginning. # # On The Horizon # Next Week Next week’s shaping up to be all about housing, with the home builder confidence index kicking things off Monday, housing starts dropping Tuesday, and existing home sales wrapping it up Thursday.

It now appears to be dropping more and more every day and my question is this: do you guys think I should hold it for the long term, OR should I sell it now, accept the ~$3 loss, and then buy in again when it drop to the mid $50s and then hold?

225,2016-09-18 18:08:51,erichisalurker,NVDA DD feel free to critique,"Nvidia’s foundational revenue stream is in its gaming-oriented PC GPU products. Despite diversification into other market segments, this product division remains the largest revenue-generator for Nvidia. Over the last six quarters, gaming-related products have accounted for more than 50% of sales revenue for the company. However, this relative share of revenue has declined as Nvidia has expanded into other product areas. Since their Q1 2016 report (4-26-2015), revenue streams from Datacenter and Automotive products have increased by 71.6% and 54.55% respectively. Nvidia also generates a significant portion of its revenues from Professional Visualization and OEM & IP products as well. Combined, these segments represent roughly 25% of Nvidia’s revenue. It is worth noting that over the last six quarters the revenue generated from OEM & IP products has declined 25.22% while the revenue from Professional Visualization products has increased by 18.2% Regionally, Nvidia still derives most of its revenue from the Asia Pacific markets. In Q2 2017 (7-31-2016), revenue in the Asia Pacific region accounted for 66.67% of overall revenue. This is compared to 14.42% from the US, 11.69% from Europe, and 7.21% from Other Americas. There has been stable revenue growth from every region over the last six quarters, keeping in line with the growth in overall revenue. The largest regional growth can be seen in the Asia Pacific and United States regions, indicating improving consumer demand in both of these areas. Having recognized the declines in relative revenue generation from video game segments, Nvidia has shifted their focus moving forward to larger-scale, more innovative market segments. At Nvidia’s GTC China 2017 presentation, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang highlighted the massive impact that deep learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will have on the world in the coming years. Nvidia seeks to push the boundaries of AI and deep learning technologies, and their first step is with their new GPU architecture, Pascal. Nvidia’s latest line of GPUs for both consumer and commercial use have been hailed as the best performing processors on the market. Furthermore, during the Q2 2017 earnings call, Huang reiterated his belief that deep learning is going to be the company’s most significant growth driver moving forward. Nvidia has very recently procured a contract with Chinese web company Baidu to develop AI platforms for their self-driving cars, adding their name to a client list which already includes industry leaders such as Tesla and BMW. A recent Bank of America forecast suggested that the deep learning and AI market could reach $153 billion by 2020, and Nvidia already has a strong position in the industry. Nvidia has very strong fundamentals currently. Over the last seven years, Nvidia has reported positive revenue and net income. Both of these metrics have seen substantial growth as costs have been reduced and profit margins have improved. Since 2010 both the total assets and total capital available have nearly doubled to $7370 million and $4580 million respectively. Nvidia has also seen substantial improvements in its ROA, ROC, and ROE. As of FY2016 reporting, ROA is 10.59%, ROC is 17.04%, and ROE is 17.46%. It is estimated that in FY2017, Nvidia will see revenue of $6098 million (12.12% increase from FY2016), net income of $1381.4 million (41.8% increase), and an EPS of $2.30 (67.9% increase). Nvidia’s TTM P/E ratio is currently sitting at 38.28 compared to an industry average of 15.2 and has a P/BV ratio of 7.51 compared to an industry average of 2.7. Normally these may indicate that the stock is overvalued, however Nvidia is seemingly at the forefront of a huge growth phase in an emerging industry and it appears that the market has priced this future growth in. In the coming months we should see a reduction in the P/E ratio due to higher EPS levels. As of their latest reporting, Nvidia has a current ratio of 2.56. This shows a lot fundamental strength for Nvidia to meet and short-term liabilities. Nvidia’s FY2016 profit margin was 15.58%, and impressive number alongside an equally impressive ROE of 17.46%. Given current fundamentals, Nvidia will be able to see a growth rate of 11.1%. This number is based on an equally-weighted average between the company’s Long-Run Growth Rate (10.90%) as shown on the company’s Bloomberg Terminal page and the Sustainable Growth Rate (11.28%) derived from the following formula: (ROE*b)/[1-(ROE*b)] where ROE is the company’s return on equity for the previous fiscal year and b is the retention ratio for the company. Nvidia’s current WACC is 12.5%, which is used as a benchmark for required return. Based on these two values and Nvidia’s returns over the last six years, Nvidia has an implied value of $46,827.67 million when using an earnings power valuation model. With 535 million shares outstanding, this implies a stock price of $87.52 per share. At the closing price of $62.84 on Sept. 16, there is a margin of safety of 28%. In spite of the huge returns Nvidia has already seen this year, I believe that it still has huge upside potential and would be a fantastic long-term buy. Nvidia’s upcoming product lines and revenue streams have positioned them positioned the company to be at the forefront of a growing deep learning and AI industry. Automation and self-learning software are becoming a larger part of our lives every day and Nvidia is creating the tools necessary to meet these new computational demands.",13.100000000000003

230,2016-11-14 16:54:52,shane_stockflare,stockAday: the virtual merits of Nvidia ($NVDA),"# Key Stats for NVIDIA Corporation Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view! |Ticker|[NVDA]( |:---:|:---:| Sector | Semiconductors Latest price | $87.97 Value | $47,064M Daily vol | $1,337M Date | 14 November 2016 ### Useful Links * Latest news from [Yahoo Finance]( * Latest results from [SEC Edgar]( * Website: [nvidia.com]( # Description At their core they are *just* another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves: > NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing. And what does that mean? > a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars. In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions * GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional & Datacenters * Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business & the Automotive industry You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc. And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&D division! ## Recent financials The last 5 years started off tough with sales only getting going in the last 3 years... |Jan period end|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A| |:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| |Revenue | $5.0bn | $4.7bn | $4.1bn | $4.3bn | $4.0bn| |EPS | $1.08 | $1.12 | $0.74 | $0.90 | $0.94| But the ""breakout"" really came this year with the forecast, for year ending Jan 2017, of $6.8bn in sales and an adjusted EPS of $2.41. Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line. Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off? ## Competition Nvidia divides it's competition into > Our current competitors include: > * suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; > * suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and > * licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc. So looking at margins and returns, they are clearly in the same zone as Intel, Qualcomm and Mobileye... though are far from best in class. Perhaps that indicates there's room for further margin expansion? |Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity| |---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:| NVIDIA Corporation | $6,138M | 27% | 25% Ambarella Inc | $283M | 18% | 13% Apple Inc. | $215,639M | 33% | 37% Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. | $4,124M | -8% | -ve Intel Corporation | $57,927M | 39% | 17% Marvell Technology Group Ltd. | $2,458M | 4% | -1% Mobileye NV | $301M | 35% | 18% QUALCOMM, Inc. | $23,554M | 35% | 18% STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) | $6,781M | 13% | 1% Texas Instruments Incorporated | $13,145M | 44% | 32% ## Cash / Debt? NVIDIA has $3,626M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 8% of the market value. Far from atypical in Tech to run cash positions, so nothing to worry about here. # Wall Street thinks? The professionals on Wall Street have a $83.60 for NVIDIA Corporation and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies a downside of 5% to their target. Weird eh? A *Buy* but the target price is lower! Is this a case of Wall Street brokers being behind the curve? 3 months ago the consensus price target was $64 when the stock was at $63. *fail, Wall Street*! # Valuation The only business that's pricier is Mobileye. Surprise eh? And when I look at it's market value on $47bn versus Qualcomm on $99bn, it feels odd. Okay the growth is amazing, but what's so bad about Qualcomm (and Intel) for that matter. Even if they are ex-growth...

That is a 37% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.48 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.41. On top of dividends, the company's a fan of repurchasing stock. Just seems like they've not found any acquisition targets for their cash pile / cash machine. Either they are very disciplined, are the bees-knees at R&D and can build it all themselves... or management doesn't see a tangential business to expand into. Regardless, it's not a reason to complain. Keep the cash coming, boys! # Catalysts In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 40% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 32%. On a 1 year view the stocks up 200% v earnings forecasts up 130%. Clearly there's some ""valuation"" inflation coming thro'. On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, the CEO / founder was asked to explain what was driving the growth. It's rather a lot of techno-babble but it's worth thinking thro' > * First of all, GPU computing...we've essentially taken very compute-intensive, very graphics-intensive applications, virtualizing it and putting it into the datacenter. > * the thing that really made it possible was really the transformation of our company from a graphics processor to a general purpose processor. And then, on top of that, probably the more important part of that, is transforming from a chip company to a platform company > * And with GPU acceleration, the benefit is incredible. It's not 20%, it's not 50%, it's 20 times, 50 times. So, Nvidia is making computing faster and more power efficient. It expands dramatically what you can do (gaming, autonomous cars, etc) and where you can do it (in smaller and smaller more mobile devices). It's easy to see why this technology is important. But I feel like I missed the boat. The contrarian in me is worried by the number of requests for this stock and commentary on r/investing. # Napkin Math But to go the extra mile, let's reach for the cafe napkin, trust in Wall Street's forecasts and look out into the distant future. Sure valuations of high fliers like NVDA come back to earth, but the growth is so strong, why'd you care. |Companies|PE ratio|Growth|Divie| |---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:| NVIDIA | 37x | 25% | 1% Intel | 13x | 10% | 3% Qualcomm | 14x | 11% | 3% If NVDA going to see it's valuation return to a market rating in the long-term, then the 25% earnings from will turn into high-teens gains, as the PE compresses. In contrast, INTL and QCOM are trading below a market rating. But a re-rating aside, if they eek out low double digit growth in earnings and keep a high divie, their long-term gains is almost the same. |Companies|Gain = |Change in Valuation + |Growth + |yield| |---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:| NVIDIA | 18% = |-8% + | 25% + | 1% Intel | 16% = | 3% + | 10% + | 3% Qualcomm | 16% = | 2% + | 11% + | 3% So, I can take the hot stock and hold it for 10 years or the old men and get to the same place. Assuming Wall Street's good at forecasting. An assumption that's proved unreliable in the past. ;) Perhaps I should consider a tangential bet? e.g. [Citrix]( or [VMware]( if the virtualization story is key.

232,2016-12-23 00:08:40,SteamandDream,What to do with my NVDA stock?,"I'm new to investing and I had a good friend (and more experienced trader than I) tell me that he considers holding stock for anything less than a year to be gambling, so I bought a stock with the intention of listening to his advice. I bought NVDA at $60 in September and it closed today at $107, up 78%...When I bought it, I had planned to hold it for a year or so and then sell it. At that time though my thought process was ""I hope I'm not getting in too late because it has already grown a lot in the past year, but it's a good company in a good industry, so hopefully it'll be between $70 and $80 next year and I can save 10% of my gains by holding it for one year""...Obviously it has obliterated my expectations and now I'm conflicted as to whether or not I should stick to my original intention (hold for a year) or take the money and run. If I ran, it would be on Jan 2 (avoid counting it against 2016 taxes) or if the stock hit 100.00 or less next week...Am I doing this wrong? Should I instead set goals of gains (5% and sell, 10% and sell, etc) without care for the length of holding? Should I instead be flexible (goals for holding period and gains) and play things by ear? I read [this article]( today that says that ""short investors should stop loss at $93 and long investors should stop loss at $69"" but how short is ""short term"" and how long is ""long term"" in this article? I have no intention of holding it for 5 years. I think it's funny that had I played the ""run"" card on Nov 11th I'd have missed out on $20/share of gain...up until today I had been firmly in the ""hold for a year or so"" camp which got me that extra $20/share, but this just seems too good to be true, like why would the stock price just keep soaring? Soaring after an earnings report or huge deal announcement is one thing, but it seems to me that the company is soaring based on high expectations, which (as an amateur investor) says to me that if it only ""meets expectations"" (0.83 EPS) on it's earnings report that it's value will plummet. I feel like I might be behaving like a naive fool for clinging to this ""hold for a year"" mentality, but, then again, listening to it a month ago has resulted in me getting 33% more gains; devil on one shoulder, angel on the other, and no past experiences (or knowledge) to indicate whom is wiser. Any advice is welcome. Background that may help with advice: at this point in my life (24 and single) I have no intention of building a long-term portfolio and instead intend to play with a little of my money to get a feel for how it all works before my money matters (i.e. family and whatnot). My reason for getting into stocks was to simply make sure my saved money keeps up with inflation (as opposed to rotting away in a savings account), therefore most of my money (my ""long term"" money) is in an S&P ETF where it is accomplishing this goal.

234,2017-01-10 12:41:00,Charuru,My thoughts on competition to NVDA in GPUs,"If you're interested in investing in NVDA check out my new subreddit /r/NVDA_Stock. It's shamelessly inspired by /r/AMD_Stock You can read and discuss this article here: **Nvidia's GPU revenue is secure for the next year, there is still no competition.** There are many bears that are concerned about competition from AMD's Vega in both gaming and deep learning. I took the time to learn about Vega and study the state of the competition seriously. My conclusion is that competition is **non-existent**. **Gaming** Polaris failed to make an impact as we saw last quarter with NVIDIA's record revenues and AMD's very weak revenues. Coming a full year later after the launch of Pascal, Vega is expected to hit around GP104 performance. This level of performance is probably too low. GP104 was top tier in 2016 but will be merely mid-tier in 2017. The 1080ti will replace the 1080 as the gaming flagship for NVIDIA and Vega will only work as mid-tier competition. NVIDIA should also launch their Pascal refresh or Volta cards by fall of this year. If that's the case, then GP104 will fall to mid-low tier, not mid tier, and Vega will only compete on the budget level. As a result NVIDIA will once again face no competition in most of the market for gamers. **Deep learning** In deep learning competition is again non-existent. Many people have pointed to Google also offering AMD cards in their cloud as a sign of validation for AMD as a deep learning competitor. But this is untrue and a media scam, or worse yet, some kind of scheme to fool investors. Read the google cloud announcement directly instead of reading an ignorant regurgitation from financial news outlets. > Google Cloud will offer AMD FirePro S9300 x2 that supports powerful, GPU-based remote workstations. We'll also offer NVIDIA® Tesla® P100 and K80 GPUs for deep learning, AI and HPC applications that require powerful computation and analysis. GPUs are offered in passthrough mode to provide bare metal performance. Up to 8 GPU dies can be attached per VM instance including custom machine types. As we can see, only NVIDIA cards are being offered for deep learning. AMD cards are only used for remote workstations, an old and uninteresting usecase. AMD has no competition for deep learning as of yet. The FirePro cards are offered at extreme discounts to the NVIDIA equivalents, we're talking about prices that are only 1/2 to 1/4 as much. Yet Quadro and Tesla dominate the market vs FirePro. In any case, NVIDIA is not interested in engaging in a race to the bottom with AMD and the customer base for those products are generally not so price sensitive. AMD also announced a Vega based ""Instinct"" deep learning platform. Though 5 years late, AMD is hoping to start the catch up with the launch of Vega. There are 2 questions to think about with Instinct in respect to whether or not it'll be successful in deep learning. Question 1 is the hardware, is it competitive with P100? Question 2 is the software, can the CUDA moat of NVIDIA be breached? **THE HARDWARE** Reference article: Hardware-wise, NVIDIA has a feature advantage. NVIDIA's cards are optimized for ""deep learning operations"" while AMD is not. But let's be clear here, ""deep learning operations"" is marketing for INT8. Most deep learning today is done on FP16. P100 is ""10x"" faster than Maxwell partly based on improvements to FP16 deep learning operations and is today far ahead of any competition. In the future, AMD is advertising better support for FP16, bringing them up to parity with NVIDIA in that regard. But NVIDIA is moving ahead with support for INT8 operations, an even faster way of doing deep learning than FP16. INT8 is however useful only in some usecases. > Deep learning research has found that trained deep neural networks can be applied to inference using reduced precision arithmetic, with minimal impact on accuracy. These instructions allow rapid computation on packed low-precision vectors. Tesla P4 is capable of a peak 21.8 INT8 TOP/s (Tera-Operations per second). Investors should be careful to note that this is only NVIDIA marketing, INT8's usefulness in the real world has not yet been proven. In this case, hardware for INT8 did not exist prior to Pascal and it will be with the expansion of Pascal into the market that real applications for INT8 will be written. However if NVIDIA is correct (and I think they are), INT8 represents yet another generationally important hardware feature that NVIDIA has over AMD. But let's ignore this for now and talk about competition in the more traditional FP16. AMD is offering a Polaris, Fiji, and Vega based solution. Anandtech is politely saying that Polaris and Fiji are generally worse than the NVIDIA options. > The MI6 and MI8 will be going up against NVIDIA’s P4 and P40 accelerators. AMD’s cards don’t directly line-up against the NVIDIA cards in power consumption or expected performance, so the competitive landscape is somewhat broad, but those are the cards AMD will need to dethrone in the inference landscape. I'll be more realistic and say right away that simply means AMD is completely non competitive for the Polaris and Fiji products, especially considering the relative price inelasticity of deep learning customers and NVIDIA's lead in CUDA (which I'll get to in section 2). More interesting is MI25, the upcoming Vega based product. It's got new architectural improvements of uncertain value. We simply don't know how it will compete against P100. > As AMD’s sole training card, the MI25 will be going up against NVIDIA’s flagship accelerator, the Tesla P100. And as opposed to the inference cards, this has the potential to be a much closer fight. AMD has parity on packed instructions, with performance that on paper would exceed the P100. AMD has yet to fully unveil what Vega can do – we have no idea what “NCU” stands for or what AMD’s “high bandwidth cache and controller” are all about – but on the surface there’s the potential for the kind of knock-down fight at the top that makes for an interesting spectacle. And for AMD the stakes are huge; even if they can’t necessarily win, being able to price the MI25 even remotely close to the P100 would give them huge margins. More practically speaking, it means they could afford to significantly undercut NVIDIA in this space to capture market share while still making a tidy profit. Anandtech is full of optimism for the MI25. I look at it much more critically. Even if the MI25 is competitive on the hardware level it is probably too late. Like in the gaming market, it comes a full year after Pascal and Volta-based deep learning chips are probably going to be announced before their release. This year's GTC (GPU Technology Conference), the annual NVIDIA hosted conference should see the announcement of Volta based V100 for deep learning. Pascal was announced at last year's GTC. Based on this release cadence, AMD looks at least a year behind in technology even ignoring INT8. **The Software, CUDA Moat.** A lot of investors have heard of CUDA and how important it is in deep learning. But it doesn't seem like its importance is sufficiently stressed seeing as how many bears are still out there talking about competition. CUDA has already won, there is no war, the war is over. NVIDIA's proprietary platform is as dominant as windows is over Linux. CUDA is easier to use, have a vastly bigger community, resources, tooling, love and support from everyone. There is basically no alternative. The idea of OpenCL winning vs CUDA in 2017 is as farcical as the idea of Linux winning over Windows on the desktop in 2017. So long as people love CUDA they will stick with NVIDIA. AMD is going to attempt to breach the CUDA moat with the Boltzmann Project. It's a project to poorly port CUDA code to AMD compatible OpenCL code. To me this sounds almost a bit delusional... but I'll talk about it anyway. Has any software platform ever won by creating an emulator / port layer for another platform's user apps? Doesn't such a thing just send the signal that the winning platform has, in fact, won? The Boltzmann Project is of dubious quality technology wise. I read in many places that the output is garbage. But just humoring it, we have to raise the question why anyone would want to port from a popular and great environment like CUDA to a crappy one like OpenCL in the first place. The only answer is, they don't want NVIDIA to get a monopoly on deep learning (it's too late NVDA already has a monopoly) and want to support AMD to help it become a competitor. The only problem is such logic is that computer scientists are not fanboys. People generally don't spend weeks of work time to help out a company for the purpose of charity. They want to get stuff done, make software, get their AIs to make recommendations, help translate languages, create machine music, make medical diagnosis, whatever it is that they're doing. Is it possible for AMD to make ground in the CUDA moat? I can't dismiss it out of hand, if AMD makes an unrealistic, absurd amount of investment in that effort, I can see them making progress. [It's just extremely unlikely, and everyone knows it.]( ) In conclusion, there are no concerns about competition vis-a-vis AMD. But that doesn't mean there isn't a bear case for the NVDA stock.

240,2017-04-15 12:16:20,abaabe10,(My first) DD on $NVDA,"Please give me feedback on my DD, and the formatting. I will try to implement ""fixes"" on this post. &nbsp; General Information: *P/E Ratio 38.05 *Div Yield 0.59 *Market Cap 56.30B *Institutional Ownership 75% &nbsp; P/E Ratio: A few interesting things to consider here are: Q1 2015 P/E Ratio ~18 Q1 2017 P/E Ratio ~ 42 Also note the fact that in Q1 2015 the stock cost only $20. In my opinion NVDA is not overvalued at all. Every single segment is more than likely going to grow (more on that later). When you compare NVDA to other tech growth stocks a P/E of 38 doesn't seem so high anymore. For example: ANET 52, SKY 61, and then there are players like TSLA that don't even have income. NVDA is the top growth stock for a reason. &nbsp; Institutional Ownership: An interesting thing to keep an eye on is that on March 31, 2016 institutional ownership was at a high of 90.72%. Which shows that quite a bit of institutions jumped ship, but the shares were picked up by non-institutional owners. However, 75% is still a quite high ownership when compared to AMD, INTC and others. **I am a bit worried that the drop we are seeing right now is a result of more institutions jumping ship.** &nbsp; Now getting to the actual interesting part: My DD on Q1 2018 earnings: &nbsp; This is an important [slide]( to estimate future growth: One thing to note is that the gaming segment is historically very weak in the first quarter. &nbsp; Gaming: [Sources]( are saying that this quarters gpu sales are down 15%, which is 10% more than in the past. This sounds bad, but one has to remember that 15% down from a record $1,348M income is still a load of money. That results in an income of $1,146M, which is still in line with NVDA's estimated revenue for this quarter. On the other side of things, the 1080TI sales are estimated to be quite high. Additionally, it seems that NVDA has picked up quite a bit of market [share]( from its competitors. &nbsp; Professional Virtualization: I don't have too much to say about this segment, but I am sure that it will bring in over $200M in revenue. &nbsp; Data center: This segment seems to be exploding. NVDA's revenue trippled year over year, and it doesn't seem to slow down. If you look at the rest of the market, you will come to the same conclusion. I would be surprised if revenue was below $300M. &nbsp; Auto: Tesla recently broke out, because they finally got their production up. Additionally, their pre-orders are not stopping. This translates 1:1 into NVDA's revenue. NVDA currently has over 50 automated driving partners. I wouldn't be surprised to see a beat up to $175M, but since I like to be conservative I will say $140M. &nbsp; Lastly we have OEM & IP, which seems to be the least interesting segment. It has been declining for some time now. Maybe I am missing something here, but I don't think so. We are still going to see a solid $150M of revenue in this segment. &nbsp; Now one last thing are the switch sales. The sales were [reported]( to be 2.4 Million units in its first month. That *could* translate into more than $100M in Q1 revenue assuming Nintendo had kept their inventory at JIT levels. Edit on this: Actually NVDA's Q1 ends on May 1, which means it is quite likely that Switch will reach 3 Million by that point. We might see more than $150M in revenue from the Switch. &nbsp; **Finally, if we add up all the segment we are well above the estimated $1.9B in revenue.** I think that even if we ""only"" reach the estimated 1.9B we will go back up from the current $95 per share to at least $105. A beat might create a second Q3 2016 (maybe not that big haha).",6.666855631141348

Most recently, Nvidia has been big into Artificial intelligence. Most headlines reference something to do with AI. I think this transition from gaming to AI is important for Nvidia's growth in the next decade. My price target for them is a 40% upside, $329. Is that even possible given how much it's grown this past year? I think so. I'm just going to go over some catalysts and some risks: Catalysts * New GeForce series using the new Volta architecture, Series 20. Announcement will be big, should be in March 2018. The already released GPUs with Volta have been successful, I expect that trend to continue. * Cryptocurrency becoming more popular. Crypto isn't going away, so I'd assume it to be a catalyst. I don't like to pay attention to it. * Two years until we are seeing some of Nvidia's big autonmous vehicles come to life. Both the driving platform they are developing in china with ZF and Baidu, and the Volkswagen VW AI-infused Bus are expected to be actualized in 2020. If we see some success in the execution of these projects, I'd consider it a catalyst. I'm confident their execution will be successful given the success they've already demonstrated in AI with their datacenter revenue. * Gaming industry big news (PC). Every year there is more gamers, every year gamers get better jobs, every year there are more games. GPUs are an integral part to gaming, so these revenues will grow with the gaming market. Risks: * Semiconductor industry decline. The semiconductor industry is interesting because a decline in one can cause they others to underperform. This is an entire topic on its own. * AMD/new GPU designer taking market share from Nvidia. Unlikely, but Nvidia's dominance in the GPU market is why I am so bullish. I want to invest in the leader of AI deep learning training hardware and graphics processing, not the second best. * Jensen Huang, the CEO, losing his ability to lead the company. Nvidia has has successfully positioned themselves to be a part of the future of AI, which I think is accredited to Huang's execution. This is a positive, he's invested in the company. The downside to this is that he is very important and anything that hurts his ability to lead would hurt Nvidia. * New GeForce 20 series being not much of an upgrade from series 10, possibility but I think unlikely. Unlikely because their Titan V uses 12nm technology. Price Target: * I used a DCF model to arrive at the price target of $329, using a 7% discount rate and 1% perpetual growth rate. In the model I assume 39% revenue growth in Nvidia's 2019 fiscal year, 32% in 2020, and 28% in 2021. I based this off their plans in autonomous driving, and their new GeForce series to be released with Volta architecture. What I think: I think Nvidia successfully integrating its hardware into so many big company's is a huge success for their long term goals. Nvidia hardware is being utilized in Tesla's electic car's autopilot 2.0, and used by Google and Amazon Web Services datacenters. Nvidia is so dominant that no one can take these positions unless the company wants to build their own chips, which would be billions of dollars in R&D. Nvidia is supplying hardware for these big companies and there is no one to compete. TLDR: NVIDIA is investing into AI. Nvidia's Drive PX 2 operates Tesla's autopilot 2.0 system, Nvidia's new Tesla GPUs have grown datacenter revenue by 133% this last year, and their focus on the narrow AI to bring autonomous vehicles on the road is proving to be worth it. $329, long equity. Why am I doing this? Well I don't think I am perfect and I think I missed A LOT, so I want some critisism to get as close to perfection as I can.

I think many people have mortgaged their houses, taken loans etc or have too much of their portfolio concentrated in crypto and their purchasing power will drop- I dont know what plays I can establish for this?

260,2018-05-11 05:52:14,QuantalyticsResearch,Buy the weakness in NVDA,"Are investors selling Nvidia due to a 65% forecasted slowdown in cryptocurrency-linked revenue? Cryptocurrency related sales were reported to be just under USD$300mm which made up roughly 9% of total revenue. OEM sales increased 115% and 148% Q/Q & Y/Y respectively. OEM sales for this quarter came in at 12% of total revenue vs historical averages under 10%. It is clear this quarter was an outlier, yet revenue is expected to be USD$3.1bn, a 39% increase Y/Y for 2Q2019, even with a 65% drop in cryptocurrency related sales. This would imply that other core businesses like its Datacenter & Automotive sector may continue accelerating. Additionally, Nvidia’s gaming and professional visualization, where it receives 60% of its revenues, growth will likely pick up to meet the company’s revenue target. Perhaps it makes sense to buy the weakness off the crypto related fears?",-1.1538461538461537

268,2018-10-26 12:08:11,abeecrombie,"Understanding the SEMI cycle.MU, NVDA, AMD, TXN, $SOX","I though I would write a short post for some of the youngins here who have never experienced a real correction or know what a market cycle is. 1) The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful 2) Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad. For months there have been signs that the semi cycle is topping out. Suppliers like LAM and AMAT topped out a while ago as demand is slowing. And then you had KLAC at a conference a few weeks ago talking about order growth slowing and then TXN finally confirmed that we are in a semi slowdown. Why? Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS. They will keep spending but I would expect the market to be more prepared now. The good thing about the semi cycle nowadays is that there is a lot more demand than just PC's or smartphones. So eventually it will come back. And IMO we are probably half way through it already. Asian semi's and suppliers got the message a long time ago. Look to them for the first signs of a bottom. Happy trading &#x200B;",10.577601410934745

Coming at this pretty much purely from a cloud gaming view which will dominate gaming in the future. AMD: Also in the CPU market and are making major in roads here, and will likely grow market share in years to come. Google and Microsoft (leaders in the future of cloud gaming) are both using AMD gpu’s to fuel their platforms. CEO seems to have done a brilliant job since joining and should continue to do so. NVDA: Also in the AI/machine learning/full self driving space. Tesla make their own chips but if other car companies want to catch up, they go for the next best thing which is NVDA atm. NVDA has their own cloud gaming platform and it is the biggest atm but I think long term google and Microsoft will overtake them comfortably.

296,2020-09-02 09:05:02,street-guru,$NVDA - Goldman raises target to $585 on Ampere Gaming launch,"""The generation to generation improvement in performance, coupled with flat generation to generation pricing trends, implies an increase in performance/$ that is larger on the Ampere generation of cards than the Turing generation. Recall that based on data provided at Nvidia's various Investor Days, 98% of Nvidia's installed base was on Pascal (introduced in 2016) or older generation cards entering 2019. Based on past trends, we believe that around \~3/4 of the installed base was on Pascal or older generation cards entering 2020. We believe this is important as a) it implies that 3/4 of Nvidia's installed base is on cards that are \~4 years old, b) our view is that the typical GPU refresh cycle is around 4 years, and c) ultimately, we believe the larger performance/$ increase relative to prior generations could accelerate the installed base refresh cycle. Importantly, we also believe that the improved generation to generation value proposition (as measured by performance/$) will contribute to positive mix shift within the Gaming segment, and in turn, segment-level gross margins."" ""**AMD read-through.** We believe that the timing of Nvidia's Ampere introduction is in-line with investor expectations heading into the event and that this is unlikely to change sentiment on the relative competitiveness between Nvidia and AMD's Gaming GPU business, especially given our view that AMD is scheduled to release RDNA 2 GPUs in the 4Q20. While AMD has improved execution across its client CPU and server CPU businesses over the past several years, the company has seen less success in its Gaming GPU franchise with share flat to down since 2016. As a result, we expect competitive dynamics between the two companies' businesses to remain largely unchanged, with our estimates implying ongoing share loss for AMD in the near term.""",-8.593539077410044
297,2020-09-04 08:29:53,daynightcase,"NVDA bull case, need advice","I personally love this company despite the high multiple and stock being overvalued because of how innovating they are year after year and amazing leadership. There is still lot of growth in cloud and autonomous sector and they have no real competition in my opinion beside TESLA. Just watch their GTC keynote if you haven't. Its crazy how much they are keep innovating. Image processing is going to be central for AI, scientific research, autonomous and you have to use their data centers since no personal computer can have that much GPU power. Can someone in the field share more knowledge on how crucial GPU will be in coming years and how easy it is for competition to catch up?",17.955555555555556

Making room for them are three names heading down to the MidCap 400: H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), Coty (NYSE:COTY) and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS). ETSY is +5.4% postmarket; TER +3.1%; COTY +0.8%; KSS +0.5%. >Making a market-cap move up to the MidCap 400 are SmallCap 600 constituents Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING), Medpace Holdings (NASDAQ:MEDP) and Fox Factory Holding (NASDAQ:FOXF).

299,2020-09-14 07:06:34,street-guru,$NVDA - street's initial take on $40b ARM acquisition from Softbank,"This confirms months of speculation...here are the initial thoughts from analysts. **Needham** \- ""Will It Be Game Changing? We Shall See."" ""We believe the acquisition represents a big risk but with potential huge awards. From a financial perspective, this acquisition is the largest deal in NVIDIA's history. We are not concerned about the size of the deal because NVIDIA generated $4.3BN of free cash flow in FY20 and is on track to generate $5.2BN in FY21, and hence we expect it to make up the $12BN in cash fairly quickly, even without a contribution from Arm. Additionally, the dilution represents only 7% of total shares - not a major event, in our view."" ""Strategically, we believe there are several advantages: in the near-term, Arm IP is ubiquitous in the mobile phone and tablet markets with 95% share. NVDA can harvest that steady cash flow stream to finance growth. ARM has a cumulative number of licenses signed of 1,767 as of F4Q19 and 22.8 billion royalty units as reported by licensee. Longer-term, Arm is gaining inroads in the all the major secular growth drivers in technology including cloud and infrastructure equipment, edge IoT, robotics and self-driving vehicles. Arm technology is being used in advanced MCUs for IoT devices such as communication chips and sensors and broad range of networking equipment."" ""On the skeptical side of the equation, we wonder about the anti-trust factors as Arm is the ""Arms-dealer"" in the semiconductor industry with a long list of customers, which include competitors, such as TI, MRVL, AMD, IFX, QCOM, AAPL, Samsung, NXPI, AVGO and others. We also need to have a better understanding of the long-term revenue ramp and overall TAM. Arm's net sales have been lackluster for the past two fiscal years, growing 3% in FY19 and declining in FY18 due to deterioration in overall business conditions in the semiconductor industry."" **Jefferies** \- ""NVDA + ARM = $50 EPS Power in 2025"" "" We view the deal as transformative, positioning NVDA not just to capture 80% of the ecosystem value in the data center, but also unify the compute ecosystem between the edge and data center. We think the merged company has a 5-yr EPS power of $50, and increase our price target to $680, and bull-case to $1,000."" ""We estimate the deal to be slightly accretive the first year after close."" ""Transformative Deal - Heterogeneous Data Center Scale Solution Provider: In previous computing eras, one ecosystem typically controlled 80% of the profits of the ecosystem – in PCs it was Wintel, in Smartphones it is Apple. Due to the ecosystem it has created in Acceleration (processor, interconnect (MLNX), software stack including CUDA and vertical market software), we’ve argued that Nvidia was best positioned to capture 80% of the profits of the Parallel Processing Era. However, with ARM, we think Nvidia is poised to also offer general purpose, heterogeneous data center scale solutions and ultimately capture up to 80% of the value of the serial processing part of the data center ecosystem as well. We also think that ARM gives it a larger moat in the data center."" ""Transformative Deal - Unifying the Edge with the Data Center: the Cell Phone / Server Computing Era was the first where compute bifurcated, and two separate ecosystems operated in parallel (Apple’s ecosystem in the Smartphone, and Wintel in the data center). Should Nvidia successfully acquire ARM, then the compute ecosystem will be unified from edge to data center, and we would expect Nvidia to offer more highly integrated compute solutions across the entire compute ecosystem, and realize the lion’s share of the profits in this 4th Tectonic Shift in Computing."" ""Five-year EPS Power of $50. We believe this is a differentiated interpretation of NVidia's earnings potential which stems from our view that Nvidia is supplying an ecosystem in the data center, much like Apple supplies to the smart phone market, or Intel and Microsoft did in PCs. In contrast to other traditional semiconductor competitors, Nvidia's ecosystem extends beyond processors, to high speed interconnect (MLNX) and a software stack. During the PC Era, Microsoft's PC operating profit was similar to Intel's, and we think Nvidia's earnings potential framework should be modeled more like Wintel, with half of its earnings power coming from the ecosystem that it created. We model Nvidia Data Center processor revenues of $34bn in 2025, and Data Center Ecosystem (software) of an additional $34bn."" **RBC -** ""We continue to believe the same three major points: 1) biggest hurdle in our view is approval/official closing of transaction; 2) if the transaction closes, we think this would be a notable negative for Intel and a notable positive for Nvidia; and 3) with Apple, Amazon, and now Nvidia, a robust software ecosystem is ready to support an ARM-based server environment over the long term."" "" What do Apple and Nvidia have in common? Access to successful software ecosystems. Since x86 has been the dominant player in the server market, Nvidia could argue that the transaction would create more competition against the x86 market. Currently, the market is largely Intel \~85–90% (x86) and AMD 8–10% (x86) and a few points “Other” depending on how one defines the total market. If Nvidia puts research and development dollars behind the transaction, an ecosystem to compete against x86 would be possible, in our view, given Nvidia’s success with CUDA. Finally, AWS has a new Graviton product based on ARM architecture. It is arguably a stable/solid alternative given its lower power consumption. We’ve seen this story twice in the past in the Flops/Watt (GPU>CPU) and TCO (AMD>INTC"" **Raymond James** \- "" As we had suspected earlier, much of the justification for the deal in the presentation centers on the datacenter market. Based on our initial read of the presentation, we view this as an assault on Intel’s server CPU business. The intention would seem to be to become able to offer server customers a broader roadmap that covers both CPU, GPU and server. It’s yet unclear however about how a NVDA datacenter business that would offer server CPUs benefit from NVDA owning ARM as opposed to simply being a licensee. Nonetheless, we do view this as a move on NVDA’s part to compete more fully with both INTC and AMD in the server pace. MRVL is also an ARM licensee for server CPUs, but since MRVL has already announced that they would only pursue custom server CPU engagements going forward, we don’t expect much impact to MRVL. Undoubtedly, the combination of ARM’s leading processor IP with NVDA’s GPU and AI IP will create a powerful combination. But it’s not immediately clear how NVDA intends to leverage having ARM under their own ownership, and will expect that vision to be part of the company’s presentation. ""The presentation notes that NVDA intends to continue ARM’s open licensing model and NVDA IP would also be added to ARM’s licensing business. That could certainly become additive to the revenue for the total licensing business, but more details will need to be provided to understand the potential revenue synergies."" ""The transaction requires regulatory approval the U.K., China, the European Union and the United States. China approval will naturally be viewed as a risk given US/China trade tensions. Since ARM IP is the foundation of nearly all handsets and IOT devices, we would expect the deal to be highly scrutinized, and we would expect that NVDA would need to provide assurances that it will continue an open licensing model. NVDA is an ARM licensee, but ARM processors is a small part of NVDA’s business, limited to the automotive business (3% of revenue) and the Nintendo Switch custom processor (4% of revenue, by our estimates). Therefore, since there is a very small part of revenue in which NVDA competes with ARM licensees, we don’t expect that to raise significant regulatory concerns.""",7.0762597012597

307,2021-01-14 13:33:12,Okmanl,Anyone here buy and hold the most hyped stocks on Reddit from 3-5 years ago? How has that turned out?,"So far I'm going with Jeff Bezos' investing philosophy he outlined in one of his interviews. To just pick a bunch of high risk, high reward long term opportunities, and invest in all of them. If any one or multiple of them pan out, then it'll easily make up for the losers. So far I've decided to just completely ignored index funds. Instead I'm just DCAing into whatever I find has huge long term potential based off of what reddit, youtube, motley fool or ARK has hyped up. 80% of my portfolio is in BTC, ETH, TSLA, SQ, LMND, DKNG, uranium stocks, and ARK ETFs. I'm planning on adding solar and marijuana ETFs. I've also decided not to sell a single stock no matter what happens, until I have enough to just put everything on VT/VTI and live off of that. Has anyone else pursued this strategy for the past 4-5 years? If so how did it pan out? When I look at old posts from 2-3 years ago it seems that AMD, MSFT and NVDA were the ones that were hyped up.

308,2021-01-19 04:19:07,alles_long,AMD: Undervalued at $90,"AMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th. As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $90. I’ve made a previous [post]( about this but there was some news last week which I incorporated in here is well. &#x200B; **Intel struggles** Last week Intel has announced that they will replace Bob Swan with Pat Gelsinger as their CEO. This has led to Intel stock going up 13% and AMD dropping 5-6%. Intel is trading above(!) above the stock price they were when they announced the delays in 7nm/5nm. I think this reaction is severely overdone. Note that Pat used to be CTO at Intel for many years and is not the fresh blood they need to turn this colossal company around. Also in the time he was CEO of VMware (since 2012) the stock only rose 60% which is not a great performance comparing it to competitors. Intel has already announced their Q4 ER will beat estimates but that was a given. The only thing that is relevant is their outlook, which is still going to be meager since a CEO impact the company over years time (see AMD themselves) . AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could see something similar if Intel gives a weak guidance for the coming year(s) &#x200B; **AMD Q4 and FY** EPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage. &#x200B; **2021&2022 Outlook** But the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC’s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU’s that can go head to head with NVDA’s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger goes trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned tailwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply P/E’s off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML’s for example (50). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target. &#x200B; **Booming Market** Finally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion. &#x200B; Position: 2750 shares, 5000 LT warrants, 200 29Jan’21 100Calls.",5.84469696969697

The stock has moved sideways for a while since the ARM acquisition is on standby pending antitrust reviews in several countries and the outlook is rather negative on the subject because of complications with ARM China. This vaguely reminds me of Tesla initially being denied inclusion in the S&P 500, the stock went flat and down for a few months and the market was ""surprised"" when S&P eventually included them, which they could have done at any time. Also I think they are poised to capture a good chunk of self driving with a system similar to Tesla based on vision (no lidar) and machine learning (not geofenced), which doesn't seem priced in.

311,2021-02-22 08:57:58,norcalnatv,NVDA ER and ARK Invest point to more upside for NVIDIA,"Nvidia reports earnings for FY21 Wednesday the 24th. Analysts are expecting revenue of $4.8B and EPS of $2.80. My expectation is closer to $5.1-$5.2B and EPS and $3+ for the Quarter. Nvidia has topped revenue estimates 10 of the last 12 quarters and beat profit estimates in 11 of the last 12. Demand remains high and the company has indicated their gaming segment is already sold out through Q1. The blog below has an interesting take on the overlap of these two companies. It describes how NVIDIA’s technology covers every single point in ARK Invest’s 2021 “Big Ideas” presentation. I really doubt there is another “disruptively innovating” company making such an impact against their ""big ideas."" Certainly ARK’s #1 holding TSLA, isn’t anywhere near significant to their future as NVDA, let alone the others rounding out their top 5: Square, Teledoc, Roku or Baidu. The mysterious part is NVDA is one of ARK’s smaller holdings. All NVDA shares in the three ARK funds they’re held in make up only 0.5% of all assets in ARK’s actively managed funds. Counter intuitive. ARK has started buying NVDA more prominently in late Dec. With positive earnings and a big fund acquiring looks like there could be plenty of upside in NVDA. [",10.326347894529713
312,2021-03-24 00:48:19,SnooObjections2665,Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolution,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include: * Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security * Cloud Computing * Ai * Advanced Robotics / automation * Big-data * 3D printing * Quantum computing (hypothetically) * Robotic process automation (RPA) * Semi-conductors * Biotechnology / Healthcare * IoT manufacturing * Renewable energy * Manufacturing / Mining * Crypto (I have no experience in this besides some small positions in BTC and ETH, feel free to drop any DD and knowledge) Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few. since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase. **Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?** **Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap. &#x200B; * **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security** * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD** * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security. * **Cloudflare - $NET** * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare * **BlackBerry - $BB** * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector. * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention. * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data. * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity. * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality. &#x200B; * **Cloud Computing** * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But Amazon and Microsoft are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent. * **Amazon - $AMZN** * **Microsoft - $MSFT** * **Cloudflare - $NET - See DD in previous category** * **Fastly - $FSLY - Need DD** * **Digital Ocean - $DOCN - Need DD** &#x200B; * **Ai** * **Google - $GOOGL - Need DD** * **C3Ai - $AI - Need DD** * **Nvidia - NVDA - Need DD** * **Intel - INTC - Need DD** &#x200B; * **Advanced Robotics / automation** * **Teradyne - $TER** * Focusses on industrial automation, semiconductor testing, wireless testing and storage testing. Customers are Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. **Some of their business units are:** * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics. * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries. * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries. * **Cyberdyne - $CYBQY - Need DD** * **ABB - $ABB - Need DD** &#x200B; * **Big-data** * **Palantir - $PLTR** * This is the way * **SalesForce - $CRM** * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior. * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences. * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD** &#x200B; * **3D Printing** * **Desktop Metal - $DM** * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials. * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website** * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry. * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD** &#x200B; * **Quantum Computing** * **IonQ - $DMYI** * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([ thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([ * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value. IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([ &#x200B; * **Robotic process automation** * **Blue Prism - $PRSM - Need DD** * **UiPath - $UIPTH (IPO later this year)** &#x200B; * **Semi-Conductors:** * **ASML Holding - $ASML** \- ASML makes the machines to produce semi-conductors.

It's currently the largest supplier of photolithography systems for the semiconductor industry. * **Intel - $INTC - Need DD** * **Advanced Micro Devices - $AMD - Need DD** * **Nvidia - $NVDA - Need DD** * **Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg - $TSM - Need DD** &#x200B; * **Biotech / Healthcare** * **Crispr Therapeutics - $CRSP - Need DD** * **Beam Therapeutics - $BEAM - Need DD** &#x200B; * **Internet of Things manufacturing** * **PTC - $PTC - Need DD** &#x200B; * **Renewable Energy** &#x200B; * **Construction / Mining** * **MP Materials (NYSE: MP) - DD from** u/FlynnPierce * is a rare earth mining and processing company who owns and operates THE ONLY rare earth mine source in the US. This resource provides the essential metallic and magnetic raw materials used in most modern technology from Electric Vehicles to windmills and robotic arms. Yeah. That’s HUGE. There is obviously a massive need for these resources going forward and MP is the only chance the US has of competing with China in this demand. Of course, China operates in a market condition where they can exploit working conditions and the workforce in ways that American companies cannot, and MP claims to engage in their mining activity sustainably. Noting that MP (Mountian Pass) Mine is in California, we can assume they are doing their best to remain in compliance with a green energy future.

They had actual decent revolutionary products too: From Java programming language to SPARC processors, StarOffice, MySQL, Solaris OS, VirtualBox & ZFS! They were involved in all important areas of tech. This is what the CEO wrote to bagholders: “At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64?

The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. I also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning. I do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows.

335,2023-05-24 19:13:21,cookingboy,Nvidia shares spike 26% on huge forecast beat driven by A.I. chip demand,"Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings for its fiscal 2024 on Wednesday, with a stronger-than-expected forecast that drove shares up 26% in extended trading. Here's how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates for the quarter ended in April: EPS: $1.09, adjusted, versus 92 cents expected Revenue: $7.19 billion, versus $6.52 billion expected Nvidia said it expected sales of about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the current quarter, more than 50% higher than Wall Street estimates of $7.15 billion. Prior to the after-hours move, Nvidia stock was up 109% so far in 2023, mostly driven by optimism stemming from the company's leading position in the market for artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was seeing ""surging demand"" for its data center products. Nvidia's data center group reported $4.28 billion in sales, versus expectations of $3.9 billion, a 14% annual increase. Nvidia said that performance was driven by demand for its GPU chips from cloud vendors as well as large consumer internet companies, which use Nvidia chips to train and deploy generative AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Nvidia's strong performance in data center shows that AI chips are becoming increasingly important for cloud providers and other companies that run large numbers of servers. However, Nvidia's gaming division, which includes the company's graphics cards for PC sales, reported a 38% drop in revenue to $2.24 billion in sales versus expectations of $1.98 billion. Nvidia blamed the decline on a slower macroeconomic environment as well as the ramp up of the company's latest GPUs for gaming. Nvidia's automotive division, including chips and software to develop self-driving cars, grew 114% year over year, but remains small at under $300 million in sales for the quarter. Net income for the quarter was $2.04 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $1.62 billion, or 64 cents, during the year-earlier period. Nvidia's overall sales fell 13% from $8.29 billion a year ago. *Personal take*: I don’t even know what to say, this is simply astonishing. The AFH price puts NVDA at 20% above its previous ATH. This jump would have been insane even for 2021, let alone the tech market of 2023.

Passive investors dream of cashing out on that compounded 9.1%/year growth of the S&P 500 over time, and we can all backtest and see that past performance. But we can't really backtest the ever-increasing observer effect that index investing must have over time.

It is neither *predictive* in what will happen next nor is it *prescriptive* in suggesting any course of investment actions. I've only done [3 predictive posts]( on this sub and this won't be one of them. For those who are too young to remember that time: There was this new thing called ""the Internet"", and it was going to forever change the world (it eventually did), and every company that hypes up some sort of ""internet tech"" (could be simple landing page that sells stuff, i.e Pets.com) received sky high valuation. And there was one company behind it that made it all possible: Cisco, the company that sells industrial routers and switches to telecom providers that power the backbone of the entire internet infrastructure, was *obviously* a company that was ""selling shovels during a gold rush"" and would take over the whole world. Its share price went up 236% from Jan.1999 to March 2000, reached a valuation of $500B+ (record high for a company back then), P/E went through the roof but it didn't matter because the *Internet Revolution^TM* was *just beginning* (and it was), so naturally Cisco's share price could only go higher. The cherry on the top was that back then the **top two** companies were *Microsoft* and *Cisco*, one would provide the software (**Internet Explorer baby!**) and the other would sell the hardware. Together they would rule the world! Now if you replace ""Internet"" with ""AI"", and ""Cisco"" with ""Nvidia"", keep Microsoft as it is (but replace ""IE"" with ChatGPT""), and we have quite a mirror version of what's happening today. Then we all know what happened. Cisco obviously survived the bubble burst and remains profitable and is still doing fine today, but $CSCO *never* recovered back to its dotcom bubble peak after crashing 80% during the dotcom bust, 23 years later. Now will the same thing happen with $NVDA? Like I said I don't know and I'm not making any predictions. All I can say is that I see a lot of parallels *so far*. **Edit**: For people replying to me arguing how you can't mine Bitcoins using network switches or how Cisco didn't do AI, *no kidding*, at no point did I claim the two companies are identical and sell the same things, that would be idiotic.

Currently, I own 50 shares of NVDA valued at around $30,000, purchased back in 2017 at $34 per share, with a cost basis of $1,700. This stock has seen unbelievable growth since then of over 1600% and now constitutes 45% of my non-taxable investment account and roughly 20% of all my investment accounts, excluding my home. Last year, I sold about $5000 worth of NVDA to diversify, but I'm torn about what to do next. On one hand, the stock has been on a tear, and their future looks extremely promising with AI advancements and the huge demand for chips going forward. However, I'm aware of the need to diversify, as well as the risk of the stock taking a massive downturn and significantly hurting my net worth. There are also tax considerations if I sell, since I'll be on the hook for some significant capital gains tax. For some context, I'm a married man with two kids, a house with $200k in equity and a $200k mortgage. I have around $80k in IRA accounts and $65k in taxable brokerage accounts amd some cash on hand for emergency fund etc. Little debt otherwise. Any advice on whether to sell and diversify, ways to mitigate risks, or hedging strategies would be greatly appreciated. How should I navigate this situation, considering the potential tax bill, its outsized share of my portfolio and the promising future for NVDA?

And until we're ready to buy we also want our money to be making money for us over while we wait. Our first thoughts were to keep our future down payment savings in one or two HYSAs earning about 4.5% APY since they're at a 15-year high. However, I know once the fed funds rate starts coming down, probably in the second half of this year, so will the rates for HYSAs. Another option we've considered is putting our down payment savings into CDs which will lock in a better rate (\~5.4%) for a year even if the fed funds rate goes down. I've also considered putting some of our savings into a brokerage account and using it to invest in the S&P 500 (likely FXAIX) and letting it grow over the next 2+ years. This could have greater returns. But of course we then run the risk of losing some of that money if the market drops. Any thoughts and opinions are welcome.",9.358187134502925

On September 28, 2018, AAPL hit an all time high of $56.44. It was followed by a steep fall to high $30s in late 2018. Almost a 30% decline. I’m sure it hurt investors at the time. And I’m sure a lot of people were kicking themselves saying “I shouldn’t have bought at all time highs when it’s so overvalued.” However, if they held for about 5 years until today they’re probably thrilled to have bought for $56.44. I’d personally load the boat with AAPL these days. Sure their return isn’t as high as it could have been but timing the market is all but impossible. My point is, if you’re bullish on a company for strong reasons. The risk of overvaluation/draw down should not keep you sitting on the side lines. Time in the market beats timing the market.

359,2024-02-13 20:04:36,anonoman010101,I think the owner of the company I work for is stuck in a ponzi scheme. How to proceed?,"Anonymous one time post. I handle the financials for a guy and his multiple companies. The owner of the company I work for has an investment broker, he's been around for a handful of few years. Almost every month (more in recent months than previously) the broker tells him he can get him a 30% return, the minimum he can buy in for every month is a million - which he takes in towards the end of every month. The owner has invested many millions and gets an interest check at the beginning of every month. I talk with both the owner and the broker fairly regularly. I was told that an extra million invested increases the monthly interest by about $23k - so annually that's about 28%. The broker has made comments such as, ""I have up to $10M available for this investment this month"". I don't know what it's actually invested in - although he does get a statement, I just haven't looked close enough at what it's invested in (although if it truly is a ponzi scheme, the statement very well could be fake). The owner has mentioned this to many other professionals he works with and many of them have reached out to me about how it's very fishy. I met the investment broker once, as did one of these other professionals, and we both had the same reaction - the broker is very arrogant, super questionable, and just comes off as a complete scum bag. The broker is listed on the website for a major investment bank. He's listed on Advisor Check and Broker Check and has what looks like a clean record - over a dozen years experience with multiple firms, multiple exams passed, licensed in 30+ states. Am I thinking wrong here? I just can't believe the return, it's completely unrealistic. It's also odd that the minimum is $1m and the guy is trying to sell more investments at the end of every month, then paying out interest at the beginning of every month - seems a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul. I've thought about making an anonymous tip to the SEC, but I feel like I'm risking a lot by doing so. I don't even know how to approach this. In my mind there's no chance this is legit, but at the same time, the interest checks have been coming in without issue.

It’s supposed to be “aggressive” at this stage and since the S&P 500 is up 25% in the last year, that’s what I expected to see when I just looked. Nope, 11% growth. Turns out this fund is in the bottom 22% percentile of its morning star category. I don’t understand why TDF’s are being so risk averse when the date is 26 years away. I know US stocks have not ALWAYS outperformed international stocks but aren’t we paying a fee for them to keep their finger on the pulse and adjust accordingly? They couldn’t maybe read the room and see we’re in a major bull market and maybe put a little more into US stocks? I’m going all in on S&P 500 and *maybe* in 10 years all start to diversify to make it more conservative. I know TDF’s are popular here but I just don’t understand how it could underperform so badly. This one year (13% in lost gains) probably set my retirement back 3-4 years. Edit: just so you all don’t think I’m ONLY looking at the last 1 year: My TDF annual return over the last 10 years is 8.5% S&P is 12% So that’s a difference of 3.5% annually over 10 years which realllly adds up. Basically my retirement portfolio would be 40% higher than it is now. 2nd Edit: since this TDF’s inception in 2007, its annual return has been 6%. S&P 500 over this time is 9%. So 1.5x the returns. This time period obviously includes the 2008 recession and S&P 500 is still waaay better.",8.382352941176473

So excuse me if it becomes a duplicate. But I figured this would be of interest to people because Nvidia has been the poster child for whether or not this is an AI bubble. I think everyone was taking wait-and-see on their earnings. And the naysayers would be able to point to missed expectations as a sign that this is a bubble. From MarketWatch : > Revenue came in at $22.1 billion, up from $6.05 billion a year before, while analysts had been modeling $20.4 billion. > Data-center revenue at Nvidia NVDA rocketed more than 400% from a year before to hit $18.4 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for $17.06 billion. > Nvidia forecasts continued strong growth for the ongoing quarter, well above expectations. The company is calling for $24.0 billion in revenue, up from $7.2 billion a year prior, while analysts were modeling $22.2 billion. > Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,” Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a release. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.” > Nvidia posted fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $12.3 billion, or $4.93 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $5.16 a share, while analysts were projecting $4.59 a share. I own Nvidia, so I admit, I am biased. But I think anyway you slice those numbers, they’re pretty damn impressive. If it’s a bubble, it’s a bubble that people are buying into. And by people, I mean, giant, multinational companies. It’s amazing growth for a company so large. I’m hoping this brings some calm back to the markets. We’ve been pivoting between irrational exuberance and panic. **EDIT**: it is the next day, and the results are in. My personal account earned 27.9% TODAY. That is from 2 NVDA options and 1 SMCI option. My larger retirement account made 11.2% today based on NVDA stock SMCI stock NVDA option and lots of ETFs. Probably no one will see this edit. But as a normal investor, the reason I’m in this space is because of these returns. The reason a lot of people are here are because of these returns.

I lived through .com era and it was vastly different. If you said you were an online mall, you could get $1 billion the next day. Because people understood malls and this Internet thing was going to raise all roofs. Pets.com? I know what a pet is..com makes it even better! I remember the exact street I was driving on when the one trillionth radio advertisement for Amazon came on the radio. And I was like, what a stupid name for a bookstore. Amazon has nothing to do with books. And for years and years and years, Amazon, lost money. They only existed because that.com Bubble had lifted them so far they had Cash. Lotsa cash. But they were a joke for about a decade. But the real big thing was almost none of those companies had a profit. They didn’t make any money whatsoever. None. No business. They were burning through cash with expensive offices, expensive staff, oh man, salaries for tech workers were astronomical. The companies that did have a profit, we’re making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didn’t meet this criteria. Cisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150. If it’s a bubble, it’s nowhere near the size of the.com bubble. S&P 500 is P/E of 22. In 2000 it was 28. From MarketWatch. > Among the record-setting elements of Nvidia’s NVDA stunning fiscal fourth quarter was its 76% GAAP gross margin, which was up from 66% a year before. Nvidia forecasts that margin will remain around the same level for its ongoing quarter. > Nvidia’s gross margins appear to be the second highest in the semiconductor industry, behind only those of Arm Holdings PLC ARM which licenses chip designs but doesn’t sell its own chips directly. Arm’s gross margins were roughly 93% in the December quarter. > Nvidia’s margins stand out among those elsewhere in the chip sector. Intel Corp. INTC, reported a gross profit margin of 46% while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, reported a 40% margin in the fourth quarter > Nvidia did note that its margins for the latest quarter and the current one could represent a peak due to favorable component costs in the supply chain in the past few months. But Nvidia had “visibility” into a mid-70% gross margin for the balance of this fiscal year, which would take margins back to where they were before this latest high-water mark. > In other words, even if Nvidia’s margins come down a bit from here, they’re still poised to sit above those from virtually every peer in the sector.",3.4727711901624945

383,2024-04-14 09:52:25,SwellsInMoisture,"10 years ago, we discussed how we select stocks. Here's the 2024 version.","Hi /r/investing, roughly 10 years ago there was a great discussion about [how we select our stocks]( I discussed my method - Trending Value - and that led to me sharing my results with many of you via a program I had written. Well, that program broke and remained dormant for years... until now. So what is Trending Value? It's a method published by James O'Shaughnessey in his ""What Works on Wall Street"" book. During decades of backtesting, it generated over 21% annual returns with equal standard deviation to the total market. It generated a lot of discussion and lead to [this follow-up thread]( In my mind, this method resonates the truest... far truer than those who advocate watching the check-out lines at your grocery store to see which products are being purchased. The method, summarizing is the following: When you run a screen for stocks with good P/E or P/B, what do you look for? You find a stock with a P/E multiple of 12. Is this good? Is this bad? Neither and both, without a frame of reference. O'Shaughnessey's method rates 6 key financial metrics for every stock against the whole market to come up with a cumulative VALUE BASED score. Those metrics are: P/E, P/B, P/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, and Shareholder Yield, which is dividend yield + stock buyback yield (i.e. equity returned to the shareholder in some way). All 6 metrics are ranked 0-100, where 100 is the ""best"" ratio in the stock universe, and 0 is the worst. The top 10% of stocks will typically have scores in the 420+ range. They are undervalued relative to the rest of the market. However, just because a stock is undervalued DOES NOT mean that it's a good buy. It could be facing legal action, failing drug trials, having a CEO that just went to jail, or other event that can't be reflected in these numbers. That's where momentum comes into play. We take the top decile of stocks and reorder them by 6-month price momentum. Invest equally in the top 25, hold for a year, liquidate, repeat. The companies you buy are undervalued and the market is rallying behind them. Back testing, while not a prediction of future results, yielded a 21.2% average ROI with this method. Of course, there's no screener that does this, nor is there a way to even view ""Shareholder Yield"" in one location. When I started this 10 years back, [I used MatLab to solve this problem]( Yes, MatLab. Wrong tool for the job. Thankfully, ChatGPT has turned even amateur hobbyist coders into useful contributors, and a python version has been born. I'll post the results of today's run below. Feel free to ask for a specific stock and I'll post the results of that ticker. Keep in mind, it is filtered to Market Cap > $200M and the name of the method is Trending VALUE - your growth stocks (NVDA, TSLA, etc) are going to be viewed very poorly. Edit: You'll occasionally see a value like ""10000"" for P/E or another field. That means the value was either missing or negative. This is to artificially just kill that field for that ticker.",5.101325757575759

387,2024-05-10 20:41:38,fireduckieman41,"If you had $500k-1M, what would you do to turn it into multi-millions? Medium to high risk answers only","Of course, there is no get rich quick scheme or else everyone would do it. But there is calculated high risks that could be taken to try and get multiples on your money in a relatively short amount of time (1-5 years). With $500k-$1M you could make pretty risky investments with potential huge returns. Assume your only goal is to become rich - as in you are not happy transitioning into a safer investment approach until you are at $5-10M (10x). Also assume you have a good job that is flexible enough to allow you to focus on your new endeavor and you have comfortable housing and basic needs covered where you don’t have to worry about ending up behind Wendy’s if you lost it all. It would suck losing all the investment money, but you are taking the risk in hopes to turn it in to life changing money. A few investment thoughts I had: - angel investment in start ups. You’d have to pick a winner which is hard of course, but definitely a way to 2-10x your initial investment if you get lucky. - invest in large real estate development. These aren’t usually just accessible to anyone, but if you happen to come across a development deal where it’s buying raw land to develop into a suburban neighborhood or building multi family/commercial, this would also be a way to 2x-10x your money depending on the deal. These funds work similarly to angel investments. There is either some syndication group that makes a fund to raise capital to buy land to develop into something and your investment gets you equity in the deal and this group would have a clear exit plan for how to return investors money. I think these deals are safer than angel investing, but harder to come across. - full time focus on trading. Stock market, crypto, whatever. With the stock market in particular you could have a (I know options is very high risk) a safer lower risk, longer expiration option trading strategy on large blue chip companies with very expensive contracts trading at a level that the average person just simply can’t trade on. For example, a $900 NVDA 3/25 call trading for a whopping $18k per contract. - buy a small online or physical business with the plan of investing significant capital in expanding the business heavily through marketing and acquiring assets to make it grow Little background on me: My wife and I bought a house every year since we were married. We had 3 by the time the Covid boom happened, all of them doubled in value. Sold one, bought 2 more that needed work and rehabbed them heavily and turned them into airbnbs - still early covid boom. We are relatively young (31 and 30), but lately we have been thinking, if it’s worth selling some property and trying alternative riskier investment strategies. Realistically, our homes are not doubling again in the next 5 years. We already received the “life changing” money benefit from making relatively smart real estate investments. The initial plan wasn’t to make a killing this quickly, but since we did maybe we should take some off the table and try our hand at something else. I get it, houses are a good long term buy and hold, especially since we have them at low interest rates. Yes, I also know we could do cash outs, but interest rates are higher now. We are young and could take ourselves to the next level with the proper risk and we are willing to consider it. Anyways, what kind of riskier investments would y’all look into? EDIT and TLDR: if you had $500k-$1M what medium to high risk investment would you do? EDIT: I do not have that money, but I could if I sold some of my houses and I am curious what others would do if they had that money in cash.

391,2024-06-05 13:01:30,StatQuants,Nvidia briefly passes Apple as second most valuable public U.S. company,"[ [Nvidia]( briefly passed [Apple]( in market cap on Wednesday during intraday trading as the chipmaker emerges as the primary beneficiary of the [artificial intelligence]( boom. If it holds until the close, it will be the second most valuable U.S. company. Nvidia hit a [$3 trillion market cap]( milestone during intraday trading. Nvidia had a market value of $3.007 trillion at one point, versus Apple’s, which stood at $3.005 trillion. Nvidia shares have risen over 24% since the company [reported first-quarter earnings]( in May and have been on a tear since last year. The company has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, on which big tech companies spend billions. Investors are also becoming more comfortable that Nvidia’s huge growth in sales to a handful of cloud companies can persist. For the most recent quarter, its data center business, which includes its GPU sales, rose 427% in a year to $22.6 billion in sales, about 86% of the company’s overall revenue. Meanwhile, Apple shares are only about 5% this year, as Apple’s sales growth has stalled in recent months. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Apple said overall sales dropped 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% from the year-ago period. Apple faces strategic questions and issues about demand in China, manufacturing, and mixed reactions to its new virtual reality headset, Vision Pro. Apple was the first company to reach $1 trillion and $2 trillion market caps. It has frequently been the most valuable U.S. company over the past few years but was again [passed by Microsoft]( earlier this year. Microsoft has benefitted from the same investor demand for AI as Nvidia. Nvidia’s stock has been more volatile than Apple. Founded in 1991, it was primarily a gaming company, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently it has sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services. Nvidia shares have gone parabolic as its AI business has developed, rising over 3,290% in the past five years. It announced a [10-1 stock split in May](",14.823232323232322

Why must it come down? Well, I'm a firm believer that narratives drive market sentiment, way more than fundamentals or valuations. Narratives, especially when repeated, permeate. And for the past 5 days, the narrative builders have been relentless in giving a negative short term assessment of NVDA stock. By narrative builders, I mean the financial industry people on TV asked to comment. I will give you an example. On Friday, Jim Cramer alluded to NVDA being overbought and how Larry Williams' model was predicting a pull back of the stock until end of July. This morning, Fairlead's Katie Stockton was also on Squawk Box, saying that even though she firmly believes in the bull market, NASDAQ 100 will see some pain as soon as people see that NVDA is a bit overstretched. Just 30 minutes ago, Jeff Kilburg of KKM Financial called that it's time to trim, take profits given that the stock added 1 trillion dollars in valuation. There are countless others from different sources. I really believe that once you start to hear so many ""experts"" and street people talk like this, it is reasonable to expect that a stock will come down. Not because they are right in their assessment but because others listen to it and start to wonder about trimming their positions in a self-fulfilling prophecy. This happens even if only in the very short term, before correcting to the upside and pushing higher to new highs. I actually think we are seeing the very pullback already: today, on a day when the Nasdaq is rising by 1.2%, Nvidia has found resistance around 0.3% increase and seems to be headed lower. Recently, NVDA has been the one pushing Nasdaq to new highs, so just this inversion is noteworthy. I am not a bear. At least not in that sense. And I do hope NVDA pulls back 10-20% because I intend to buy more. Cheers.",6.620698325243779

Let’s look into some figures for comparison: regarding NVDA, the current market capitalization as of June 2024 is around $3T. This valuation makes NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world by market cap, even higher than the peak valuation of over $1 trillion for TSLA. In October 2021, TSLA PE ratio was quite high, reflecting its growth expectations and market enthusiasm. The PE ratio was around 250.96 at the end of September 20211, and it likely remained in a similar range throughout October. The forward PE ratio, which is based on projected earnings, was also elevated, indicative of the optimism about the company's future performance. As for NVIDIA, as of today, the current PE ratio is approximately 77.182. The forward PE ratio, which considers expected future earnings, is around 46.823 (TSLA at its peak:67.57).

A little back story, I bought my first shares in Feb 2017 for $2.77 and again in October for $4.86. I’ve continued to buy big chunks of it over the last 7 years because I thought GPUs would be needed for self driving cars.

Gains are around 2600% which is insane. I still have more conviction that Ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so I’m a bit torn on actually selling any of it. If I sold all the other years people told me Nvidia had mooned, well I wouldn’t be sitting on the gains I have today. My gut is telling me to only sell 1/3 of my holding but I have no idea where else to rotate this into.

Some ideas I have: Investing in upcoming stock splits - Chipotle, Broadcom, Sony. I feel like this could be a good short-ish term play to try and capitalize on the splits. Open to thoughts on this. Other thoughts would be watching AMD as the stocks been hammered due to the alleged data breach, so keeping an eye on this and catching it during the dip could be good. I’m very interested in companies competing with Nvidia right now, such as AMD and intel which both have chips that claim to compete with Nvidias. I’m interested to see what other high risk options you would suggest, as I’ve been loosely following the market and may be missing out on things to keep an eye on.

I would pay 20% federal + 12.3% CA state tax on this position if I sell it to diversify into an say SPY. I get that it's prudent to diversify, but at any cost? It's an immediately 1/3 haircut to diversify! Let's assume my mega cap drops by 50%, since the mega techs are a bell weather, I would expect that we'd see SPY drop by 20-25% as well. Then they both probably recover. So if I diversify, I'd take a 1/3 haircut and then a 20-25% haircut in a worst case scenario vs. 50% haircut in my non-diversified position. Same end result. Am I missing something? Best case, the mega-cap tech stock continues to do better or same as SPY.

I have roughly the same worth amount of nvda shares plus a few other stocks and index funds. The nvda shares alone can pay off the mortgage balance If you were me, would you pay off your 7.89mortgages using proceeds from nvda shares? If not selling nvda, would you pay it off with cash. i also have about same amount of cash at sideline. I do have 12 month emergency funds in t bills, so not in a big urgent need for that cash 06 29 Edit: Thanks every one who replied. This post gave me great insights. Based on every remarkable reply in this post, here is the adjusted decision.. ( i was proning to completely pay off using sideline cash). Here is the adjusted decision I will pay 1/2 to 2/3 outstanding mortgage balance with cash on hands. I will leave the rest 1/2 to 1/3 to reset to the higher 7.885% rate. Reason being: 1) Last 30 year s&p average return is 10% ish a year. I have a good opportunity for the 2% opportunity gain in next a few years which I belive we are still in a cyclical bull market and has more than 50% chance to gain double digit next years. 2) the 7.885% reset would stay 12month only. i believe FED will cut rate soon, so the 7.885% would reset to a 7% apr in 2025 September and even further down in 2026. Then the opportunity gain for Not payinb off will be greater in 2025. 3) My NVDA shares would have tax implications and it’s really not worth selling at this level. 4) I need a small mortgage to prevent real estate fraud. A mortgaged house usually won’t get scammed since banks have crazy checks on documents.. I won’t pay off that loan until 2050… lol",11.03046594982079

I’ve updated with figures and portfolio. Hello all, My dad, 3 years ago, gave a financial advisor who he hired through his bank about $300k of capital to invest with. Since then the total yield has been about 6% on that money, about a 2% annual yield. Which my dad’s friends have told him is ridiculously low. I asked to take a look at my dad’s portfolio and a lot of the company’s are no names and the portfolio is many pages long, I can add pictures of the portfolio in the comments if that’s any help. This is not to mention that the 401k he has given said financial advisor about $800,000 in over the course of 10 years, which has him at about a total of 1.2 million right now. I would imagine is also a very low yield. His friend has told him that the total PROFIT he should have made off of that amount should have been 1.8/1.9 mil. He has absolutely 0 knowledge on anything investing, but has decided to have a talk with his financial advisor on what he’s paying him for exactly. What should he tell his financial advisor?

417,2024-08-30 20:12:11,dukerustfield,Nvidia’s massive stock buyback,"From MarketWatch. > The semiconductor company announced alongside its earnings on Wednesday that it has boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion. That’s double the size of the $25 billion share-repurchase program announced a year ago > Looking beyond the year, Nvidia’s announcement is tied for the 12th-largest [stock buyback] on record. The company is one of only seven in the U.S. to have announced a buyback program of $50 billion or more. The buyback authorization is 1.7% the size of Nvidia’s market capitalization, which is about $2.91 trillion. I tend to like stock buybacks. I like them more than dividends. The company has enough faith in itself that it wants to secure more of its own profits. If you’re spiraling down in the dumpster, there’s really no need to buy back— especially if you believe this is the High Point and it’s only going down from here. Nvidia has a number of problems. One is that it has a gigantic amount of cash. It was estimated that within three years it might be able to turn out 270 billion in free cash flow But as the big player in the market, both its own specific market and the broader market, it’s gonna have a real tough time making big deals. Meaning deals significant enough to affect the bottom line. It’s in the old-school Microsoft phase where everything it does is gonna be examined for antitrust. Can you imagine if they tried to buy AMD or something like that? It’s never gonna happen even if it made sense and didn’t destroy competition. So they’ve got infinite money and kind of very finite things to do with it. their purchases of other companies has been around 300 *million* this year. Which is entirely insignificant. However, I worry that the stock is insanely expensive. It’s noted that this gives them the option to pull the trigger whenever they want. So if there is a downturn, that’s good news for them because they’ll be able to spend triple digit billions buying themselves back. So in one sense, you can look at this as potentially bad news. Meaning they expect enough volatility, including down swings, to make it possible and profitable to have the 12th largest buyback in history. OR they feel they aren’t gonna drop and this is just a low point of a forever-climbing stock price. Either way it’s good for Nvidia, but it makes it tough for investors to predict. If this was anyone else, I think it would be a little bit easier, but there’s so much money and the scale is so vast that it’s hard to wrap my head around. If they had been able to buy the dip a month or so ago, it’s astounding how much money they would’ve made. Not to mention securing more of their future profits. Obviously, companies of this size don’t move that fast and they aren’t playing a shell game. So it’s merely just a thought experiment to see how much money they would’ve created out of a blip. Lots of companies do buybacks, and lots of high-tech companies do buybacks. And the timing of it can generally illuminate a lot of things. But in this instance, I’m having a tough time seeing through it. In the past, they haven’t been a really savvy financial company. They’re not doing all kinds of tricks and schemes and mergers and things to burn short sellers and whatever. They’ve just been “boring” R&D and managed to get ahead of at least three or four massive shifts in technology in the world economy. The stock split. I had kind of considered it surprising. It just didn’t fit who they’ve been up to this point. Why does it matter if they’re 3000 or 100? I suppose it’s nice that more of the unwashed can get in on the purchase. But it seems to be a small distinction. Like how many people could afford a few hundred bucks but not a few thousand bucks? AND are buy and hold stock investors. I said at the time it wasn’t gonna move the needle whatsoever. But beyond that, I just don’t really see the point. As I’ve said, there’s a lot of reasons to do a stock buyback. But this magnitude and at this price have left me guessing. I like to think it’s optimism of their future. And that two years from now the stock is going to be much higher. In which case it made perfect sense to buy now. That’s my hope anyways. Edit: sorry for typos my phone won’t let me scroll back for some reason",9.624120956399434

Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may *revise* their ratings or ***price targets*** for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a **spike** in NVDA’s stock price.

I've been investing here and there but the main source of this success was two tech monsters: $NVDA and $AMD. (My very first trade with $AMD was when it was $2.86 per share and $NVDA with $33.) Come to think of it, I would have made way more money if I've put 100% of my portfolio into these two but I can't be complaining with what I've already made as a beginner.

435,2018-07-12 21:44:59,ResistantOlive,NVDA (and possibly AMD) is screwed for Q2 Earnings,"First off, we all love NVDA and it's an amazing meme stock. A lot of us have made countless amounts of money off of these guys. But for Q2 earnings they're fucked. 1: Take a look at these [GPU price graphs]( The trend is a huge peak and slow fall, but all of this happened before Q1 earnings, meaning their large beat in may was heavily influenced by this. Since the beginning of february GPU prices are 30% lower. Due to the law of supply and demand, this means that the supply was too high and the demand fell - meaning NVDA lost money on a lot of these cards. A price drop at this scale means a large excess of inventory - i'll get to that later. 2: Cryptocurrency fad is dead for the time being. The following is a quote from their CFO about cryptocurrency (which NVDA does not like to talk about): > “Cryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected, but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto-specific GPUs, which are included in our OEM business at $289 million,” Kress said. “Looking into Q2, we expect crypto-specific revenue to be about one-third of its Q1 level.” Since Nvidia's total revenue was [$3.207 billion]( in the first quarter, this means a 7% drop in revenue Q/Q due to only cryptocurrency. 3: [Gigabyte, a company which makes NVDA cards saw their revenue fall 30% in june.]( This is the most direct evidence revenues are going to massively fall, as this was right when graphics cards saw a huge price drop. 4: [Allegedly there was an OEM who returned 300,000 GPUs back to Nvidia.]( If this is true that is around $150 million in revenue lost assuming an average price of $400 per card (really rough estimate). That's another 7% meaning these two things combined could show a 14% loss in revenue Q/Q. This shows another instance of inventory mismanagement on NVDA's part. All in all NVDA could see a large drop in earnings. Due to the nature of this stock, however, there's no telling if it actually goes down after earnings. If AMD earnings come out bad that will prove some of these points and give you a warning as to what NVDA earnings hold, so I suggest watching AMD if you will play NVDA. - TL;DR: NVDA made too many cards cause of crypto or something else, GPU prices are down, and their earnings are fucked.",2.796419342930972

MU, NVDA, TXN, AMAT, SOX","I though I would write a short post for some of the youngins here who have never experienced a real correction or know what a market cycle is. 1. The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful 2. Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad. For months there have been signs that the semi cycle is topping out. Suppliers like LAM and AMAT topped out a while ago as demand is slowing. And then you had KLAC at a conference a few weeks ago talking about order growth slowing and then TXN finally confirmed that we are in a semi slowdown. Why? Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS. They will keep spending but I would expect the market to be more prepared now. The good thing about the semi cycle nowadays is that there is a lot more demand than just PC's or smartphones. So eventually it will come back. And IMO we are probably half way through it already. Asian semi's and suppliers got the message a long time ago. Look to them for the first signs of a bottom. Happy trading",10.577601410934745

442,2020-05-17 13:52:55,HyperInflation2020,NVidia – Know What You Own,"How many people really understand what they’re buying, especially when it comes to highly specialized hardware companies? Most NVidia investors seem to be relying on a vague idea of how the company should thrive “in the future”, as their GPUs are ostensibly used for Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, holograms, etc. Having been shocked by how this company is represented in the media, I decided to lay out how this business works, doing my part to fight for reality. With what’s been going on in markets, I don’t like my chances but here goes: Let’s start with… **How does NVDA make money?** NVDA is in the business of semiconductor design. As a simplified image in your head, you can imagine this as designing very detailed and elaborate posters. Their engineers create circuit patterns for printing onto semiconductor wafers. NVDA then pays a semiconductor foundry (the printer – generally TSMC) to create chips with those patterns on them. Simply put, NVDA’s profits represent the difference between the price at which they can sell those chips, less the cost of printing, and less the cost of paying their engineers to design them. Notably, after the foundry prints the chips, NVDA also has to pay (I say pay, but really it is more like “sell at a discount to”) their “add-in board” (AIB) partners to stick the chips onto printed circuit boards (what you might imagine as green things with a bunch of capacitors on them). That leads to the final form in which buyers experience the GPU. **What is a GPU?** NVDA designs chips called GPUs (Graphical Processing Units). Initially, GPUs were used for the rapid processing and creation of images, but their use cases have expanded over time. You may be familiar with the CPU (Central Processing Unit). CPUs sit at the core of a computer system, doing most of the calculation, taking orders from the operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux), etc. AMD and Intel make CPUs. GPUs assist the CPU with certain tasks. You can think of the CPU as having a few giant very powerful engines. The GPU has a lot of small much less powerful engines. Sometimes you have to do a lot of really simple tasks that don’t require powerful engines to complete. Here, the act of engaging the powerful engines is a waste of time, as you end up spending most of your time revving them up and revving them down. In that scenario, it helps the CPU to hand that task over to the GPU in order to “accelerate” the completion of the task. The GPU only revs up a small engine for each task, and is able to rev up all the small engines simultaneously to knock out a large number of these simple tasks at the same time. Remember the GPU has lots of engines. The GPU also has an edge in interfacing a lot with memory but let’s not get too technical. **Who uses NVDA’s GPUs?** There are two main broad end markets for NVDA’s GPUs – Gaming and Professional. Let’s dig into each one: **The Gaming Market:** A Bit of Ancient History (**Skip if impatient**) GPUs were first heavily used for gaming in arcades. They then made their way to consoles, and finally PCs. NVDA started out in the PC phase of GPU gaming usage. They weren’t the first company in the space, but they made several good moves that ultimately led to a very strong market position. Firstly, they focused on selling into OEMs – guys like the equivalent of today’s DELL/HP/Lenovo – , which allowed a small company to get access to a big market without having to create a lot of relationships. Secondly, they focused on the design aspect of the GPU, and relied on their Asian supply chain to print the chip, to package the chip and to install in on a printed circuit board – the Asian supply chain ended up being the best in semis. But the insight that really let NVDA dominate was noticing that some GPU manufacturers were focusing on keeping hardware-accelerated Transform and Lighting as a Professional GPU feature. As a start-up, with no professional GPU business to disrupt, NVidia decided their best ticket into the big leagues was blowing up the market by including this professional grade feature into their gaming product. It worked – and this was a real masterstroke – the visual and performance improvements were extraordinary. 3DFX, the initial leader in PC gaming GPUs, was vanquished, and importantly it happened when funding markets shut down with the tech bubble bursting and after 3DFX made some large ill-advised acquisitions. Consequently 3DFX, went from hero to zero, and NVDA bought them for a pittance out of bankruptcy, acquiring the best IP portfolio in the industry. **Some more Modern History** This is what NVDA’s pure gaming card revenue looks like over time – NVDA only really broke these out in 2005 (note by pure, this means ex-Tegra revenues): 📷 [ So what is the history here? Well, back in the late 90s when GPUs were first invented, they were **required** to play any 3D game. As discussed in the early history above, NVDA landed a hit product to start with early and got a strong burst of growth: revenues of 160M in 1998 went to 1900M in 2002. But then NVDA ran into strong competition from ATI (later purchased and currently owned by AMD). While NVDA’s sales struggled to stay flat from 2002 to 2004, ATI’s doubled from 1Bn to 2Bn. NVDA’s next major win came in 2006, with the 8000 series. ATI was late with a competing product, and NVDA’s sales skyrocketed – as can be seen in the graph above. With ATI being acquired by AMD they were unfocused for some time, and NVDA was able to keep their lead for an extended period. Sales slowed in 2008/2009 but that was due to the GFC – people don’t buy expensive GPU hardware in recessions. And then we got to 2010 and the tide changed. Growth in desktop PCs ended. Here is a chart from Statista: 📷[ This resulted in two negative secular trends for Nvidia. Firstly, with the decline in popularity of desktop PCs, growth in gaming GPUs faded as well (below is a chart from Jon Peddie). Note that NVDA sells discrete GPUs, aka DT (Desktop) Discrete. Integrated GPUs are mainly made by Intel (these sit on the motherboard or with the CPU). 📷 [ You can see from the chart above that discrete desktop GPU sales are fading faster than integrated GPU sales. This is the other secular trend hurting NVDA’s gaming business. Integrated GPUs are getting better and better, taking over a wider range of tasks that were previously the domain of the discrete GPU. Surprisingly, the most popular eSports game of recent times – Fortnite – only requires Intel HD 4000 graphics – an Integrated GPU from 2012! So at this point you might go back to NVDA’s gaming sales, and ask the question: What happened in 2015? How is NVDA overcoming these secular trends? The answer consists of a few parts.Firstly, AMD dropped the ball in 2015. As you can see in this chart, sourced from 3DCenter, AMD market share was halved in 2015, due to a particularly poor product line-up: 📷 [ Following this, NVDA came out with Pascal in 2016 – a very powerful offering in the mid to high end part of the GPU market. At the same time, AMD was focusing on rebuilding and had no compelling mid or high end offerings. AMD mainly focused on maintaining scale in the very low end. Following that came 2017 and 2018: AMD’s offering was still very poor at the time, but cryptomining drove demand for GPUs to new levels, and AMD’s GPUs were more compelling from a price-performance standpoint for crypto mining initially, perversely leading to AMD gaining share. NVDA quickly remedied that by improving their drivers to better mine crypto, regaining their relative positioning, and profiting in a big way from the crypto boom. Supply that was calibrated to meet gaming demand collided with cryptomining demand and Average Selling Prices of GPUs shot through the roof. Cryptominers bought top of the line GPUs aggressively. A good way to see changes in crypto demand for GPUs is the mining profitability of Ethereum: 📷 [ This leads us to where we are today. 2019 saw gaming revenues drop for NVDA. Where are they likely to head? The secular trends of falling desktop sales along with falling discrete GPU sales have reasserted themselves, as per the Jon Peddie research above. Cryptomining profitability has collapsed. AMD has come out with a new architecture, NAVI, and the 5700XT – the first Iteration, competes effectively with NVDA in the mid-high end space on a price/performance basis. This is the first real competition from AMD since 2014. NVDA can see all these trends, and they tried to respond. Firstly, with volumes clearly declining, and likely with a glut of second-hand GPUs that can make their way to gamers over time from the crypto space, NVDA decided to pursue a price over volume strategy. They released their most expensive set of GPUs by far in the latest Turing series. They added a new feature, Ray Tracing, by leveraging the Tensor Cores they had created for Professional uses, hoping to use that as justification for higher prices (more on this in the section on Professional GPUs). Unfortunately for NVDA, gamers have responded quite poorly to Ray Tracing – it caused performance issues, had poor support, poor adoption, and the visual improvements in most cases are not particularly noticeable or relevant. The last recession led to gaming revenues falling 30%, despite NVDA being in a very strong position at the time vis-à-vis AMD – this time around their position is quickly slipping and it appears that the recession is going to be bigger. Additionally, the shift away from discrete GPUs in gaming continues. To make matters worse for NVDA, AMD won the slots in both the New Xbox and the New PlayStation, coming out later this year. The performance of just the AMD GPU in those consoles looks to be competitive with NVidia products that currently retail for more than the entire console is likely to cost. Consider that usually you have to pair that NVidia GPU with a bunch of other expensive hardware. The pricing and margin impact of this console cycle on NVDA is likely to be very substantially negative. It would be prudent to assume a greater than 30% fall in gaming revenues from the very elevated 2019 levels, with likely secular decline to follow. **The Professional Market:** A Bit of Ancient History (again, skip if impatient) As it turns out, graphical accelerators were first used in the Professional market, long before they were employed for Gaming purposes. The big leader in the space was a company called Silicon Graphics, who sold workstations with custom silicon optimised for graphical processing. Their sales were only $25Mn in 1985, but by 1997 they were doing 3.6Bn in revenue – truly exponential growth. Unfortunately for them, from that point on, discrete GPUs took over, and their highly engineered, customised workstations looked exorbitantly expensive in comparison. Sales sank to 500mn by 2006 and, with no profits in sight, they ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2009. Competition is harsh in the semiconductor industry. Initially, the Professional market centred on visualisation and design, but it has changed over time. There were a lot of players and lot of nuance, but I am going to focus on more recent times, as they are more relevant to NVidia. **Some More Modern History** NVDA’s Professional business started after its gaming business, but we don’t have revenue disclosures that show exactly when it became relevant. This is what we do have – going back to 2005: 📷 [ In the beginning, Professional revenues were focused on the 3D visualisation end of the spectrum, with initial sales going into workstations that were edging out the customised builds made by Silicon Graphics. Fairly quickly, however, GPUs added more and more functionality and started to turn into general parallel data processors rather than being solely optimised towards graphical processing. As this change took place, people in scientific computing noticed, and started using GPUs to accelerate scientific workloads that involve very parallel computation, such as matrix manipulation. This started at the workstation level, but by 2007 NVDA decided to make a new line-up of Tesla series cards specifically suited to scientific computing. The professional segment now have several points of focus: 1. GPUs used in workstations for things such as CAD graphical processing (Quadro Line) 2. GPUs used in workstations for computational workloads such as running engineering simulations (Quadro Line) 3. GPUs used in workstations for machine learning applications (Quadro line.. but can use gaming cards as well for this) 4. GPUs used by enterprise customers for high performance computing (such as modelling oil wells) (Tesla Line) 5. GPUs used by enterprise customers for machine learning projects (Tesla Line) 6. GPUs used by hyperscalers (mostly for machine learning projects) (Tesla Line) In more recent times, given the expansion of the Tesla line, NVDA has broken up reporting into Professional Visualisation (Quadro Line) and Datacenter (Tesla Line). Here are the revenue splits since that reporting started: 📷 [ 📷 [ It is worth stopping here and thinking about the huge increase in sales delivered by the Tesla line. The reason for this huge boom is the sudden increase in interest in numerical techniques for machine learning. Let’s go on a brief detour here to understand what machine learning is, because a lot of people want to hype it but not many want to tell you what it actually is. I have the misfortune of being very familiar with the industry, which prevented me from buying into the hype. Oops – sometimes it really sucks being educated. **What is Machine Learning?** At a very high level, machine learning is all about trying to get some sort of insight out of data. Most of the core techniques used in machine learning were developed a long time ago, in the 1950s and 1960s. The most common machine learning technique, which most people have heard of and may be vaguely familiar with, is called regression analysis. Regression analysis involves fitting a line through a bunch of datapoints. The most common type of regression analysis is called “Ordinary Least Squares” OLS regression, and that type of regression has a “closed form” solution, which means that there is a very simple calculation you can do to fit an OLS regression line to data. As it happens, fitting a line through points is not only easy to do, it also tends to be the main machine learning technique that people want to use, because it is very intuitive. You can make good sense of what the data is telling you and can understand the machine learning model you are using. Obviously, regression analysis doesn’t require a GPU! However, there is another consideration in machine learning: if you want to use a regression model, you still need a human to select the data that you want to fit the line through. Also, sometimes the relationship doesn’t look like a line, but rather it might look like a curve. In this case, you need a human to “transform” the data before you fit a line through it in order to make the relationship linear. So people had another idea here: what if instead of getting a person to select the right data to analyse, and the right model to apply, you could just get a computer to do that? Of course the problem with that is that computers are really stupid. They have no preconceived notion of what data to use or what relationship would make sense, so what they do is TRY EVERYTHING! And everything involves trying a hell of a lot of stuff. And trying a hell of a lot of stuff, most of which is useless garbage, involves a huge amount of computation. People tried this for a while through to the 1980s, decided it was useless, and dropped it… until recently. What changed? Well we have more data now, and we have a lot more computing power, so we figured lets have another go at it. As it happens, the premier technique for trying a hell of a lot of stuff (99.999% of which is garbage you throw away) is called “Deep Learning”. Deep learning is SUPER computationally intensive, and that computation happens to involve a lot of matrix multiplication. And guess what just happens to have been doing a lot of matrix multiplication? GPUs! Here is a chart that, for obvious reasons, lines up extremely well with the boom in Tesla GPU sales: 📷 [ Now we need to realise a few things here. Deep Learning is not some magic silver bullet. There are specific applications where it has proven very useful – primarily areas that have a very large number of very weak relationships between bits of data that sum up into strong relationships. An example of ones of those is Google Translate. On the other hand, in most analytical tasks, it is most useful to have an intuitive understanding of the data and to fit a simple and sensible model to it that is explainable. Deep learning models are not explainable in an intuitive manner. This is not only because they are complicated, but also because their scattershot technique of trying everything leaves a huge amount of garbage inside the model that cancels itself out when calculating the answer, but it is hard to see how it cancels itself out when stepping through it. Given the quantum of hype on Deep learning and the space in general, many companies are using “Deep Learning”, “Machine Learning” and “AI” as marketing. Not many companies are actually generating significant amounts of tangible value from Deep Learning. **Back to the Competitive Picture** **For the Tesla Segment** So NVDA happened to be in the right place at the right time to benefit from the Deep Learning hype. They happened to have a product ready to go and were able to charge a pretty penny for their product. But what happens as we proceed from here? Firstly, it looks like the hype from Deep Learning has crested, which is not great from a future demand perspective. Not only that, but we really went from people having no GPUs, to people having GPUs. The next phase is people upgrading their old GPUs. It is much harder to sell an upgrade than to make the first sale. Not only that, but GPUs are not the ideal manifestation of silicon for Deep Learning. NVDA themselves effectively admitted that with their latest iteration in the Datacentre, called Ampere. High Performance Computing, which was the initial use case for Tesla GPUs, was historically all about double precision floating point calculations (FP64). High precision calculations are required for simulations in aerospace/oil & gas/automotive. NVDA basically sacrificed HPC and shifted further towards Deep Learning with Ampere, announced last Thursday. The FP64 performance of the A100 (the latest Ampere chip) increased a fairly pedestrian 24% from the V100, increasing from 7.8 to 9.7 TF. Not a surprise that NVDA lost El Capitan to AMD, given this shift away from a focus on HPC. Instead, NVDA jacked up their Tensor Cores (i.e. not the GPU cores) and focused very heavily on FP16 computation (a lot less precise than FP64). As it turns out, FP16 is precise enough for Deep Learning, and NVDA recognises that. The future industry standard is likely to be BFloat 16 – the format pioneered by Google, who lead in Deep Learning. Ampere now does 312 TF of BF16, which compares to the 420 TF of Google’s TPU V3 – Google’s Machine Learning specific processor. Not quite up to the 2018 board from Google, but getting better – if they cut out all of the Cuda cores and GPU functionality maybe they could get up to Google’s spec. And indeed this is the problem for NVDA: when you make a GPU it has a large number of different use cases, and you provide a single product that meets all of these different use cases. That is a very hard thing to do, and explains why it has been difficult for competitors to muscle into the GPU space. On the other hand, when you are making a device that does one thing, such as deep learning, it is a much simpler thing to do. Google managed to do it with no GPU experience and is still ahead of NVDA. It is likely that Intel will be able to enter this space successfully, as they have widely signalled with the Xe. There is of course the other large negative driver for Deep Learning, and that is the recession we are now in. Demand for GPU instances on Amazon has collapsed across the board, as evidenced by the fall in pricing. The below graph shows one example: this data is for renting out a single Tesla V100 GPU on AWS, which isthe typical thing to do in an early exploratory phase for a Deep Learning model: 📷 [ With Deep Learning not delivering near-term tangible results, it is the first thing being cut. On their most recent conference call, IBM noted weakness in their cognitive division (AI), and noted weaker sales of their power servers, which is the line that houses Enterprise GPU servers at IBM. Facebook cancelled their AI residencies for this year, and Google pushed theirs out. Even if NVDA can put in a good quarter due to their new product rollout (Ampere), the future is rapidly becoming a very stormy place. **For the Quadro segment** The Quadro segment has been a cash cow for a long time, generating dependable sales and solid margins. AMD just decided to rock the boat a bit. Sensing NVDA’s focus on Deep Learning, AMD seems to be focusing on HPC – the Radeon VII announced recently with a price point of $1899 takes aim at NVDAs most expensive Quadro, the GV100, priced at $8999. It does 6.5 TFLOPS of FP64 Double precision, whereas the GV100 does 7.4 – talk about shaking up a quiet segment. **Pulling things together** Let’s go back to what NVidia fundamentally does – paying their engineers to design chips, getting TSMC to print those chips, and getting board partners in Taiwan to turn them into the final product. We have seen how a confluence of several pieces of extremely good fortune lined up to increase NVidia’s sales and profits tremendously: first on the Gaming side, weak competition from AMD until 2014, coupled with a great product in form of Pascal in 2016, followed by a huge crypto driven boom in 2017 and 2018, and on the Professional side, a sudden and unexpected increase in interest in Deep Learning driving Tesla demand from 2017-2019 sky high. It is worth noting what these transient factors have done to margins. When unexpected good things happen to a chip company, sales go up a lot, but there are no costs associated with those sales. Strong demand means that you can sell each chip for a higher price, but no additional design work is required, and you still pay the printer, TSMC, the same amount of money. Consequently NVDA’s margins have gone up substantially: well above their 11.9% long term average to hit a peak of 33.2%, and more recently 26.5%: 📷 [ The question is, what would be a sensible margin going forward? Obviously 33% operating margin would attract a wall of competition and get competed away, which is why they can only be temporary. However, NVidia has shifted to having a greater proportion of its sales coming from non-OEM, and has a greater proportion of its sales coming from Professional rather than gaming. As such, maybe one can be generous and say NVDA can earn an 18% average operating margin over the next cycle. We can sense check these margins, using Intel. Intel has a long term average EBIT margin of about 25%. Intel happens to actually print the chips as well, so they collect a bigger fraction of the final product that they sell. NVDA, since it only does the design aspect, can’t earn a higher EBIT margin than Intel on average over the long term. Tesla sales have likely gone too far and will moderate from here – perhaps down to a still more than respectable $2bn per year. Gaming resumes the long-term slide in discrete GPUs, which will likely be replaced by integrated GPUs to a greater and greater extent over time. But let’s be generous and say it maintains $3.5 Bn Per year for the add in board, and let’s assume we keep getting $750mn odd of Nintendo Switch revenues(despite that product being past peak of cycle, with Nintendo themselves forecasting a sales decline). Let’s assume AMD struggles to make progress in Quadro, despite undercutting NVDA on price by 75%, with continued revenues at $1200. Add on the other 1.2Bn of Automotive, OEM and IP (I am not even counting the fact that car sales have collapsed and Automotive is likely to be down big), and we would end up with revenues of $8.65 Bn, at an average operating margin of 20% through the cycle that would have $1.75Bn of operating earnings power, and if I say that the recent Mellanox acquisition manages to earn enough to pay for all the interest on NVDAs debt, and I assume a tax rate of 15% we would have around $1.5Bn in Net income. This company currently has a market capitalisation of $209 Bn. It blows my mind that it trades on 139x what I consider to be fairly generous earnings – earnings that NVidia never even got close to seeing before the confluence of good luck hit them. But what really stuns me is the fact that investors are actually willing to extrapolate this chain of unlikely and positive events into the future. Shockingly, Intel has a market cap of 245Bn, only 40Bn more than NVDA, but Intel’s sales and profits are 7x higher. And while Intel is facing competition from AMD, it is much more likely to hold onto those sales and profits than NVDA is. These are absolutely stunning valuation disparities. If I didn’t see NVDA’s price, and I started from first principles and tried to calculate a prudent price for the company I would have estimated a$1.5Bn normalised profit, maybe on a 20x multiple giving them the benefit of the doubt despite heading into a huge recession, and considering the fact that there is not much debt and the company is very well run. That would give you a market cap of $30Bn, and a share price of $49. And it is currently $339. Wow. Obviously I’m short here!",10.669130880527193
443,2020-06-30 14:42:56,Blencera,"1,5 Years Since My Journey Began, $52 591 dollars wealthier & only 18 months left.","*Introduction* I'm 20 years old and my interest for the stock market began at age 16 which later grew into becoming my lovely addiction and before graduating high school i already had a detailed plan on how i would become financial independent and self employed as quick as possible, the first milestone to reach before continuing my dreams are to reach an entire net worth of $100 000 dollars. In the beginning of setting the $100 000 dollar goal i started with $13 953 dollars and today 1,5 years later i have a total net worth of $66 544 dollars which basically means i only have 33,45% left of the goal to complete within 18 months which is entirely possible. It felt so much harder in the beginning but hard work pays off. While creating the plan i expected to have $52 730 dollars this month of the year but from making better decisions, working hard and presumably a little touch of luck i'm 5 months ahead. I maximized the overtime-limit at my workplace last year which is roughly 200 hours per year, i managed to reach 212h, sadly the overtime is cancelled due to covid-19 but currently i have 24h 36m in overtime. I've driven taxi *(illegally which i stopped doing)*, been cutting lawns an lending out money in order to speed up the process of my journey. I've cut almost all unnecessary expenses, i don't travel, i rarely drink alcohol, still driving around in my $1 000 dollar car watching others laugh at me but don't get me wrong, i enjoy traveling and eventfully i'm going to buy myself a new car, i don't want to create wealth just to stare at it. This is something i been planning for a very long time and that i'm fully committed to. It's psychologically frustrating but in the end it's definitely going to be worth it. *Portfolio distribution* * *Stocks: 35,79% ($23 816)* * *Funds: 8,27% ($5 503)* * *Ready assets:* 55,93% ($37 218) * *Stocks:* ATVI, AAPL, **AZN**, BAC, **CAST**, DAL, MSFT, **HUFV A**, **KIND SDB**, NFLX, NVDA, **SWED A**, UBER * *Funds:* **Avanza Auto 6, Avanza USA, Spiltan Aktiefond Investmentbolag** note: *The Tickers with bold fonts are swedish stocks/funds which may not be available in your country.* I sold a majority of my shares in the beginning of 2020 expecting a recession or correction but instead we got covid-19 which was extremely unpredictable so i was really lucky that i already had a pretty high amount in liquidity. So far i've been taking advantage of the pandemic by investing in stocks that i hopefully believe will recover. I also did some Q1 report trading which made me about $3 000 dollars profit, i traded CAST, GOOG, TWTR and I'm constantly looking for opportunities. I'm expected to be fully invested within 1 year and i'm not stressed by having 55,93% liquidity since the inflation is 0. The *""fear of missing out""* is also nothing that's bothering me, everything can happen, especially now. *Income, expenses & conditions* My monthly income varies depending on how much i work but i averaged $3 008 dollars after taxes during 2019, i invest everything except $500 dollars and the reason how i can invest 83,37% of my monthly income is because i still live at home. The only reason why i still live at home is so i can take advantage of the opportunity to invest and build myself a foundation. *The Missing piece* What i'm missing is friends and connections with this interest in common, i rarely have anyone to talk with when it comes to investments and such so i really hope that i can reach out to some of you. If you're interested just send me a message, thanks for reading and if you have any questions i'll be happy to answer.",5.776888604353394
444,2020-08-27 18:58:08,fire_water76,"How I applied Buffet's strategies to my own portfolio, +70% networth, beat SP500 by 40%","I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k]( 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -> Aug. I beat the [SP500 by 40%]( in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180->300]( I did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. I did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. #High level advice: ========================================= I picked the 7 I agree with. 1. Invest in what you know…and nothing more. 2. Never compromise on business quality 3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever 4. Diversification can be dangerous 5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing) 8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold) 10. Only listen to those you know and trust I firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing. #General mindset: ================ - Keep emotions out of the market - Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO. - Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. - Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. - Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake) - Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. #Application: ================================================================== I was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. As a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. Based on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good ""feel"" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). I tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned. My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. Post COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason. My hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. 1. eCommerce + AdTech 2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra) 3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions) These are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock: 1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision? 2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies? 3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? 4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate? 5. Who are their customers and target demographic? 6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case. In March, I took what I believe to be an ""educated gamble"". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased. *EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. I have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5. Here are the non FAANGs I chose. 1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. 2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle. 3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. 4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon. 5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. 6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext. 7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. ""Zoom parties"" and ""Zoom dates"" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives. 8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. 10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps. 11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. 12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. 13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say ""Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?"" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs. 14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs. Mutual funds/ETFs 1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. 2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. 3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... Titanvest: I was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio. #Some things I do that that are against the grain: - Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations. - I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares. - I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. One example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. Lastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. Also, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",12.437145051180137
445,2020-09-29 08:46:06,ixamnis,Investing in ETFs,"A couple of weeks ago, I posted a comment in response to a question about ETFs. This question comes up very often; usually two or three times a week. Maybe more than that. Several people suggested that it be ""pinned."" I obviously cannot do that, however if a mod wants to pin this, feel free to do so. I did make a few modifications and additions to that comment and for those who haven't gone back to see the changes, I thought I'd post it again here. Hopefully, this helps people who are interested in an investing approach that is either made up of ETFs or that includes ETFs as a part of their portfolio. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **QQQ** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced). **VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VGT**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist. **IWF** \- This is a Russell 1000 Growth fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. Other funds that use the Russell 1000 Growth Index include **RWGV** and **VONG**. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**. **VONE** and **IWB** use the Russell 1000 Index as their benchmark. **SPYG** and **VOOG** use the S&P 500 Growth Index for their benchmark and would be similar (but not identical) to **IWF**, **VONG** and **RWGV**. **IWM** \- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating. **VXUS** \- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10. **EEM** \- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com]( along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors. This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal. **EFA** \- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan. This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca. **S*****ector fund ETFs:*** **ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above. **ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile. * **ARKG** \- Genomic Revolution * **ARKF** \- Fintech * **ARKK** \- Disruptive Companies (broader market) * **ARKW** \- Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding) * **ARKQ** \- Robotics and artificial intelligence * **PRNT** \- 3D printing technology * **IZRL** \- disruptive companies based in Israel **XL series of funds**. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector: * **XLV** \- Health Care * **XLK** \- Technology * **XLY** \- Consumer Discretionary * **XLF** \- Financial * **XLU** \- Utilities * **XLE** \- Energy * **XLB** \- Materials * **XLC** \- Communications * **XLG** \- S&P Top 50 * **XLI** \- Industrial * **XLP** \- Consumer Staples * **XLRE** \- Real Estate **CLOUD COMPUTING:** **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance. Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**. Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller. **Aerospace and Defense:** XAR, ITA, PPA **Real Estate:** VNQ, FREL, SCHH, IYR, PSR, BBRE **Transportation:** FTXR, XTN, IYT, RGI, JETS **Oil/Energy:** IYE, FENY, VDE **Consumer Staples:** FSTA, VDC, IECS **Media/Entertainment:** IEME, PBS, PEJ, IYC **Robotics, AI, Innovative Technologies:** THNQ, ROBO, XITK, SKYY, GDAT **Semiconductors:** SOXX, QTEC, QTUM, SMH, FTXL **IT:** FTEC, VGT, IWY, IGM, FDN **Cyber Security:** HACK, CIBR, IHAK, BUG, FITE **Consumer Discretionary:** FDIS, VCR, IEDI, JHMC, IYC **5G, Connectivity:** FIVG, NXTG, WUGI **Self Driving EV:** IDRV, DRIV, MOTO **Gaming/Esports:** NERD, HERO, ESPO, GAMR, SOCL **Casinos/Gambling:** BETZ, BJK **Online Retail:** IBUY, EBIZ, ONLN, CLIX, GBUY, BUYZ **Utilities:** IDU, VPU, FUTY, RYU **Health Care:** FHLC, VHT, IYH **Medical Devices and Equipment:** IHI, IEHS, XHE &#x200B; **Other Unique ETFs, non-sector based:** **CHGX:** US Large Cap Fossil Fuel Free ETF **VIRS:** Biothreat Strategy ETF &#x200B; &#x200B; ***A nice portfolio might look something like this:*** **20% -** Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF **20%** \- VXUS - International **20%** \- IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund **10%** each in four sector funds of your choice *I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.

447,2021-01-17 06:13:12,swaggymedia,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit. **How is ""Hype"" calculated?** Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit **How can I use this list?** The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

(CRSR, NVDA, AMD, etc)","Microsoft removed their 12 month option for Xbox Live, and now only have up to a 6 month option priced at $59.99. This is double what the price for Xbox Live used to be. To this day, Xbox remains the only console that requires an Xbox Live membership to play free-to-play games, including games such as Warzone. PC gaming was already on the rise, I ditched my Xbox last year to build a PC of my own, but this imo would catalyze the migration off console towards PC gaming even further. Thoughts? EDIT: So I’m editing this as of 1/23 to add that Microsoft has done a complete 180 and decided no membership will be needed to play free to play games, and no price hike on Xbox Live either! I was almost shocked they flipped on this so quickly lol. Thanks for everyone’s inputs!",12.684659090909092
449,2021-02-19 11:08:19,bro8619,NEW TRADERS: The internet is loaded with bad advice on buying individual stocks—your core portfolio should be built on old principles,"All I see in Reddit, Twitter, and social media is bad advice for the flood of new traders getting into the market right now. For every random post you see of someone claiming to have made a fortune on an individual stock, there are 40 people who tried and failed, and just didn’t post about it. Most new traders see that the market is raging and think they can jump into investing and become rich in 3 months by just buying and selling off an initial $5k investment a few times. Here’s the reality: proper investing takes time (patience), discipline (holding), and work (research). For 90%+ of people, your best strategy is in ETFs. For 100% of people, your best strategy is putting the core of your portfolio in ETFs. Your investments in individual stocks should ONLY be a supplement—ie buying high conviction, high upside plays that won’t damage your portfolio’s stability if you lose. The number of people out there who seem to think a portfolio with 50% PLTR is a legitimate investment strategy is extremely alarming, and they are going to end up losing a lot of money. Maybe not on that stock, but on one of them as they continue down that path. If you want to invest, you should take the time to read John Bogle’s “little book of common sense investing” to understand why ETFs always beat 90%+ of investment strategies. Also everyone should read Benjamin Graham’s “Intelligent Investor”. If you don’t have time, why would you think you have time to invest? The distilled version is that the market always broadly goes up in the long term, buying and holding a diversified s&p500 ETF with very low fees (like VOO) is the surest way to guarantee your fair share of returns. Almost everyone on this sub would have better returns over 30 years if they did nothing but that. But of course, that isn’t fun for people. But know this—the market will come down from here. It is trading well above value. If your money is disproportionately in individual stocks, you have no guarantee of it coming back. If you’re new to investing out at least 90% of your money in VOO and leave it alone. Forever. The rest you can take shots at individual stocks with. When you add money to your portfolio, add at least 50% to VOO and then with the left over you can buy individual stocks. Do this for AT LEAST a year, but 3 would be better. If you’re experienced you don’t need me to tell you this but 60% of yours portfolio should still be in ETFs. Good luck out there. I don’t know when it will come down, but it will. EDIT: after some people calling me a “boomer” and questioning my selection, I’ll provide disclosures. It’s true that I do not own only ETFs. But I have been investing for a lot while. A bit over 60% of my portfolio is in ETFs or holding companies (BRKB) VGT VCR TTD BRKB VOO ARKG FKASX ROKU ARKF FUBO SHOP CRM PIN SQ MTCH PYPL FVRR Z DIS NFLX PTON NVDA CRWD DOCU ZM TWLO ABNB LMD WIX RDFN AI FSLY",9.232233044733045

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead. Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021. # **Stronger economic data could power stocks that thrive in a rebound in the week ahead - [(Source)]( ***** > A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead. ***** > In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates. ***** > While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound – financials, airlines and industrials – stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade. ***** > Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback. ***** > The S&P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week. ***** > The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday. ***** > He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off. ***** > “He’s going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. “It is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.” ***** > But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy. ***** > # Improving forecasts > Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales. ***** > Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December. ***** > The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week. ***** > ″[Powell’s] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He’s going to be supportive of the administration’s effort to get a big package through,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. ***** > # Key data during the week > Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy’s and TJX. ***** > Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday ***** > The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation. ***** > “I think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. ***** > He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus. ***** > “I think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,” he said. ***** > “The caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that’s going to go away sooner than we think,” Keon said. “Right now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That’s also due to the fact we’re likely to get a big stimulus package.” ***** > He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities. ***** > “I think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We’re still bullish. We’re still overweight stocks,” Keon said. ***** > He said a flood of money could hit the economy. ***** > “The size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,” Keon added. “Households now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.” ***** > He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. “You’re going to see an incredible boom.” ***** # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!]( # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!]( # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!]( # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!]( # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( # **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!]( ***** > # Value Outperforming Growth But Only for Large Caps > While the S&P 500 traded lower today, value stocks had a strong finish to the week. Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear. > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( > Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average. > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( > Value's outperformance today only applied to large caps, though. While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN). > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( ***** > # Industrial Metals Shining Bright > While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals—as proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index—are up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94). > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( > Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way. > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( > Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains. As shown in the charts below, both year to date and over the past year, these three metals have risen the most with tin in the number one spot in both respects. > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( ***** > # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak > “Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying. > Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage “stairs up, elevator down” certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days. > The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn’t looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned? > **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it’s difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently. > **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in “stay at home” themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months: > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( > **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. “It’s our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,” noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Drawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.” If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year’s volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold. > Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession. > Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December—ordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales—consumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau—the most in seven months—and greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey. > Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores: > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( > “Fiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.” > Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January’s retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn’t receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns. > Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4–4.5% to 5–5.5%. Yesterday’s retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target—and may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021. > However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden’s fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves. ***** > # Tech Leading in New Highs > The S&P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year. > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( > On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector. > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( ***** > # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead > One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points. > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( > We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week. > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( ***** > # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness? > Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower. > This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected. > We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture. > ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( ***** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!]( ***** Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers: ***** > # ***Monday 2.22.21 Before Market Open:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]( > # ***Monday 2.22.21 After Market Close:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!]( ***** > # ***Tuesday 2.23.21 Before Market Open:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]( > # ***Tuesday 2.23.21 After Market Close:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!]( > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!]( ***** > # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 Before Market Open:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!]( > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!]( > # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 After Market Close:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!]( > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!]( > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!]( ***** > # ***Thursday 2.25.21 Before Market Open:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!]( > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!]( > # ***Thursday 2.25.21 After Market Close:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!]( > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!]( > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!]( ***** > # ***Friday 2.26.21 Before Market Open:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]( ***** > # ***Friday 2.26.21 After Market Close:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]( (NONE.) ***** > # NVIDIA Corp. $597.06 **NVIDIA Corp.

451,2021-02-26 08:16:35,civgarth,Don't give up before you get good.,"Dig through my history. This isn't a self-therapy post after a down week. I've been doing this for a long time. The reason people fail at this is that their opening trades are way too big for their accounts. And when they are wrong, they are set-back so far that after a string of losing trades, they simply cannot afford to continue. Let's say I have $1,000,000 in my account. Each trade I open up is rarely above $30,000 to $50,000 dollars or 3% to 5%. And on a $30,000 to $50,000 trade, I'm perfectly happy if I make around $3,000 to $5,000 per trade for the WEEK or even BIWEEKLY! Now that does not seem particularly impressive but if I make 6 trades and 3 of them swing the right way, while the 3 others don't, it's still a pretty good week in terms of absolute dollars. On the 3 where I am wrong, I exit at -3% no matter what happens. This ensures that wins on average are at least 3x bigger than my losses. Also, I only actively trade 15% - 20% of my account. Profits from trades go into long-term positions that I never sell and only add to. Now let's say you start with $20,000. This means each trade should really only be about $1,000. So you're thinking, ""What? I can't make a living day trading generating a $100 a week per trade on a good week!!"" No. You can't and you shouldn't. This is why folks should not quit their day job to do this. I didn't quit my day job to do this until 10 years after I started doing this. And here's why. The professional trader and fund managers are not intrinsically smarter than you. They traditionally had more timely information. That gap has been narrowed with the internet. Where professionals and funds beat you is scale. Here's an exaggerated example. If I can buy 100,000 shares and you can only buy 100, and both of us need $50 today to pay bills, I have virtually no risk whereas you need to hope for a 50% daily return. Most traders who do this at home for income do not make a huge amount of money. I certainly don't. But a large account built over time allows the trader to risk less and less to maintain the same income year over year. Huge funds make shit trades every day. But each trade is less than a fraction of 1% of their book. So stop beating yourself up. The reason you're not doing well is your account is simply too small and you're relying way too much on luck. It takes time and dedication to accumulate enough money. Stop telling yourself you should be further ahead as that thinking will kill you. A lot of you literally started a few months ago. Sometimes you'll have windfalls. Most of the time, trading is boring as shit. So don't feel bad if you're not getting it right away. You have to tune out the posts where you see people posting wins and losses as that will get you to start gambling instead of trading. A lot of you folks are not 'bad' at this. For some reason, you've just assumed you were 'good' without enough evidence. Also, I'm not particularly stoic or emotionless on big wins and losses. The long-term positions in my account all got hammered these last few weeks. I will still get pumped or upset and I share with a trading buddy. Find yourself a trading buddy. TLDR because I am apparently not clear: don't feel bad if you're not successful yet. You need to get to a decent account size before this starts to click. Edit: you guys are nuts and maybe I'm to blame. I said here is an example. I even explicitly say I lose half the time. What on earth did I say that implies I'm a trillionaire?! Edit: I used perfectly round numbers for examples. Come on man. The message is you're struggling because you don't have scale not ""I'm a superstar."" In addition, I didn't start from zero and never implied that I did. Edit: Holy crap, I even said 'lets say I had..."" to start the example. The message is about scale and needing time to accumulate. What on earth are you reading that I'm not seeing? Y'all need to chill out. Does it make you feel better to hear me say I also lost a bunch of money on paper this week as well? Edit: never said I was good at stock picking. The only thing I will take credit for is limiting losses.",3.8184663536776227
452,2021-03-18 06:37:14,Fountainheadusa,NVIDIA - $NVDA is a great long term investment,"I bought NVDA today, adding to a position I’d initiated in 2018 and have continuously added to on most dips. **The Bull Case** * A great long term investment as demand for GPU’s will remain high for the next decade * User markets such as data center, gaming and auto continue to grow * Leader in its market segments – best in class products * Gaming - Huge pricing power because of innovative, high quality product improvements such as ray tracing * Strong competitive advantage with its CUDA software stack * Mellanox acquisition also gives it a serious competitive advantage in Data Center * 15% Rev and 20% earnings growth expected per year in the next 5 years. * The ARM deal, if it goes through will be a huge shot in the arm for NVDA as a strategic near monopoly in licensing * NVDA has bought a majority of ARM with its own stock at $485 per share. The equity dilution is only 7%. **The Bear Case** * Stretched valuation at 40X Jan -22 earnings and 20X Jan-22 sales * Data center GPU users such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are investing heavily to build their own chips. * Crypto revenue is not sustainable * Post covid environment may reduce gaming and therefore GPU demand **Challenges** The ARM deal may not go through The chances of several governments, especially the U.K and China passing the deal are low. Several ARM customers have raised concerns about Nvidia likely misusing/abusing its position as the default licensor, forcing customers to use its own chips. With these concerns there will be heightened governmental and regulatory scrutiny into NVDA. There are two interesting articles on the ARM deal. [Here’s the one from Forbes]( the author is hopeful that the deal goes through and why. She believes that governments like the US will push through to gain and maintain its competitive advantage in A.I. The second is from Trading Places Research and called Nvidia and ARM: All About Control. It’s from Seeking Alpha and why the ARM acquisition makes sense for NVIDIA. Here’s the gist in the author’s own words. >“But in the end, NVIDIA is trying to do what Apple does regularly, and is so very successful with: control the core technologies behind its products. NVIDIA wants to build a data center behemoth built around the CPU-GPU-DPU-AI stack. They control three of the four layers, and the Arm acquisition would give them the fourth, and most important layer in the stack. They can build this Goliath licensing Arm technology, but they would be dependent on someone else’s roadmap. That someone else is mostly in the business of selling smartphone SoC IP, and is most interested in the future of IoT. > >But again, this is precisely what is going to scare Arm’s customers so much. The entire smartphone ecosystem is dependent on the continued development of those cores, and if the company is shifting its attention to the data center, the rest may languish down the road. Those customers may even start looking at RISC-V. They have at least 18 months to mull it over, which is a lifetime in tech.” **Valuation** Sure, the stock's expensive at 530, but 3 years out NVDA earns about $24 a share, getting the PE down to 22, which is not bad for a 20% grower.

It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include: * Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security * Cloud Computing * Ai * Advanced Robotics / automation * Big-data * 3D printing * Quantum computing (hypothetically) * Robotic process automation (RPA) * Semi-conductors * Biotechnology / Healthcare * IoT manufacturing * Renewable energy * Manufacturing / Mining Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few. since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase. **Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?** **Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap. &#x200B; * **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security** * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD** * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security. * **Cloudflare - $NET** * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare * **BlackBerry - $BB** * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector. * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention. * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data. * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity. * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality. &#x200B; * **Cloud Computing** * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But as @[ArtakhaPrime]( mentioned: Amazon and Microsoft ""are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent."" * **Amazon - $AMZN** * **Microsoft - $MSFT** * **Cloudflare - $NET - See DD in previous category** * **Fastly - $FSLY - Need DD** * **Digital Ocean - $DOCN - Need DD** * **DataDog - $DDOG - Need DD** &#x200B; * **Ai** * **C3Ai - $AI - Need DD** * **Nvidia - NVDA - Need DD** * **Intel - INTC - Need DD** &#x200B; * **Advanced Robotics / automation** * **Teradyne - $TER** * Focusses on industrial automation, semiconductor testing, wireless testing and storage testing.

Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences. * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD** &#x200B; * **3D Printing** * **Desktop Metal - $DM** * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors. * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time. * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed.

There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([ thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do. * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult. This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([ * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit. Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.

NVDA is shown being valued at $370 billion and AMD at $97 billion. That means NVDA is worth almost 4 times as much with only 1.5 times the revenue. Why is this?

470,2021-09-08 21:17:51,sin1sback,First Ever Stock Analysis (NVDA/Nvidia DD) *PLEASE CRITIQUE),"tock: Nvidia Ticker: $NVDA **#1: Valuation Multiples (Fundamental Analysis)** To begin the analysis, Valuation. As a starting point to find the valuation of a company, let’s use the valuation multiple: EV/EBITDA. EV/EBITDA allows us to understand what the company is earning relative to what the company is worth. Why does this matter? It allows us to compare the company’s average to their industry average and other companies within the industry. Again, why does this matter? It measures what the individual is willing to pay for their earnings. So let’s break it down EV stands for “Enterprise Value”. Enterprise value is made up of the company’s equity, plus total debt, minus their cash. This gives us a better understanding of the company’s value of operations as it factors in both debt and cash. Comparative to just market cap which only considers the value of the company’s shares. So we have nvidia’s equity: 556687, their total debt: 12791, and their cash: 19782 (measured in billions) so we have the EV: 549.69B (information gathered by Merrill Lynch) Now that we have the EV, what is EBITDA? EBITDA or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization is simply putted as the measure of profitability. Like EV, its just a way of understanding a business’s profitability better than net income can. Debt to Equity ratio, Free Cash Flow Yield, P/E Ratio are also helpful, but we aren’t going there. Formula: So we’ll take the Net Income of Nvidia which is Earnings before Interest, then we’ll add interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Based off of a 10-k provided by the SEC, the Net Income: 4,332, Interest: 184, Taxes: 77, D and A: 1,098 EBITDA: 5.69B (in billions) So we have the EV/EBITDA of 96.2 What do we do with this information? We can now compare it to the industry average. You’re looking for them to trade underneath the average. The Software and AI EV/EBITDA average is 106, so Nvidia is trading underneath the industry average. **Historical Price Target(s) + Business Fundamentals (Fundamental Analysis)** Before Nvidia’s stock split (4:1) Nvidia was trading at a high of $750+. While considering we are in an eight year exponential tech bull run, I still think Nvidia was room to run back to close or even as high as its prior high. Tesla stock was trading at around $2,213 before their split of 5:1. Then Tesla ran from $80 to almost $900 in a single year. Of course that was attributed to the bull run/short squeeze, but for Nvidia that could mean something. For Tesla to 10x in a year, isn’t hard for nvidia to 2x or even 3x from its current trading price based on their prior movements. Tesla’s 5 year gain in percentages is 1,838% while Nvidias 5 year gain is 1.401%. Their historical price movement is very similar so it wouldn’t be surprising is nvidia followed Tesla on a smaller, slower scale. Besides that, Nvidias business is huge for the retail consumption. Bitcoin miners and Gamers have been on a ramped uptrend for the past years and is ever growing. The main graphics card usage is for gamers and miners. So the disruption of graphics card and the demand will be huge for the foreseeable future. **#2: Technical Analysis** Many people disagree with TA. Most say it is all bullshit and that people are wasting their time fooling around drawing lines on their chart. I 100% disagree with that those statements. The market is mainly based on psychology. The main way a stock price moves is when buyers buy up or when sellers sell down. So when more buyers think the stock will go up vs. the amount of sellers who think the stock will go down, the stock moves upwwards. Of course it isn’t as black and white, but that’s the premise. So some TA evidently becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Daily Chart: Sorry, chart is supposed to be here, but stocks doesn't allow. I can see Nvidia moving in two different ways within the next few weeks. Option A: We see nvidia break the flag and break above the all time high of $230 and make a new high Or Option B: We get rejected off the all time high or fail the break out and head down to the $206-207 support. But Nvidia isn’t a short term play, Tesla took a year to 10x so this is definitely a 1-3 year play at least. **How I’m playing Nvidia** Yes, I’m in nvidia. I wanted to make this so I can get criticism on my first Due Diligence and what I can fix or what I can add. I know this is super choppy and all over the place and I’m sure I missed more important things, but this is where I’m starting. I have 20% of my portfolio allocated to Nvidia. 12% in shares and 8% in long ATM calls dating in 2023. Price Target: $300-$500+ depending on how fast the stock grows.

First, I have been contemplating buying puts on NVDA for about a month now, and it's kept on going up and the only reason I haven't pulled the trigger yet is because I feel like I'm missing something so let me explain my case, then you explain why I'm wrong. &#x200B; Ok, first, NVDA is a 550 billion dollar company with 20 billion in revenue and a P/E of nearly 80, and a forward P/E of 60. This is literally SENILE, in 2000, when Intel was all the shit, as a 300 billion dollar company it had a P/E of 40, and now 20 years later it's still down while it doubled it's revenue and 4x it's profit. So, with NVDA trading at a multiple of 80, even if let's say they 3x their eps in the next 5 years which is an extremely absurd assumption as they've already had a ton of growth fueled from covid, they would have 9 dollars of EPS and looking at today's stock price, if it stayed the same they would still be trading at a multiple of 24 which is ridiculous if they somehow just 3x their revenue in a matter of 5 years. Looking at all the growth catalysts I would find it only somewhat reasonable if they 2x their profit which would give them 6 dollars of EPS and keep them at a P/E of 40. That is once again Intels multiple at the peak of 2000 when it was also half the market cap. Lastly, NVDA has gone up nearly 100% from it's lows in February for two reasons, slightly better than expected earnings and a stock split, none of which would justify that movement. So, that's what I'm thinking, I HAVE TO BE MISSING SOMETHING RIGHT?, why does this seem so overvalued as such a large company, can someone please explain because if not those 2024 140 strike price puts are looking real sexy.",2.739463601532567

""The third quarter was outstanding, with record revenue,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Demand for NVIDIA AI is surging, driven by hyperscale and cloud scale-out, and broadening adoption by more than 25,000 companies. NVIDIA RTX has reinvented computer graphics with ray tracing and AI, and is the ideal upgrade for the large, growing market of gamers and creators, as well as designers and professionals building home workstations."" The company also issued a bullish forecast for revenue in the current quarter ending in January. Nvidia said it expects to report around $7.4 billion in the current quarter, ending in January, higher than analyst expectations of $6.86 billion. (I took the guidance from here)",15.761904761904763
483,2021-11-18 15:38:59,Jodyhighrolex,I Analyzed $NVDA So You Don't Have To,"Hello everyone, Today I will be analyzing $NVDA otherwise known as Nvidia. I also have done analysis for other companies as well. Feel free to check them out on my profile! For those that don’t know, Nvidia is a company based in the United States that designs graphics, processing units, and chip units. They reported earnings for Q3 on 11/17. They did good overall reporting revenue of $7.1 billion, which is a 50.1% Increase from the same quarter last year, and beat estimates by $290 Million. They also reported record Data Center revenue of $2.94 Billion, and record Gaming revenue of $3.22 billion. At the time of this post, NVDA is sitting at just about $316.75, gaining over $24 today alone. Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up. They are up $93.85 in the last month alone! During the press release, they talked about a lot of great things NVDA has done or is in the process of doing. For example NVDA discussed plans to build something which they call Earth-2, Earth-2 is an AI supercomputer which will be made specifically to predict climate change. Another cool thing they’re doing which I’m sure some of you have heard of is the Omniverse avatar, Omniverse is a technology platform which generates interactive AI avatars. The avatars that are created through this platform will be 3-D. According to NVDA they will be able to see and speak. The avatar will be able to talk about a very wide range of subjects. In the Automotive sector, They released AI technology which allows safe autonomous driving on streets and a computer architecture and sensor set made specifically for self-driving systems. I could go way more in depth on the other great advancements this company is doing but these were my favorite and I think you guys get the point. Now let's talk about their evaluation… 1. Nvidia beat expectations, and they had pretty strong revenue growth in Q3, however, percentage wise, they did fall short compared to their semiconductor competitors, such as AMD and TSM. Their EBITDA margins are also looking pretty good. However, compared to other competitors in the space, once again they fall short, other companies in the space captured a larger portion of the market. Overall, Nvidia’s multiples are leading more than any other company. 2. Management believes that there is a lot more growth in store. They are growing at a tremendous rate right now. In the earnings call, The CEO of NVDA said that they are finally transitioning into becoming a software company. Nvidia is the dominant leader in creating GPU hardware and now they are also becoming a leader in AI tools and virtualization technology. NVDA wants “Every transaction that goes over the internet to touch a GPU” While also selling the best software available to utilize their GPU’s. 3. Nvidia's current market cap is very substantial. This stock has had extreme hype as of recently, especially because of the anticipation regarding the Omniverse. It’s definitely possible that this company could see great growth over the coming years. Especially since they basically have a monopoly on GPU hardware and also very extensive experience in visualization and AI, but they will be fighting a lot of competition from companies that want in on the action. Furthermore, Uk regulators have been pushing back on Nvidia’s $40 billion acquisition of the chip designer Arm and if this transaction is hindered then it could put a pretty big crater in Nvidia's plans. Overall, I believe their company is very overvalued right now and people should wait for a dip if they want to buy into this company. I hope you all learned something from my analysis of this company. Thanks for reading everyone! **EBITDA**, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization",21.73139880952381
484,2021-12-01 01:20:48,PeekingPotato,Is NVDA a good buy right now?,"Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I´ll try to do that and post it here. That´s my first analysis for NVDA. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything. Today we will look through the basics of NVIDIA´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for NVDA´s stock using discounted free cashflow. This is not financial advice and I do not own shares in NVIDIA. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence. First let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **45%** of their sales comes from **Gaming**. The **Data Center** makes up around **41%**. Another **8%** comes from **Professional Visualization**. Then there is **3%** from **OEM**, and another **2%** from **Automotive**. For the valuation: We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 9,2%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for NVDA´s stock of **$327 per share**. But because we have to account for **NVDA´s equity** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$311 per share**. Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that. With NVDA´s price being at **$326** **per share** right now, it´s kind of fairly valued. That´s why I think buying *heavily* might not be a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount. **Where I see NVDA´s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$868 per share** which is definitely higher than what it is now. **What I´ll do.** I believe NVIDIA is here to stay. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why, although the price is not exactly where I would want it to be (I want to include a margin of safety), I will maybe start to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I won´t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. Thank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.",27.11904761904762
485,2021-12-04 05:47:49,Alternative_Tower_38,Has anyone tried a strategy where they do the exact opposite of everything Cramer says,"So, I was just reading the Intelligent Investor (updated 2004 version) and there's a paragraph about how ""In February 2000, hedge-fund manager James J. Cramer"" was basically pumping and hyping internet stocks and that putting $10000 into his picks would have left you with $597 by the end of 2002. (Truly impressive even for me having lost 52% on CD Projekt) Now there's memes about him saying he wants as much DIDI shares as possible and I'm sure there are many other examples. (I'm not suggesting anyone can tell if a stock will be delisted or not unless you work for the government).

486,2021-12-08 06:36:07,Jealous-Ride-7303,Why is NVDA so richly valued?,"Hi everyone, I'd like to preface this by saying that I'm a new investor around 3-months and that I'm not dogging anyone's investment decisions. I primarily invest by DCA into ETFs like SPY, QQQ and DIA. I've also decided to branch out by nibbling on individual stocks within the QQQ. I find NVDA interesting and hold a small position from when it was $226/share, I think it has a good business model, a good history of profitability and it has an edge over other chipmakers in the sense that they're the best at graphics technology. However, I can't understand why people continue buying into NVDA stock at current values where the PE is 95+ NVDA has the potential to grow no doubt, but does it really have the potential to grow at a rate that justifies such a rich valuation today? Or is it just that traders/WSB types are playing games with the stock? Wouldn't a better investment be to look elsewhere in the semiconductor industry for better deals? I like MU (PE: 17) because RAM and storage is needed universally for pretty much anything that needs a chip, AMAT (PE: 26) because they make equipment for foundries which means if NVDA wins, AMAT wins. Investing in TSM (PE: 31) might be good for similar reasons as AMAT. I acknowledge that I don't know too much about investing (obviously) and don't even know necessarily much about reading up on fundamentals. I mainly look at PE, PEG and look at the historical gains of the stock and company. I'd just like to have a better understanding. Cheers everyone.",24.84343434343435
487,2021-12-14 16:12:44,OhioBaseball,Long-term NVDA investor speaking here,"I've owned NVDA for years. I've always believed in the potential even if it was volatile (trust me, there's been some major swings). I had written calls at $250 months ago before the hard run up. I sold a majority of my shares that the price. I had followed this wonderful company's stock price every day for years. It honestly kind of felt like it was my child. I watched it grow up, I believed in it and it went on to do wonderful things, but at $250 it was moving out of the house and going away to college in another state (Stanford on full-ride, of course). Everything it did since then I'm not surprised how great, but he's on his own now. If things ever get too bad ($200/share??), we're going to let him stay at the house and wait for a more sunny day so he can flourish again. There's a lot of big buyers out there that feel this way. Short-term downside will be tolerable because there's a lot of incremental buyers that still love this company but let it go because sometimes valuations get too high. My point is if you believe in the technology, there's going to absolutely be volatility because its been like this forever, but its a part of the investment -- nothing goes straight up. Its hard to stomach sometimes but its part of the game and smart, well-run companies are going to make it in USA like nowhere else in the world.",21.597117794486216

490,2021-12-19 15:57:21,skilliard7,NVDA- Sell if you still hold it,"Nvidia is currently trading at a price to earnings of 85, which is astronomical. It is priced at this level because investors believe earnings will continue to grow very quickly. If earnings don't continue to grow substantially YoY, the stock will tank. However, Nvidia faces a perfect storm in 2022 that will likely severely impact their earnings: - Eth3reum is scheduled to go proof of stake in H1 2022. This means that millions of GPUs, no longer capable of earning a profit in excess of electricity costs will hit the secondary market and undercut prices of new GPUs. - Intel is rumored to introduce their new dedicated GPUs in H1 2022, which will compete with Nvidia on the low to mid end. - Rising interest rates in general are likely to have an impact on growth stocks. - AMD's upcoming GPUs are rumored to be 3x as fast as their current generation flagship. If these rumors turn out to be true, Nvidia's dominance in the industry is threatened. Nvidia doesn't really have much upside from here to justify holding it in excess of market cap weights, but there is substantial downside risk if any of these risks pan out.",15.329768270944744

I want to hold for long term but if it were to sink to $220 or something next year I'd rather sell now and buy back in at $220 a share obviously since there's no tax implication. Of course some think it could sink below $200 also. So obviously I could take my profits and buy even more shares at a lower entry price. I do have 20% cash right now but that doesn't negate the fact that I would be better off selling current shares at $309 and buying back in at $220 or $190. What should I do?,12.357142857142858
492,2021-12-29 13:22:17,karnoculars,To all of you who are red this year while the S&P500 is up 30%,"Lately I keep hearing the same old narrative from beat-down investors on r/stocks who are down YTD even when SPY is up 30%: ""everything is down this year, the indexes are just being propped up by mega-cap tech companies like AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA"". They go on to say that just because they are down this year and indexes are up, it's actually not that bad because the mega-caps are hiding the true state of the market. Well, let's look at the data shall we... Here are the YTD gains of a whole bunch of indexes from all the industries that I could think of, most of which don't have many of the aforementioned mega-caps in it: VGT: +32.99% (Technology) XLF: +34.87% (Financial) XLE: +47.15% (Energy) XLI: +22.38& (Industrials) XLV: +24.99% (Healthcare) DBC: +43.37% (Commodities) PAVE: +37.90% (Infrastructure) AVUV: +42.18 (Small Cap Value) SCHD: +27.87% (Dividends) SMH: +43.21% (Semiconductors) ITA: +13.16% (Aerospace and Defense) TRVL: +6.82% (Travel) As can be seen, every major sector of the market is green for the year. Even travel and aerospace, two of the hardest hit sectors, are up YTD. Every single other sector is up at least 20%. It would take an objectively bad investment plan to pick only losers out of this sea of green. So can we please stop with the BS that a handful of companies are propping up a dying market. If you are down this year, you really need to review your investing decisions because you are almost certainly investing in companies with poor fundamentals that have been driven entirely by hype and/or trading options in a way that is pure gambling. I just hope that you are taking the right lessons away from this year. Please consider putting the majority of your money into broad market index funds. Wishing everyone a successful 2022!",-1.3389850889850876

I put the proceeds (they were all long shares) in PG for the new year. Analysts are saying that PEs will contract this year as the FED raises rates and that things like NVDA will take a big hit. Don't get me wrong, I'm still long NVDA and my cost basis is $127 and it's still 3% of my portfolio, but I feel the share price WILL go lower and if it hits 200 to 230 or so I'll probably add some more shares. Also, analysts are predicting things like consumer staples will fare well this year and so I thought a nice balance would be to add some PG for a little stability.

I think it’s price right now is pretty fair for the value that they offer but who knows I could be wrong.

Then we had the announcement Intel, Micron, and Analog Devices joined the Semiconductor Alliance, announcing an agreement to accelerate chip R&D and prototyping to build a more robust domestic industry, on the same day congress was briefed on economic and national security vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of domestic chip production. Not to mention the UCIe 1.0 announcement earlier, in which AMD, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Samsung, and TSMC work together. Intel is playing a key role by “donating” the initial specification.

I've been selling it between $304 and $260 and haven't bought any back and plan to buy at around $180.** I'm a buy and hold investor and most of my gains have come from long term positions in stocks such as NVDA, ADBE, AAPL, PYPL and GOOG, to name a few. Having said that, I did take profits when valuations got stretched, PYPL and ADBE are two cases where I've got rid of 80% of my holdings because future growth looked subdued compared to their earnings and sales multiples. In Nvidia's case this is an important indication that growth may decline some in the next few quarters, after torrid growth in the last two years. [ However, I still think NVDA's long term growth story in datacenter, autos and metaverse is largely intact and **then some**, but in the current market environment where inflation and high interest rates are going to drive multiples down - it would be more prudent to enter only after there is enough margin of safety. **At a price of $180, NVDA's 2025 fiscal year forward PE's and P/S ratios come down to 20 and 9, respectively.

Also assume that one already has other plays like value, oil, etc. e.g. I am not asking if these stocks are overpriced and if we should instead buy CVX or HAL, etc. NVDA has AI, which appears to still be at an early stage and has unrealized potential. However, it is unclear how much of that potential is real and how much is hype. If we get a bear market, NVDA will drop but might come back once the AI potential is realized, especially if the AI is needed for the event triggering the bear market (e.g. making smart weapons to combat Russia, accelerating green technologies to combat climate change, etc.). GOOGL also has AI and some other plays like Waymo, but GOOGL remains mostly advertising. If we do get a recession or a bear market, GOOGL could get hit hard and might also be slower to recover. MSFT seems the most stable of the three, but I'm not sure if the growth will be as high going forward. Seems like most businesses already use Office and while MSFT could raise the price, there does not appear to be as much expansion in terms of brand new accounts.

516,2022-04-20 21:33:00,FastAssSister,Tech Stocks Are Absurdly Cheap Now: putting my money where my mouth is,"Buckle in. Investing isn't easy, and yet people are--and always will--try to act like it is. Just like every other period in stock market history, retail 'investors' are being lazy and emotional and valuing businesses based off the direction their prices are heading rather than long term fundamentals. Volatility is the price you pay for performance. Thinking it's time to sell tech and buy Kellogg, with corporate profits RISING, will get you into deep trouble. No, being a good investor has absolutely nothing to do with being 'contrarian'. It just so happens that retail is too lazy and emotional to notice that prices tend to head fake away from where people should be buying at any given timeframe. Sometimes these head fakes point to different asset classes, other times to different assets within any given class. Right now, it's both. People think tech is in 2001 territory strictly because of price action, when we are in literally the opposite place outside a handful of overvalued and overhyped names; and people think bond yields are becoming attractive, when bonds are in the worst bear market in years (though this could change at any time considering the overreaction we've seen in Fed rate predictions). **This is precisely when you should be buying reasonably priced tech with strong cash flows, pricing power, quality earnings growth, barriers to entry (either a difficult industry to break into or an outright moat, which is very rare and hard to predict but** ***Facebook has one*****), network effects, and demand inelasticity.** Your stocks don't have to have all of these elements, but the more, the merrier. **\*\*\*** **Here's some oversimplified but VERY true deductive reasoning that 99% of 'investors' fail to heed:** \-Companies with higher earnings growth deserve higher valuations \-Companies with better pricing power deserve higher valuations \-Companies with higher quality earnings growth deserve higher valuations \-Netflix and Facebook are still growth companies, their earnings quality is only improving, and they have IMMENSE pricing power that they've only begun to tap into \-Proctor & Gamble has a 40% higher relative valuation than Netflix \-CAMPBELL'S SOUP has a higher valuation than Facebook \-So-called 'investors' firmly believe that staples are the place to be right now, because 'interest rates' and 'inflation'. **Okay...** \-Corporate profits drive stock prices--literally in lock step--over the long run \-Inflation is good for corporate profits \-Inflation requires higher interest rates \-Higher interest rates are a headwind for stocks \-Higher interest rates ARE A LITERAL CATASTROPHE FOR BONDS \-Holding cash *is basically taking a financial gun and pointing it at your face and pulling the trigger* \-The answer is to own quality assets, which are companies with strong cash flows, moats, network effects, etc. **Millions of retail investors are absolutely convinced that tech is overvalued--but it's not because of poor fundamentals. Honestly, it's not even because of inflation, interested rates, or Ukraine. It's simply because prices are going down.** Do yourself a favor. Look at sentiment from one year ago today. Facebook to $600 was a done deal. Netflix was overpriced, and I wouldn't have bought it at near $700, but if anyone thought we would be below $230, we'd be minting new billionaires by the second because of their OTM puts. Amazon is more underpriced than I've maybe ever seen based off what we can easily see (the market has never understood Amazon, and AWS ALONE is clearly a multitrillion dollar valuation by 2030). **FACTS:** \-**Amazon** PE is lowest ever while its future core businesses--AWS and ads (they are doing more ad revenue than YOUTUBE now, and AWS brings in more profit than any business line now, so if you think Amazon is a retail business you should be buying index funds...)--are growing at 40% or more. \-**Facebook** PE is lowest ever--last time this happened was three years ago, their stock price crashed to $131, and with this incredible overreaction they're STILL up 54% since then. \-And now to my favorite part: **Netflix** is at its lowest valuation since the 2000s and perhaps ever--who cares before then, it wasn't Netflix, it was a frickin' mail-order DVD company. Its PEG is .84. Its earnings have plateaued on SEVERAL occasions only to leap, over and over again. Just like Facebook, they were bound to hit a plateau for their core use base at some point. But if you think that means they're done growing out earnings--not to mention expanding other business lines, like Amazon did with AWS and ads, and Microsoft did with Azure--you need to ask yourself whether you have enough knowledge and experience here. In a way, investing really isn't that hard. **You just have to actually buy businesses and not obsess over the value of your portfolio every day**. If you do that, you're smart enough to see that tech could fall another 30% right now--and it would only present an even better buying opportunity with even more upside. As Buffett said after 2008, he might've been early, but he still got rich. And trust me, buying now might be early, but it will be INSANELY lucrative. SO SO SO many companies are just dirt cheap. People think DropBox is a shitty cloud business, when its top line is growing double digits and they're priced like Campbell's f'kn Soup. People think GoPro is a shitty camera business when it has begun adding software with INCREDIBLE margins and is growing rapidly again. Upstart is literally the only company in the market with the triple crown--triple digit growth, massively profitable, and BUYING BACK STOCK--yet its price was cut by 80%. There are just so many tech companies getting caught up in this indiscriminate selling, as if they're DoorDash or Rivian or Nikola or Snowflake, or any of the incredibly overpriced businesses, good or bad, that deserved to be cut in half. People calling this tech bubble 2.0 are either too young to understand what the tech bubble was, or too stupid to understand what it was. This is the literal opposite of the tech bubble. We have companies with tens of billions in FCF being repriced as if they're going out of business. Earnings are GROWING. We are in a BOOM cycle--IN TECH. You are being fooled--AGAIN. During the tech bubble, it's not that companies weren't making money...**THEY WEREN'T EVEN BRINGING IN REVENUE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE?** Not even the most overvalued companies today (aside from Rivian and Nikola) can attest to such an atrocity. I pity the people who need to see instant green in their portfolios, and I hope to see your sea of !Remind Me! posts for five to ten years from now. **For those of you who take anything away from this post, here's putting my money where my mouth is:** Here's my portfolio weighted by notional impact--i.e. ITM calls carry more leverage despite moving the same amount as 100 shares of a stock, or ATM short puts I've written to buy at a lower cost basis or just hold the premium. (**I plan on opening a Netflix position at some point soon.**) **$UPST:** **16.9%** (Pretty much the perfect stock: AI lending company that's barely unaffected by rates and loan origination volume; already profitable by a mile; reinvesting capital into massive TAMs; and already has permission from the board to buy back stock. Hope you don't judge a stock by its PE because that's how you miss pretty much every single winner, from Amazon to Salesforce to Netflix.) **$CIM:** **7.7%** (Retracing like a tech stock right now with fortress balance sheet and 12% dividend yield--and climbing. Chimera did even better following the pandemic after cutting its dividend yield, which made for the perfect time to buy.) **$OSTK:** **7.54%** (Retail furniture business that's stealing market share from Wayfair and growing rapidly yet with a stock price selling as if it's going out of business--oh yeah, and they've got Medici Ventures, which is priced at zero.) **$Z: 6.56%** (Vertically integrated media business of which people seem to have zero understanding. It's literally in the best shape it's ever been: shed of its worst business segment and raising capital from home inventory; growing at over 20%; and selling at a 75%+ discount...yet people hate it infinitely more than when it was up near $200...LOL) **$AMZN: 5.97%** (Enough said above. This is a multitrillion dollar business that checks every box listed above selling at less than half its true value.) **$APPS:** **5.25%** (Growing triple digits, profitable, and with insane barriers to entry--not quite Upstart, but this is a 5x play.) **$URI:** **5.12%** (Picks and shovels play for infrastructure boom ahead. Someone will pass a version of build back better, and this company is a gem even without government subsidy. Also, United Rentals helps balance out my insanely tech-weighted portfolio just a tad bit, though that's not at all why I bought it--because I could care less how much money I lose in the short term to maximize long term gains.) **$FB:** **5.2%** (The greatest network company of all time--a company whose business model will never be repeated--is trading at a multiple 7% lower than the Campbell f'kin Soup Company.

Like several other stocks on this list, earnings give a HUGE temporary boost because of how incredibly strong they are, only to watch the gains wither away because of indiscriminate selling in the tech space.) **$AMAT: 3.14%** (Picks and shovels play for the semiconductor bull market that will last for decades to come.

I don't know, but in addition to what was mentioned above, this company is set to buy back half it's MFing float. Like, are you kidding me?) **$NVDA: 2.61%** (Only reason I don't have a bigger allocation is because NVIDIA puts my total semi allocation at around 9%. I also owned Intel for a hot second before I rolled it into other plays. Think The whole space is going to continue to skyrocket, but no one has the creativity or talent that NVIDIA does.) **$BNTX: 2.6%** (The market thinks that this company stumbled upon vaccines, that covid is ending tomorrow, and that they have no other pipeline. The reality is that BioNTech is set to sell billions more in vaccines for a long time coming, and all of this is an incredibly massive tailwind to their rare diseases pipeline.) **$WBD: 2.22%** (It's always funny when some jackoff at BoA comes out with a report about how the merger between Discovery and Warner Brothers will create synergies that make this a $45 stock--6 months after the deal is announced. The stock rocketed above $30, then was indiscriminately sold off back to where it started--for no reason. The market is so efficient.) **$GPRO: 2.2%** (As mentioned above, this has become a software company with total control over its market and prices. 96% of action cameras in America are GoPros.

Personally think the Slack purchase is being totally swept under the rug. It's just that time of the cycle when you're supposed to doubt Benioff.) **$NLST: 1.33%** (Very unknown memory company with massive lawsuits against a bevy of huge companies and great prospects outside those lawsuits. They settled the lawsuit with SK Hynix and still have pending cases for patent infringement against the likes of Samsung, Micron, and Google--all of which are entirely legitimate.) **$AMRS: 0.8%** (A deep future play for molecules-as-a-function. This one is very nuanced and I'm getting tired of writing. You'd have to look into this one yourself to truly understand the importance of synthetic, sustainable molecules used in the place of limited and/or endangered organics at far cheaper prices across the cost spectrum.) **$SFT: 0.29%** (Kind of a random little lottery bet on a company with a market cap lower than its fourth quarter revenue alone. But with no path to profitability in sight, that's all it is: a lottery ticket with a VERY small amount of AUM allocated.) *It's not possible to create a perfect weighting with options in your portfolio, especially short puts, but I've done the best I can. For example, notionally, I could be tied to even more* ***Upstart*** *than I've represented here. But Upstart would have to be ITM across three separate strikes (70, 80, and 100) by January 2023, which nobody can predict. (What I can say is that anything under $100 is DIRT cheap for Upstart, so I'm more than happy to own it at about $51, $55, and $66, which would be the breakeven prices at each strike, respectively, when including the outrageous premium I was paid for writing these puts.) I split the notional values of being assigned each put in half to represent the fact that Upstart is currently ITM for my 100 puts, ATM for the 80, and OTM for 70.

Mr. Pelosi made a purchase of between $1 million and $5 million [shares of Nvidia]( a semiconductor company, according to a disclosure filing made by Speaker Pelosi's office. He exercised 200 call options, or 20,000 shares, the disclosure states. The disclosure raised eyebrows, as Reuters reported that the Senate could vote on a bill that contains billions of dollars in subsidies within the semiconductor industry as early as Tuesday. Curtis Houck, managing editor of right-leaning media watchdog NewsBusters, said it was ""no accident that the liberal media have made the decision to ignore"" the story that could damage Pelosi. ""For those that are aware of it, they have zero comprehension and/or shame to realize how it's a quintessential story of how the elites work for their own financial benefit, not that of the American people,"" Houck told Fox News Digital. Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi's office has attempted to distance the House Speaker from her husband’s recent stock trades. ""The Speaker does not own any stocks. As you can see from the required disclosures, with which the Speaker fully cooperates, these transactions are marked ‘SP’ for Spouse. The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions,"" spokesman Drew Hammill told FOX Business. In 2020, Republican Sen.

CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and NBC all covered the story. ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" even featured a lengthy commentary about it. Charlie Gasparino appeared on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Monday to discuss whether the move could be insider trading. ""This dude is a rising star on Wall Street,"" Gasparino joked before taking a serious tone. ""Obviously this brings up the notion, is this insider trading? Is she giving him some tips? We should point out that the SEC and the DOJ have brought cases on insider tips via pillow talk. Trust me on this. It’s happened,"" he said.

I'm trying to get a handle on when gaming revenues may bottom. Even though, Q2 earnings were anticipated and matched revised estimates, the Q3 revenue guidance of $5.7Bn was way below consensus estimates of $6.7Bn. A few takeaways from the earnings call. They guided to 65% gross margins for Q3 - Given the weakness in ASP's for gamin chips - is it achievable? I was trying to estimate Q3 gaming revenues. From the earnings call Analyst ""I guess, based on the guidance commentary, where I’ve come up thinking about would be like a 30-plus percent sequential decline in gaming"" CFO - ""And we do expect, yes, gaming to decrease, not in the dollar amount that it decreased between Q1 and Q2.Our Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2."" Based on management's revenue estimate of $5.7Bn and the commentary above, I'm getting these estimates for Q3. All Numbers in Millions. Data Center - $3,871 - sequential growth of 3% Auto -$221 - sequential growth of 5% Viz - $500, the same as Q2 OEM - $130, the same as Q2 **GAMING - If $5,700 is the total then that leaves only - $1,000 for gaming, which is a sequential drop of 50%.** Does that make sense? **Alternatively, a sequential drop of 30% would put gaming at $1,428, then the revenue total goes to $6,100** Sandbagging? Difficult to tell. The markets are fairly sanguine about $NVDA's prospects , the stock is up 2% to $177 after falling to $164 in extended trading, I didn't see downward revisions.

Better than expected labor market data, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and optimism about a potentially dovish Federal Reserve have helped boost the beaten down sector. But Gene Munster, a veteran tech analyst and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, warned Monday that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could pop tech investors’ bubble this week. Fed Chair Powell will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday in his first public outing since a Feb. 7 interview with the private equity billionaire David Rubenstein that was largely interpreted as dovish by markets. He’s expected to discuss February’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes, where most Fed officials said they anticipated “ongoing” rate hikes and some even argued that recent labor market strength warrants a “tighter stance of monetary policy.” Munster argued that Powell realized after his comments last month that if he is not “overly hawkish”—repeatedly doubling down on his inflation-fighting stance—every time he speaks, then markets interpret it as a sign that he will pause interest rate hikes or even pivot to cuts. As a result, the tech analyst said that he expects to see Powell “retreat to his fallback position of a more hawkish tone” during the hearing. And a hawkish Fed is never good for tech stocks, which rely on low rates to invest in their growth and are often valued using the Fed’s benchmark interest rate.",5.448585231193927

Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter. Automotive revenue, Tesla’s core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter. Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO. The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures. Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates. Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin. Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management’s consideration were seeking updates on the company’s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company’s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla. In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles. A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai. According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years. Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023. Source:",5.810110028860028
549,2023-04-26 04:20:59,picsit,Britain blocks Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard,"LONDON — Britain’s top competition regulator on Wednesday moved to block[ Microsoft]( acquisition of video game publisher [Activision Blizzard]( The measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition. Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market. Microsoft could make Activision’s games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform, Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the space, the CMA said. Cloud gaming is a technology that enables gamers to access games via companies’ remote servers — effectively streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a mainstream way of playing games. Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $69 billion, in [one of the biggest deals the video game industry has seen]( to date. Executives at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content offerings. However, some of Microsoft’s competitors contested the deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft [may shut off distribution access to Activision’s popular Call of Duty franchise]( for certain platforms. [Sony]( in particular, has voiced concern with Microsoft’s Activision purchase. The Japanese gaming giant fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty exclusive to its Xbox consoles in the long run. Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo]( [Nvidia]( and other firms [10-year agreements]( to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms. Microsoft argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms. Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same features. Sony still opposes the deal. The CMA had raised concerns with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release. Cloud gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic in 2022. Even with the CMA’s blessing, Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal. The EU [continues to probe the merger]( to assess whether it hurts competition, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission [sued to block the deal]( on antitrust grounds.

553,2023-05-18 21:07:33,ST530,Is there potential to short NVDA?,"I was taking a look at the general semiconductor industry and was surprised by the metrics of NVDA. The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. I also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning. I do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows.

The founder of Ark Invest, and noted tech innovation investor, tweeted on Monday that the AI darling is now overpriced. Nvidia shares have risen more than 30% since the company reported earnings on May 24, and the stock touched a $1 trillion dollar market cap on Tuesday. Wood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches. It hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading session. With the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) now up more than 2.5% in the last five days, Wood argues there are going to be other winners in the AI space outside of Nvidia. ""Other companies with visionary leaders, strong global distribution and, perhaps most important, large-high-quality pools of proprietary data should be big #AI winners, with revenues and earnings surprising significantly on the high side of expectations during the years ahead,"" Wood tweeted. There will be ""dozens"" of AI winners, according to Wood. But the one that stands out to Ark, as it often does, is Tesla (TSLA). Wood argues that at six times revenue, Tesla stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's current 25 times revenue valuation. ""(Tesla) is the most obvious beneficiary of the recent breakthroughs in #AI, as it aims for an $8-10 trillion revenue TAM in autonomous mobility by 2030,"" Wood wrote. With several positive headlines in the news of late including a growing relationship in China, Tesla shares are up more than 7% amid the broader tech rally. Wood's Nvidia comments come as her flagship ETF, the Ark Innovation Fund (ARKK), has struggled to return to its pandemic dominance. The ETF skyrocketed during the risk-on bull market of 2020 with high-flying pandemic darlings like Tesla, Zoom (ZM), and even Nvidia contributing to gains. But as the Federal Reserve enacted its most aggressive interest rate hike campaign in four decades, risky bets became less popular with investors. Some of Ark's top holdings, such as Zoom, Roku (ROKU), and Coinbase (COIN) are well off their pandemic highs. The fund itself lost more than $1 billion in market cap in 2022 with shares falling nearly 67%.",18.939763488543974

A longtime board member at Nvidia Corp. dumped more than $48 million worth of the chip maker’s shares earlier this week, cashing in on the stock’s recent surge. Harvey Jones, who has been on the Nvidia NVDA, -0.80% board since 1993, sold nearly 120,000 shares of the company Tuesday at prices between $400 and $408.51, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made public Wednesday.

567,2023-06-19 06:46:19,Auautheawesome,"Berlin, Intel strike deal on $33 billion chip plant after months of subsidy talks","BERLIN/STOCKHOLM, June 19 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O) will invest more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in Germany as part of its expansion push in Europe, the U.S. company said on Monday, a project key to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ambitions to create a global chip hub. The deal, which involves two leading-edge semiconductor facilities, involves 10 billion euros in German subsidies, a person familiar with the matter said. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said he was grateful to the German government and the local state of Saxony-Anhalt, where the company plans to built one plant, for ""fulfilling the vision of a vibrant, sustainable, leading-edge semiconductor industry in Germany and the EU"". Under Gelsinger, Intel (INTC.O) has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chipmaking and better compete with rivals AMD (AMD.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Samsung (005930.KS). The deal in Germany would be Intel's third big investment in four days, following a $4.6 billion chip plant in Poland and a $25 billion factory in Israel. Both the United States and Europe are trying to lure big industrial players via a mix of state subsidies and favourable legislation, with Berlin concerned about losing appeal as a place to invest. The German government is investing billions of euros in subsidies to lure tech companies to Germany amidst growing alarm over supply chain fragility and dependence on South Korea and Taiwan for chips. Berlin is currently also talking with Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) and Sweden's electric vehicle battery maker Northvolt about setting up production in Germany, having already convinced Tesla (TSLA.O) to build its first European gigafactory there. Frankfurt-listed Intel shares were 0.3% lower at 1316 GMT. The chipmaker last year announced plans to build a big chip complex in Germany, along with facilities in Ireland and France, as it seeks to benefit from the European Commission's eased funding rules and subsidies as the EU tries to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply. It has not yet specified the exact size of the investment. Gelsinger told Reuters on Friday that the gap between what Germany had offered and what Intel needed was too big but he expected to reach an agreement, adding that his request was to be cost competitive. ""We lost this industry to Asia, we have to be competitive if we're going to bring it back,"" he said, adding the overall investment for the site would be ""tens of billions of dollars"".

Investors question whether the stock can live up to the hype. The dot-com bubble taught investors to be wary of stock-market rallies powered by a technological boom—that is, until generative artificial intelligence sent tech stocks soaring this year. Shares of Nvidia NVDA -0.39%, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the frenzy, have nearly tripled in 2023, while the Nasdaq-100 has climbed 38% and the S&P 500 has gained 16%. For some investors, the surge in Nvidia—now the fifth-largest U.S. company by market value—is difficult to chalk up to anything but speculative mania. Its weighting in the benchmark stock indexes means everyday investors are at the whims of its trajectory, whether they believe in AI’s potential or not. “There’s a huge boom in AI—some people are scrambling to get exposure at any cost, while others are sounding the alarm that this will end in tears,” said Kai Wu, founder and chief investment officer of Sparkline Capital. “Investors can benefit from innovation-led growth, but must be wary of overpaying for it.” Nvidia is the primary producer of semiconductors backing artificial-intelligence systems. The company forecast a record $11 billion in sales for the recently ended quarter when it reported results in May, catching analysts off guard with the projected surge in customer demand. “That’s when the excitement around AI really ramped up,” said Ryan McCormack, an Invesco senior exchange-traded fund strategist. The hype has driven companies such as Meta Platforms and Amazon.com that have been building out AI capabilities, he said. Shares of the tech giants are up 154% and 65% in 2023, respectively. Microsoft, which has climbed 35%, has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a chatbot that can answer difficult questions in seconds. The furious rally in those stocks, long the market’s biggest drivers, has fanned worries about market concentration. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&P 500 now comprise more than a third of the market, according to Dow Jones Market Data. They represented 27% of the index at the start of the year and less than a quarter in 2000. “The market story that rhymes most with the internet bubble is the concentration of leadership,” said Mike Edwards, deputy chief investment officer of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers. Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings report, due Aug. 23, will provide insight into whether its inexorable rise is well-rooted in demand for chips, or a product of hype. The stock gained 24% in the trading session after its earnings reported in May, and 14% the day following February’s results. Investors are paying up for the shares, betting on a windfall down the line. Nvidia is trading at 41 times its sales from the last 12 months, according to FactSet, compared with 2.4 times sales for the S&P 500. On a forward basis, the stock trades at 20 times its expected sales for the year ahead—double its average over the last decade of 10 times, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The nascency of AI programs such as ChatGPT means it is likely too early to determine whether Nvidia can raise revenue in line with the eye-watering valuation investors have slapped on its shares. If the company’s growth isn’t enough to reflect its price, the stock could crater. A basket of 43 high-multiple internet stocks—those worth at least $5 billion that traded at 25 times their revenue at the turn of the century—crashed 80% over the next two years, according to Sparkline. The companies weren’t duds, either. Their sales grew 10-fold in the ensuing two decades. But investors were badly bruised from the bust: The shares returned an average of 16% in that time span. The S&P 500 returned 284%. The basket included Amazon and Microsoft, both darlings of today’s market, along with Cisco Systems, then one of the largest companies in the Nasdaq-100. The networking- equipment maker traded as high as 38 times its sales in early 2000. Cisco has returned 43% since the start of the century—it is down 0.4% when excluding dividends. “Valuations matter,” said Wu. “Investing in stocks exposed to rapidly growing technologies only works if the growth is not already priced in. Unfortunately, in periods of euphoria, the market has a tendency not only to price in potential growth, but to greatly overextrapolate it.” One reason why this rally might lack the boom-and-bust nature of the dot-com bubble: The beneficiaries of artificial intelligence were the stocks already shining this year. Investors were flocking to big tech in the first quarter, seeking shelter in strong balance sheets and cash flows. Tech companies are also benefiting from the expected end of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate campaign and resilient consumer spending. Cyclical sectors of the broader market have begun to catch up now that recession fears are fading. “It’s not like 1999 when investors were racing to hot IPOs for companies that had no chance of making money,” said Edwards. “Today’s winners are disciplined, enormous companies that have moats in place and data sets to exploit.”",-1.364303411473222

The drop was caused by two major factors: **1.** Tesla's battery supplier, Panasonic, cut vehicle battery output in Japan during the third quarter, decreasing its annual profit prediction by 15%. This was attributable to a worldwide slowdown in EV sales. Panasonic provides battery cells to Tesla's Nevada Gigafactory in the United States. However, the Japanese manufacturing drop had an impact on customers worldwide, not only in North America. **2.** ON Semiconductor revealed lower-than-expected profit and revenue guidance due to decreasing sales. ON Semiconductor manufactures silicon carbide chips used by Tesla in its EV powertrain and other important components. A decline in demand for these chips is viewed as a possible indicator of slowing EV sales, notably for Tesla. Tesla investor Gary Black said that the stock's downturn could be attributed to ON Semiconductor's -18% projection failure. This was owing to concerns about the increasing danger to vehicle demand caused by rising interest rates. Tesla shares have dropped roughly 22% in the last month, but are still **up 60% year to date.**",-1.1388888888888886

They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets. Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least. Now I know this is a ""stocks"" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&P 500 ETF. So I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META & TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE. Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world?

Here’s how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December: Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue. Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year. With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue. Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street. Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia’s recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs. Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips. Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022. Intel’s largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%. Intel’s second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs. Intel foundry services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase.",3.2251082251082246

Net income, at $21.87 billion, or $2.93 per share, increased from $16.43 billion, or $2.20 per share. The company’s Intelligent Cloud segment produced $25.88 billion in revenue, up 20% and above the $25.29 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The grouping contains Azure cloud infrastructure, SQL Server, Windows Server, Nuance, GitHub and enterprise services. Within that segment, revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30%. Analysts polled by CNBC had expected 27.7% growth, and the StreetAccount consensus was 27.5%. The metric for the previous quarter was 29%. Revenue from the Productivity and Business Processes unit including Office productivity software, LinkedIn and Dynamics totaled $19.25 billion. That was up 13% and higher than the $18.99 billion StreetAccount consensus. The More Personal Computing segment contributed $16.89 billion in revenue, up about 19% and more than the StreetAccount consensus of $16.79 billion. The segment comprises Windows, Surface, Bing and Xbox. During the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft closed its acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, its largest deal ever. The company also announced custom cloud chips and started selling a $30 monthly Copilot artificial intelligence add-on to Microsoft 365 productivity software bundles. But layoffs continued. Microsoft’s LinkedIn subsidiary cut around 700 jobs in October on top of the 10,000 announced earlier in the year. Last week, Microsoft said it’s eliminating around 1,900 employees in its gaming unit, or about 9% of headcount, following the Activision deal. Source:",4.087301587301587
592,2024-01-31 17:45:47,mickdewgul,Two Big Differences Between AMD & NVDA,"I was digging deep into a lot of tech stocks on my watch lists and came across what I think are two big differences that separate AMD and NVDA from a margins perspective and a management approach. Obviously, at the moment NVDA has superior technology and the current story for AMD's expected rise (an inevitable rise in the eyes of most) is that they'll steal future market share from NVDA. That they'll close the gap and capture billions of dollars worth of market share. Well, that might eventually happen, but I couldn't ignore these two differences during my research. The first is margins. NVDA is rocking an astounding 42% profit margin and 57% operating margin. AMD on the other hand is looking at an abysmal .9% profit margin and 4% operating margins. Furthermore, when it comes to management, NVDA is sitting at 27% of a return on assets and 69% return on equity while AMD posts .08% return on assets and .08% return in equity. Thats an insane gap in my eyes. Speaking to management there was another insane difference. AMD's president rakes home 6 million a year while the next highest paid person is making just 2 million. NVDA's CEO is making 1.6 million and the second highest paid employee makes 990k. That to me looks like greedy president on the AMD side versus a company that values it's second tier employees in NVDA. I've been riding the NVDA wave for nearly a decade now and have been looking at opening a defensive position in AMD, but those margins and the CEO salary disparity I found to be alarming at the moment. Maybe if they can increase their margins it'll be a buy for me, but waiting for a pull back until then and possibly a more company friendly President.",4.3478260869565215

My question is: If the majority of growth in an index that is supposed to represent the broader performance of the market is localized to the tech sector, is it still a safe(r) more reliable investment than individual stock picks in the tech sector? Will we see a market correction eventually as small and midsized cap companies aren't performing nearly as well as they are being portrayed? I just see everyone talking about hitting 5k for the first time but I'm like can we really consider this still an effective tool at measuring the broader performance of the market if 6/7 companies account for a min of 25% of total cap. I mean shouldn't we be normalizing the growth to reflect this? I thought the whole point was to measure the performance/health of 500 companies not 30 or less like the dow. I guess the crux of my question is can we really say that investing in index funds like VOO or VTI is safe(r) or as safe of a bet as it used to be 20/30 years ago? What happens if one of the mag 6/7 goes down? We can't expect the US to continue trade tariff policies and funding/engaging in armed conflicts just to keep a company above foreign competition. Edited to add: some of the comments have acknowledged the near-term risk, which is what I was getting at. I apologize for my question being poorly worded. I know that long term it is safe, but near term (next 1-3 years), am I making a better decision going with individual large cap tech stocks, and then once small and midsized caps start growing again selling and then re-investing in index funds, or spreading out my risk in an index funds now. I know this is all based on personal risk tolerance but I'm just looking to see how others are feeling *ATM= at the moment* Second edit: I was corrected in that the SP500 is solely large cap. And that what I am really talking about is mega cap vs large cap. If I knew how to cross out text on mobile, I would correct it. But still my question remains, how can we include the performance statistics of stocks that are so far removed from the rest of the companies in the SP500? Are we putting too much emphasis on the growth of less than 10 companies when we are talking about the overall ""health of the economy"" ?(SP400 and SP600 are mid and small caps, respectively) Third edit: I was reminded that I should state my retirement timeline. At the earliest I'm saying 30 years conservatively (maybe 25 if im really lucky with investments and/or never have children) and 40 at the latest. I would also like to thank everyone for their advice on this as I have realized that I am letting past negative events cloud my judgement too much and that I am probably being impatient and I should just make continual investments in the market every month. And with looking at 20/30yr trends the market has always gone up so even if I had the absolute worst timing if I just keep investing in solid companies/funds by the time I reach retirement I will be set.",8.038826641767821

It’s the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker’s stock soaring. Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google’s $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value. The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products. Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market. Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques — such as transformer architecture — used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT. Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a “code red” situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.

I didn't have enough money to buy the dip in 2020 because all of my money was tied up in stuff like $WBA, $SPG, and $SJM. Lol. Only these past two years, I started to shift strategies and buy good businesses with actual prospects. That's why I'm down only -5% rather than -35%. I'm just ranting. I can't believe I wasted so much time researching ""undervalued"" companies and couldn't even beat cash interest. I'm only 29 at least, so hopefully I can still grow my portfolio. But I missed out on some of the best years of the S&P... Oh yeah, I'm holding some NVDA and yesterday my dad was screaming at me to sell, and how it's too high, and ""it can't go up forever."" I was really annoyed, so I created the image above and sent it to him. Oh, he also lost hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past 30 years. I grew up watching my parents fight over money all the time. Don't know why I ever listened to him. I did make plenty of my own mistakes, of course. And it's ultimately my fault for following his advice. I think I've learned a lot so I don't feel as much of a need to rely on other people anymore. I guess I'm just really annoyed that he's still saying the same thing as he did back then. OK, thanks for listening to my venting.",6.740143369175626

This follows Microsoft at 3.19T and Apple at 2.91T. If Nvidia were to become #1 in market cap, which looks like that's going to happen soon, that would be about 22% increase in its stock price. But beyond that, how realistic is it for this company to keep growing up to 4T market cap and beyond? Are the prospects seriously that good? To hit 4T, Nvidia stock would need to rise by another 50%. I just can't see how that is going to happen. How can Nvidia, which really is just a company that makes GPUs and drives, end up being more valuable than Microsoft, Apple, and Google in the long term? Nvidia has a fantastic business model and ridiculous profit margins, but it still seems unrealistic to me for it's share price to keep growing and growing to a record high market cap at this point. My gut feels like there is far too much hype surrounding Nvidia's prospects and price should drop a fair bit.

620,2024-06-09 08:11:21,Think_Ad8198,Bear Case: Why I believe Alphabet will do everything right and still lose,"Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors, but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue. With the ""Attention is all you need"" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch. But even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift. Much of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo. Ultimately, Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive, but without a massive moat in a crucial industry, it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META, MSFT, and NVDA.",7.220238095238093

627,2024-06-17 10:15:52,StatQuants,"Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund","KEY POINTS * Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research. * The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date. * The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. [Nvidia]( blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple]( The index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)]( follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday’s close. The new calculations show [Microsoft]( as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research. All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be. As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said. That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia’s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%. The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index. The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances. The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market. “Understanding how they might be weighted, where they’re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what’s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,” Bartolini said. The fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week. The free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said. “Its free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,” Bartolini said. The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date. On Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.

The move would be Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations. Regardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google’s web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said. The Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta’s Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government’s proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request. Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses. A Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment. The US plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s. Justice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google’s practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company’s search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google’s AI products in order to appear in search results. **Breakup** Divesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that’s been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store. Those agreements also require that Google’s search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can’t be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found. Mehta’s decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn’t yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn’t be allowed “to reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.” Google paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc. Mehta’s ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google’s total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year’s trial. If the Justice Department doesn’t call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said. **Data Access** Another option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft’s Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta’s ruling found that Google’s contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data – 16 times as much as its next closest competitor — but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively. Europe’s recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds. Requiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department’s first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents. In the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other. **AI Products** For years, websites have allowed Google’s web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company’s search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI. Last fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn’t apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with “AI Overviews,” narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web. Google doesn’t allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a “feature” of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews. While AI Overviews only appear on a fraction of searches, the feature’s roll-out has been rocky after some excerpts offered embarrassing suggestions, like advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza.",7.968631897203327

646,2024-09-14 07:58:14,foo-bar-nlogn-100,NVDA Bear Case | AI Bubble Collapse | Falsifying the Scalability Hypothesis | Thematics,"# Background The AI scaling hypothesis is a key concept in artificial intelligence research that suggests improvements in AI capabilities can be achieved primarily by increasing the size and computational resources of AI models. We can understand several aspects of this hypothesis: Key Points of the AI Scaling Hypothesis 1. **Emergence of Capabilities**: As AI models grow larger and are trained on more data, they tend to develop new capabilities that were not explicitly programmed. This emergence of novel abilities is a central tenet of the scaling hypothesis. 2. **Generalization**: Larger models demonstrate improved ability to generalize across different tasks and domains, often showing surprising competence in areas they were not specifically trained for. 3. **Efficiency in Learning**: Scaled-up models can learn more efficiently from limited data, sometimes matching or surpassing the performance of smaller, task-specific models with just a few examples. 4. **Continuous Improvement**: The hypothesis suggests that continuing to scale up models will lead to further improvements in AI performance and capabilities, potentially approaching or even surpassing human-level abilities in various domains. # Hyperscalers and First Mover Advantage The scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind many recent advancements in AI, including large language models and multimodal AI systems. However, it's important to note that while scaling has proven effective, it also comes with challenges such as increased computational requirements and potential biases in large datasets. Hyperscalers are racing to scale their AI capabilities and be ***the first to discover emergent properties for several compelling reasons at any cost. This is the main driver in the billions of capital expenditures over the last 18 months.*** At the forefront is the significant competitive advantage that comes with pioneering new AI capabilities in the fast-evolving tech landscape. Being first allows these companies to establish market dominance, attract and retain customers seeking cutting-edge AI solutions, and gain valuable insights from early deployments. This advantage is not merely about prestige; it translates directly into substantial economic benefits. The economic incentives driving this race are staggering. Industry projections suggest that AI technology in data centers alone could drive spending of up to $2 trillion over the next five years. Additionally, the AI silicon market is expected to reach $400 billion by 2027. These figures underscore the massive financial opportunity that awaits those who lead in AI capabilities. Hyperscalers are positioning themselves to capitalize on the growing demand for custom AI silicon and infrastructure, potentially securing a significant share of this burgeoning market. The rush to scale is also fueled by the promise of technological breakthroughs. ***The AI scaling hypothesis suggests that continued increases in model size and computational resources will lead to the emergence of novel capabilities not explicitly programmed, improved generalization across different tasks and domains, and more efficient learning from limited data***\*.\* This potential for transformative advancements keeps hyperscalers intensely focused on pushing the boundaries of AI scale. Hyperscalers are uniquely positioned in this race due to their existing infrastructure advantages. They possess the necessary computational resources, data centers, and cloud infrastructure that can be leveraged for AI training and deployment. This allows them to offer scalable AI services to a wide range of customers, from individuals to large enterprises, further cementing their market position. Strategically, leading in AI capabilities allows hyperscalers to shape the future direction of AI development and applications, influence industry standards, and attract top AI talent and research partnerships. The potential for breakthrough discoveries, including the possibility of approaching or surpassing human-level abilities in various domains or even developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), adds another layer of motivation to their efforts. # Falsifying the Scalability Hypothesis The AI scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind many recent advancements in artificial intelligence, but there are compelling arguments for how it could potentially be falsified One primary method would be ***to demonstrate diminishing returns as models are scaled up in size and computational resources.*** ***If performance gains plateau or even decline rather than continuing to improve linearly or superlinearly, it would suggest fundamental limits to scaling***. This could be coupled with identifying qualitative gaps – cognitive abilities or tasks that larger models consistently fail at, even as they improve on other benchmarks. Such findings would indicate that some fundamental capabilities are missing and cannot be addressed by pure scaling alone. # Simple Bench Simple bench is the only reasoning benchmark written in natural language at which English-speaking humans (and yes, even 'smart highschoolers') can score 90%+, while frontier LLMs get less than 50%. It is an encapsulation of the reasoning deficit found in AI like ChatGPT. What the benchmark does is take a standard kind of logic puzzle that people ask LLM's, then spikes it with a ""surprise twist"" that requires what we would think of as common sense. Thus an AI has more difficulty in predicting the next tokens because of the twist. But humans can still reason out an answer. These questions are fully private, preventing contamination, and have been vetted by PhDs from multiple domains, as well as the author - Philip, from AI Explained - who first exposed the numerous errors in the MMLU (Aug 2023). \[ |Model|Estimated Parameter Size| |:-|:-| |GPT-4|1 - 1.7 trillion| |GPT4-Turbo|Not publicly disclosed| |GPT-4o|Not publicly disclosed| |Claude|Not publicly disclosed| ||| ***These large AI companies don’t disclose training parameter sizes because we can graph training size vs benchmark score to falsify the scalability hypothesis.*** The AI scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind significant advancements in artificial intelligence, propelling the development of increasingly powerful models and fueling a race among hyperscalers to achieve breakthrough capabilities. This hypothesis has led to remarkable improvements in AI performance across various domains, from natural language processing to computer vision and beyond. However, as we delve deeper into the realm of large-scale AI models, we are beginning to encounter signs that suggest the scaling hypothesis may have limitations. The emergence of benchmarks like Simple Bench, which reveal persistent reasoning deficits in even the most advanced language models, indicates that simply increasing model size and computational resources may not be sufficient to achieve human-level reasoning capabilities. The reluctance of major AI companies to disclose training parameter sizes for their latest models adds another layer of intrigue to this discussion. ***This lack of transparency makes it challenging for the broader scientific community to accurately assess the relationship between model scale and performance, potentially hindering efforts to validate or falsify the scaling hypothesis.*** Moreover, the increasing costs associated with training and deploying ever-larger models, coupled with concerns about data scarcity and computational limitations, raise questions about the long-term sustainability of the scaling approach. As we approach these practical and theoretical limits, it becomes clear that the future of AI advancement may require more than just scaling up existing architectures. Looking ahead, the field of AI research may need to pivot towards more innovative approaches that focus on qualitative improvements in model architecture, training methodologies, and data utilization. The development of more sophisticated benchmarks, like Simple Bench, that can effectively measure complex reasoning abilities will be crucial in guiding these efforts. Ultimately, while the scaling hypothesis has undoubtedly driven remarkable progress in AI, its limitations are becoming increasingly apparent. The next frontier in AI research may lie not in building ever-larger models, but in developing more efficient, adaptable, and truly intelligent systems that can match or exceed human-level reasoning across a wide range of tasks. This shift could lead to a new paradigm in AI development, one that combines the insights gained from scaling with novel approaches to create more capable and robust artificial intelligence. # AI Bubble Collapse and Trillions in Misallocated Capital The AI scaling hypothesis has been the cornerstone of recent advancements in artificial intelligence, driving unprecedented investments and fueling a race among tech giants to build ever-larger models. However, as we stand on the precipice of a potential paradigm shift, the falsification of this hypothesis could trigger a seismic disruption in the AI industry, potentially leading to the collapse of what many now recognize as an AI bubble. The signs of this impending crisis are becoming increasingly apparent. Benchmarks like Simple Bench are exposing critical reasoning deficits in even the most advanced language models, defying the expectation that larger models inherently lead to more intelligent systems. The reluctance of major AI companies to disclose training parameter sizes for their latest models further fuels suspicion that the relationship between scale and performance may not be as straightforward as once believed. As the evidence mounts against the scaling hypothesis, we must confront the sobering reality of the potential misallocation of trillions of dollars in capital. Hyperscalers and investors have poured vast resources into the development of massive data centers, custom AI chips, and enormous models, all predicated on the belief that bigger is inherently better. If this foundational assumption proves false, the repercussions will be far-reaching and profound. The collapse of the AI bubble, triggered by the falsification of the scaling hypothesis, could lead to: 1. A dramatic reassessment of the valuations of AI-focused companies, potentially wiping out billions in market capitalization. 2. A crisis of confidence in the AI industry, leading to a sharp decline in investment and a potential ""AI winter."" **This potential collapse serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of putting too much faith in a single hypothesis**, no matter how compelling it may seem. It underscores the critical importance of diverse approaches in AI research and the need for rigorous, independent verification of claims made by industry leaders. # TLDR; how many r in strawberry # ChatGPT said: There are two ""r""s in the word ""strawberry."" # You said: count again # ChatGPT said: I apologize for the mistake.

647,2024-09-20 08:12:40,foo-bar-nlogn-100,NVDA Bear Case | AI Bubble Collapse | Financial Round Tripping | Thematics,"# Background It's crucial to understand the concept of financial round-tripping and its implications for the market. Round-tripping is a deceptive practice that has gained notoriety in recent years due to its potential to mislead investors and manipulate financial statements. This fraudulent technique involves creating artificial transactions between two or more entities to inflate revenues, evade taxes, or present a false picture of financial health. Typically, round-tripping occurs when a company sells an asset to another entity while simultaneously agreeing to buy back the same or a similar asset at approximately the same price. This creates the illusion of bustling business activity and growth, which can be particularly attractive to speculative investors. However, these transactions lack genuine economic substance and violate the fundamental accounting principle of substance over form. Round-tripping has been implicated in several high-profile financial scandals, including those involving energy traders like Enron and CMS Energy, as well as financial service providers such as Wirecard. As an investment advisor, it's essential to be vigilant and look for red flags that might indicate round-tripping, such as unusually high revenue growth without corresponding increases in cash flow or profit margins. **The practice of major tech companies providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting growth in datacenter and AI usage can indeed be viewed as a form of financial round-tripping**. This strategy raises significant concerns about the authenticity of reported revenue growth, as it creates a cycle where investments return as revenue, inflating metrics without genuine market expansion. # History of Financial Round Tripping in Tech Over the past 20 years, several high-profile cases of round-tripping have emerged in the technology sector, highlighting the prevalence of this deceptive practice. Here are some notable examples: # Enron Scandal (2001) While not strictly a tech company, Enron's collapse involved significant round-tripping in energy trading. The company engaged in numerous sham transactions with special purpose entities to inflate revenues and hide debt. These transactions involved selling assets to these entities and then buying them back at similar prices, creating the illusion of bustling business activity. # Global Crossing (2002) This telecommunications company was accused of swapping network capacity with other carriers to artificially boost revenue. Global Crossing would sell capacity on its network to another carrier while simultaneously buying an equal amount of capacity from that carrier, with no money changing hands. This practice inflated reported revenues without generating actual cash flow. # Qwest Communications (2002-2004) The telecom giant was found to have engaged in round-trip transactions involving the swapping of fiber-optic capacity with other companies. These deals were structured to appear as legitimate sales and purchases, but in reality, they were designed to inflate revenues artificially. # Computer Associates (2004) The software company was involved in a $2.2 billion accounting fraud that included round-tripping. They used a practice called the ""35-day month,"" where they kept their books open for an extra few days to record additional revenue from the next quarter, creating a perpetual cycle of inflated earnings. # Nortel Networks (2007) The Canadian telecommunications equipment manufacturer was found to have engaged in various accounting irregularities, including round-tripping. They manipulated revenue recognition by recording sales to distributors as final sales, even when the products were likely to be returned. # Wirecard (2020) While not exclusively a tech company, Wirecard was a major player in digital payment processing. The company was found to have engaged in massive fraud, including round-tripping transactions. They created fake customer accounts and used a network of partner companies to simulate legitimate business activities, inflating their reported revenues and cash balances. These examples demonstrate that round-tripping has been a persistent issue in the tech sector, often used to artificially inflate revenues, manipulate stock prices, and deceive investors. The complex nature of technology businesses and their often intangible assets can make it easier to engage in such deceptive practices. However, increased regulatory scrutiny and improved auditing practices have made it more challenging for companies to engage in round-tripping without detection. # AI Labs Round Tripping The practice of major tech companies providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting growth in datacenter and AI usage can indeed be viewed as a form of financial round-tripping. This strategy raises significant concerns about the authenticity of reported revenue growth, as it creates a cycle where investments return as revenue, inflating metrics without genuine market expansion. # Artificial Inflation of Revenue When tech giants invest in AI startups or provide them with datacenter credits, they essentially create a loop where their initial financial outlay returns to them as revenue. This cycle artificially inflates their cloud and AI service usage metrics, presenting an illusion of robust growth. For example, companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) have invested billions in AI firms like Anthropic, which then become major consumers of AWS's cloud services. This arrangement leads to an inflated perception of demand for these services, despite the fact that the growth is internally generated rather than stemming from new market participants. # Lack of Economic Substance These transactions often lack real economic substance because the AI labs are primarily spending money provided by the tech companies themselves. This means that instead of attracting new, independent customers or generating fresh revenue streams, the tech companies are simply cycling their own funds back into their revenue reports. Such practices can mislead stakeholders into believing that there is a substantial increase in market demand when, in reality, the growth is not driven by external factors. # Misleading Market Perception # Inflated Growth Figures By reporting increased usage of their cloud and AI services due to these internal transactions, tech companies create a misleading picture of sector growth. This self-generated growth does not reflect broader market demand but rather a strategic manipulation to enhance financial statements. As highlighted by industry analysts, this practice can give an impression of thriving business activity that may not exist. # Skewed Competition Metrics This practice also distorts the competitive landscape by making it appear that certain companies are outperforming others in attracting AI business. In reality, these companies are subsidizing usage through investments and credits, which can skew competition metrics and obscure true market dynamics. # Financial Interdependence The symbiotic relationship created between tech giants and AI labs through these arrangements can lead to reduced innovation. AI labs may become overly reliant on specific cloud providers for resources, limiting their ability to explore diverse technological solutions. Additionally, this interdependence can result in conflicts of interest in the development and deployment of AI technologies, as the success of the startups becomes closely tied to the continued support from their benefactor companies. # Regulatory and Accounting Concerns # Revenue Recognition Issues Questions arise regarding how these transactions should be accounted for. If a company invests in an AI startup and subsequently recognizes revenue from that startup's usage of its services, it creates a complex accounting situation that may not accurately reflect the company's true financial position. This ambiguity opens up potential for manipulation, as companies could use these arrangements to meet growth targets or analyst expectations. # Potential for Manipulation The practice opens the door for potential manipulation of financial statements. Companies might engage in these arrangements to artificially boost reported revenues, thereby meeting or exceeding market expectations without actual underlying business growth. # Market Distortion This practice can lead to a distorted view of the AI and cloud computing markets. By overestimating market size and growth rates based on inflated projections from round-tripping deals, resources may be misallocated. This could potentially create an AI bubble driven by circular investments rather than genuine demand. # Conclusion In conclusion, while providing resources to AI labs can drive innovation, the current practice of offering datacenter credits and reporting resulting usage as growth shares similarities with financial round-tripping. It raises significant concerns about transparency, authenticity in corporate reporting, and potential distortions in market perceptions within the AI and cloud computing sectors. # TLDR; The practice of tech giants providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting the resulting usage as growth is essentially a modern form of financial round-tripping. This deceptive cycle artificially inflates revenue and usage metrics, creating a false perception of market demand. It distorts the competitive landscape, potentially stifles innovation, and raises serious regulatory concerns. Most alarmingly, it could be fueling an AI bubble based on circular investments rather than genuine market growth. Investors and regulators should be wary of this practice, as it may be masking the true state of the AI and cloud computing markets, potentially leading to misallocation of resources and inflated valuations in the tech sector.",0.9573708734014079

TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales. If TSMC reports strong earnings, it could indicate robust demand for semiconductors, which is crucial since NVIDIA relies heavily on TSMC for manufacturing its GPUs. Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA. Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may *revise* their ratings or ***price targets*** for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a **spike** in NVDA’s stock price. Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors. Reports indicate that TSMC is now able to ship more chips than ever before. Do you believe TSMC’s earnings will positively impact NVIDIA? Are you planning to make any moves based on this news?

The Company has begun the process of identifying a successor independent registered public accounting firm. The Company will authorize EY to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor independent registered public accounting firm, once selected. The Company does not currently expect that resolution of any of the matters raised by EY, or under consideration by the Special Committee, as noted below, will result in any restatements of its quarterly reports for the fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, or for prior fiscal years.* *EY was engaged on March 15, 2023 to perform an audit for the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, and has not issued any report on the Company’s financial statements or the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. EY resigned while conducting the audit for the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, EY’s first audit on the Company’s behalf.* *In late July 2024, EY communicated to the Audit Committee concerns about several matters relating to governance, transparency and completeness of communications to EY, and other matters pertaining to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and that the timely filing of the Company’s annual report was at significant risk. In response, the Board appointed an independent special committee of the Board (the “Special Committee”) to review the matters and certain of the Company’s internal controls and certain governance procedures (the “Review”). The Special Committee engaged Cooley LLP, and forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors, LLC to perform an investigation on behalf of and at the direction of the Special Committee. EY and the Board received updates with preliminary information relating to the Review. As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Review remains ongoing and final findings and recommendations have not yet been communicated to EY or the Board.* *After receiving additional information through the Review process, EY informed the Special Committee that the additional information EY received raised questions, including about whether the Company demonstrates a commitment to integrity and ethical values consistent with Principle 1 of the COSO Framework, about the ability and willingness of the Audit Committee and overall Board to demonstrate and act as an oversight body that is independent of the CEO and other members of management in accordance with Principle 2 of the COSO Framework, and whether EY could rely on representations from certain members of management and from the Audit Committee. In the Resignation Letter, EY stated, in part: “we are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.”* *Although the Company recognizes EY’s decision is final, it disagrees with EY’s decision to resign as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm – the Special Committee has not yet obtained all information relevant for the Review and has not concluded the Review. Nevertheless, the Company has taken the concerns expressed by EY seriously, and will carefully consider the findings of the Special Committee and any remedial or other actions recommended by the Special Committee following conclusion of the Review.* *Other than as described above, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the subsequent interim period preceding EY’s resignation, (1) there were no “disagreements,” as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, with EY on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which if not resolved to EY’s satisfaction to our knowledge would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter thereof in connection with its report, and (2) there were no “reportable events” as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.* *The Company has provided EY with a copy of the disclosures required by Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K contained in Item 4.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and has requested that EY furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the Company’s statements made in response to those requirements and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree.

660,2024-10-31 17:44:41,Puginator,Amazon CEO pledges AI investments will pay off as capital expenditures surge 81%,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is trying to reassure investors who may be worried about the future payoff of the company’s massive investments in generative artificial intelligence. On a conference call with analysts following the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Thursday, Jassy pointed to the success of Amazon’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, which has become a crucial profit engine despite the extreme costs associated with building data centers. “I think we’ve proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business,” Jassy said. “We expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI.” Amazon spent $22.6 billion on property and equipment during the quarter, up 81% from the year before. Jassy said Amazon plans to spend $75 billion on capex in 2024 and expects an even higher number in 2025. The jump in spending is primarily being driven by generative AI investments, Jassy said. The company is rushing to invest in data centers, networking gear and hardware to meet vast demand for the technology, which has exploded in popularity since OpenAI released its ChatGPT assistant almost two years ago. “It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity,” Jassy said. “And I think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long term that we’re aggressively pursuing it.” AI spending was a big topic on tech earnings calls this week. Meta on Wednesday raised its capital expenditures guidance, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was “quite happy” with the team’s execution. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI weighed on its fiscal first-quarter earnings released on Wednesday, and the company said capital spending would continue to rise. A day earlier, Alphabet CFO Anat Ashkenazi warned the company expects capital spending to grow in 2025. Amazon has said its cloud unit has picked up more business from companies that need infrastructure to deploy generative AI models. It’s also launched several AI products for enterprises, third-party sellers on its marketplace and advertisers in recent months. The company is expected to announce a souped-up version of its Alexa voice assistant that incorporates generative AI, something Jassy said will arrive “in the near future.” Amazon hasn’t disclosed its revenue from generative AI, but Jassy said Thursday it’s become a “multi-billion-dollar revenue run rate” business within AWS that “continues to grow at a triple-digit year-over-year percentage.” “It’s growing more than three times faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew, and we felt like AWS grew pretty quickly,” he added.

Post-January, we're likely to be entering a period of increased tensions with China. This seems bad for Nvidia in multiple ways. 1. Beijing has previously expressed desire to urgently switch away from NVDA chips and invest locally. Obviously that's easier said than done, but with China being such a huge market for NVDA, increased tensions over tariffs could push this mandate further. The amount of revenue NVDA gets from China has already decreased, but this further deceleration could be negative. [ 2. Trump has accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry. He wants to put tariffs on chips from Taiwan. Obviously, everyone is relying on TSMC, so this seems clearly bad news.

AMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. AMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers, including the MI300X, which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. AMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD’s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024. GPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD’s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet. AMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research. Source: [",-2.2427983539094645

684,2024-01-25 19:10:42,rayrayrex,Bullish on NVDA after Intel Guidance,"As many of you know the Intel guidance dropped and it’s had an impact on NVDA and AMD respectively. The issue here is that intels drop in demand is for specifically for “chips used in the traditional server and personal computer markets”. That is to say nothing to do with the AI chips that NVDA and AMD are building on their inventory which the hype is blasting off of. In a separate statement the CEO goes on to say that they expect “$2 billion worth of orders for its AI chips and expects better sales later in the year”. Who gives a damn if their laptop and server business is dying? The future is AI. The drop we’re seeing in aftermarket for both NVDA and AMD is unrelated to what they are producing compared to Intel. With NVDA expecting 20 billion in revenue it’s absurd to correlate the dying performance of one company with the stellar sales of another. Now I understand the market is irrational and there will most likely be a dip on open but it really don’t make any sense to me. The loss in revenue from Intel is correlated with the absurd growth Nvidia has been having. With a 1.1 trillion valuation the computing power and software to boot, I think if anything a decline in intel should be a sign of the absurd market dominance NVDA has.",4.6875

With volume decreasing day over day and price falling, a reversal is likely given the failed push past $700 2. Competition from ARM has actually had a negative impact on NVIDIA’s stock today as investors flocked to alternatives, while ARM continued to rise. The original boost on Thursday was far more likely attributed to Morgan Stanley increasing their price target $750 3. Every Thursday of this year if the stock went sideways/decreased into the end of the day, the stock would drop $15-20 the next day (save for catalysts from other corps - which aren’t coming). Similar pattern can be seen on any chart where NVDA has declined or traded flat the previous day 4. Institutional investors are not going to be buying anymore stock knowing a sharp correction is imminent 2 weeks out. They will be far more inclined to lock profit in and sell as the price dips and corrects before buying back in the 70-80’s. 4.5.

Now he has another great ambition: raising trillions of dollars to reshape the global semiconductor industry. The OpenAI chief executive officer is in talks with investors including the United Arab Emirates government to raise funds for a wildly ambitious tech initiative that would boost the world’s chip-building capacity, expand its ability to power AI, among other things, and cost several trillion dollars, according to people familiar with the matter. The project could require raising as much as $5 trillion to $7 trillion, one of the people said. The fundraising plans, which face significant obstacles, are aimed at solving constraints to OpenAI’s growth, including the scarcity of the pricey AI chips required to train [large language models]( behind AI systems such as ChatGPT. Altman has often complained that there aren’t enough of these kinds of chips—known as graphics processing units, or GPUs—to power OpenAI’s quest for [artificial general intelligence]( which it defines as systems that are broadly smarter than humans.",1.3988095238095233
690,2024-02-09 13:47:18,rayrayrex,NVDA will fall on Monday to 700 because,"1. We are facing resistance at 720 which signals a retracing with the decreasing volume. This has historically always been followed by a fall of 1-3% 2. Anytime the stock has soared 15-20$ it is followed by a sideways movement in the market followed by a drop. Since institutional investors are aware we know this, they will sell off a day early on Monday instead of Tuesday 3. There’s no more catalysts coming up. Today’s boom was brought on by the announcement of their custom chip segment which is now already priced in. They cannot have any more surprises ahead of earnings without risking a boost in price beyond analyst forecasts which causes their price to crater 4. Institutional investors saw my last post listing a decrease in price and bought in droves to drive out what they perceive as the majority of WSB investors. Since the OG meme stock they have been scared of us and actively use the sentiment in our posts to bet against us. It had over 500k impressions meaning it was definitely on their radar 5. Basic game theory: earnings will be nowhere close to the expectations of the guidance given by NVDA, and institutional investors know this. As such the usual approach where buying options 2 weeks ahead of earnings to capitalize on volatility is moot. It’s a race against time to see which big player sells first while they try to maximize their gains. Once one player sells, it will trigger a cascading effect causing the price to drop fast. We could see 690’s 6. I bought calls expiring 2/16 at $690 7. I want to double down on institutional investors being aware of this post.

I know this sub is more about yolo and risking large amounts. I don't take that approach. I look for skews where my risk is minimal and the reward is maximal. NVDA could very well have a blow off top and run to $1k. None of us know. But if you're only risking $100 (to potentially make $5K), then who the hell cares? Minimizing your risk also allows you to take more plays.

AI is the internet plus the ability to reason and analyze anything you give it in fractions of a second. A new unequivocal boomstick to whomever wants to use it. The true winners will be those startups in fields such as robotics, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, space-aeronautics, aviation, protein synthesis, new materials and so, so much more who will use AI in new and exciting ways. Boston dynamics, set to boom. Self-driving robotaxis, set to boom. Flying taxis, set to boom. Job replacement/automation for legacy industry jobs white collar, set to boom. Personal AI agents for your individual workloads, booming. Healthcare change as we know it (doctors won't like this but too bad), set to boom. The amount of industry that is set to shift and mutate and emerge from AI in the next 3 - 5 years will be astonishing. I can tell you, standing on principal, that OpenAI's next release will be so game changing that nobody will deny where AI is heading. There is not a rock you can hide under to be so oblivious as to not see where this is going. The reason why I bring up the next iteration of ChatGPT, GPT5, is because they are initiators of this phenomenon. Other, such as Google (and others) are furiously trying to catch up but as of today the 'MOAT' may be upon us. The reason to believe that one may catch up (or try like hell to) is from the amount of compute power from GPU's it takes to train an ungodly amount of data. Trillions of data points. Billions (soon to be Trillions) of parameters all simulating that of the synaptic neuron connections in which the human brain functions that in turn gives us the spark of life and consciousness. Make no mistake, these guys are living out a present day Manhattan project. These people are trying to build consciousness agency with the all the world's information as a reference document at it's finger tips. Today. And guess what. The only way these guys can build that thing - That AGI/ASI/GAI reality - Is through Nvidia. These guys believe and have tested that if you throw MORE compute at the problem it actually GAINS function. More compute equals more consciousness. That's what these people believe and they're attempting it. Here, let me show you what I mean. What the graph below shows is that over time the amount of data and parameters that are being used to train an AI model. I implore you to watch this video as it is a great easy to understand educational video into what the hell is going on with all of this AI stuff. It's a little technical but very informative and there are varying opinions. I pulled out the very best part in relation to Nvidia here. [AI: Grappling with a New Kind of Intelligence]( It's SO RIDICULOUS that you wouldn't be able to continue to see the beginning so they have to use a log plot chart. And as you see we are heading into Trillions of parameters. For reference GPT-4 was trained on roughly 200 billion parameters. It is estimated GPT-5 will be trained with 2-5 trillion parameters. Sam Altman was dead ass serious when he is inquiring about obtaining $7 trillion for chip development. They believe that with enough compute they can create GOD. So what's the response from Google, Meta and others. Well, they're forming ""AI """"Alliances"""""". Along with that they are going to and buying from the largest AI arms dealer on earth; Nvidia. Nvidia is a common day AI Industrial Complex War machine. **Sovereign AI with AI Foundries** It's not just companies that are looking to compete it's also entire Nation States. Remember, when Italy banned GPT. Well, it turns out, countries don't want the United States building and implementing their AI into other country's culture and way of life. So as of today, you have a battle of not just corporate America but entire countries looking to buy the bullets, tanks and missiles needed for this AI fight. Nvidia sells the absolute best bullets, the best guns, the best ammo one needs to attempt to create their own AI epicenters. And it's so important that it is a national security risk to not just us the United States but to be a nation and not have the capability of AI. Remember the leak about Q\* and a certain encryption being undone. You don't think heads of State where listening to that. Whether it was true or not it is now an imperative that you get with AI or get left behind. That goes just as much for a nation as it does for you as an individual. When asked about the risk of losing out sales to China on Nvidia's last earnings call Jensen Huang clearly stated he was not worried about it because literally nations are coming online to build AI foundries. **Nvidia's Numbers and The Power Of Compounding** The power of compounding and why I think there share price is where it is today and has so much more room to grow. Let me ask you a question but first let me say that AWS's annual revenues are at \~$80/Y Billion. How long do you think with Nvidia's revenues of \~$18/Q Billion to reach or eclipse AWS at a 250% growth rate? 15 years? 10 Years? 5 years? Answer: 1.19 years. Ok let's not be ridiculous perhaps it's 200% instead. 5 years? Nope. 1.35 years. Let's say they have a bad quarter and Italy doesn't pay up. 150% 5 years right? Nope. 1.62 years. Come on they can't keep this up. 100%. has to be 5 years this time. Nope. 2.15 years. 100% growth/2.15 years to 250% growth/1.19 years to reach 80 billion in annual revenues. They're growth last year was 281%. So wait, I wasn't being fair. I used $80 billion for AWS while their revenues last year where $88 Billion and Nvidia's last years 4 quarters where \~$33 Billion. Here are those growth numbers it would take Nvidia to reach $88 billion. At 279% = 0.73 years At 250% = 0.78 years At 200% = 0.89 years at 100% = 1.41 years Folks. That's JUST the data center. They are poised to surpass AWS, Azure and Google Cloud in about .73 to 1.5 years. Yes, you heard that right, your daddy's cloud company is about to be overtaken by your son's gaming GPU company.

That's true that's what it looks like now, and I feel like the underlying facts are going to change soon for its valuation. The price reflected something like a 99% chance of absolutely demolishing earnings and didn't leave a lot of upside for if they even do. * Also, I felt like that was the reverse sort of effect happening - only people buying at that level were shorts capitalizing and it's kind of like how we hit a super-bottom in 2022 from margin calls.

696,2024-02-18 15:41:34,regnadehtmai,To all the NVDA bears… why?,"I’m trying to reasonably understand the bear case for NVDA. Considering pretty much every Wall Street Analyst only makes bull cases for Nvidia, there aren’t any reputable sources I can read for the bear case. The bull case seems clear: the rapidly growing demand for semiconductors with AI/ML-capabilities to use in Data Centers (DC). Pretty much every large tech company is buying up land for DCs, such as in Northern Virginia, and are releasing plans to buy tons of NVDA chips for their new DCs and to upgrade their old DCs. Congress is also choosing NVDA as their favorite chip-maker, forbidding them from selling premier chips to China, presumably to use NVDA for defense-related cyber operations, creating a future for significant government demand. Gen-AI was the catalyst, but machine learning and government cyberops is the demand. Concerning its price, anyone can tell you how NVDA is still cheap relative to other chip-makers by forward p/e. So far, the posts here that warn of an “imminent NVDA crash” are all pseudo-investing… not one discusses flaws in their business strategy. The argument range from “an unrelated tech company had a similar rise 20 years ago, and their stock fell after the Internet bubble burst,” “it rose so quickly, so it must be overvalued,” to “I’ve shorted it, so it just has to fall or else I’m screwed.”",19.699921290830382

I did grow up in the biggest bull market in human history with some Boomers printing money like Chuck E. Cheese bucks.. and everyone is a genius in a bull market.. Well almost everyone. I didn't invest so now I just scam Millennials and Zoomers. Anyway, I like talking stocks with my grandson because it’s something we could connect on, and I have a ton of experience selling worthless advice to idiots. So in 2018 we were talking about the market, and I casually brought up Nvidia. He thought I didn't guide him to that at all. He bought Nvidia in 2017 so he was familiar with it although he bought his shares at 18 yrs old with $2k he had saved up. Nothing insane although he kept 90% to this day. I said I saw NVIDIA in a newspaper article with someone recommending it for elderly’s retirement accounts. So I told my grandson I was an OGangster, called my broker and bought 1,000 shares on the spot because in my words: “I don’t buy a stock if I can’t afford 1,000 shares”. Something only the Zoomers dumb enough to buy meme stocks would fall for. He was dumbstruck because here he thought he was doing great with his savings over the years, and I just humbled his ass with a completely made up sentence. Add in the 4:1 stock split, and now he thinks I'm sitting on 4,000 shares. (I ""confirmed"" it to him when he brought it up in the last month). I haven't sold a dime and don't even know what the price is doing day to day because I don't own any shares. I'm just chilling in my wheelchair and letting him try to get a bigger share of the inheritance. He called and celebrated with me the other day because he transparently wants to get in my will. He thinks I'm already wealthy and dumb enough to drop 6 figures on a stock I know little about. He hopes to inherit my wealth someday, but he’s also a scammy, golddigging SOB and he knows it! Told me “haha you're a genius investor and luck has nothing to do with”. Thought id share here because I’m not sharing this IRL, but I find it pretty ironic my dumb ass grandson is outwiping 95% of this sub. Wendy's boys included.",-3.364583333333334

708,2024-03-06 09:37:49,cbusoh66,"If you missed the NVDA train, buy ARM","Summary: I fully expect Nvidia and Jensen Huang to go after ARM and acquire a (rather large) stake at any moment, possibly as soon as lockup expires next week. If Trump wins election and FTC changes leadership, Nvidia will likely try to acquire ARM outright. Background: In late September 2020, [Nvidia announced plans to acquire ARM from Softbank]( for $40 billion. At that time, NVDA was \~ $400 billion company, 10x the value of ARM. In December 2021, the [FTC sues to block the merger]( citing anti-competitive advantages the combined firm would do in the AI race. On February 2022, Nvidia and Softbank announce [the termination of Nvidia acquitition of ARM Holdings]( and Softbank immediately announced plans to IPO ARM. ARM would IPO in September of 2023. All the major tech companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, META, Tesla, and many many others) are working to design their own chips, most are based on [ARM architecture]( and Jensen Huang sees the writing on the wall. Jensen also knows that his main competitors, including some of the big boys, are also champing at the bit to either get their own stake or prevent Nvidia from cornering the entire market outright. It's a race against the inevitable. If Nvidia was successful in acquiring ARM back in 2021, those $40 billion NVDA shares would be worth $220 billion to Softbank today if we go by the 10x valuation metric that both Nvidia and Softbank likely agreed upon back in 2020. TL;DR: Missed NVDA run, buy ARM shares or leaps. Not investment advice! &#x200B;",18.152056277056275

Nvidia has their GTC event next weekend but what after that? I'm hyped about what they will have in store and I think the AI train is here to stay for years to come but in the short term (1.5 months) I think Nvidia will start to fall and then crash after the GTC event. Regardless of what they announce, I don't think it will matter because it is priced in with the forward PE and the projected growth. I think there will be a time to buy back before $TSM earnings on 4/18 or a few weeks after. Long term bullish, short term bear. Position: 25 shares (sold 57 shares Friday) and a 20Jun25 250c I bought March 15th 2023, up 56k on the call but I plan to sell after the 15th for long term capital gains.",-2.375

If I got something wrong in the table above, tell me so I can cover my short. I also made stats for INTC's new GPU, but it didn't look as good, so I left them off. NVDA's high price/sales is justified by their huge margins -- 48% -- which they only have because competition has been non-existent. But that won't last, because they don't have a monopoly, TSMC has the monopoly. It isn't rocket science to run ML models on other GPUs, just nobody does because all non-NVDA chips suck (besides TPUs but GOOG is hoarding those because they didn't make enough of them). But anyone else can send TSMC a reasonable design and get their good GPU chip made, and AMD is finally going to do that. I don't know if it will help AMD, they seem richly valued themselves, but AMD over the decades, periodically sprung ahead in having the best offering in the CPU market over INTC and killed INTC's margins and crashed INTC's share price. AMD is about to do that to NVDA in GPUs. Also I hear NVDA engineers have gone soft now they are all rich.",21.073863636363637

719,2024-03-19 12:34:46,rayrayrex,NVDA will drop to 840 tomorrow,"1. The FOMC meeting is going to be extremely hawkish. No rate cut is coming until August at the earliest and this is due to the insane inflation we’re seeing both in the states and globally. Japan for the first time in 17 years has raised interest rates which will no doubt raise the cost of goods imported here, making inflation even worse domestically. This is a clear pattern we are seeing globally that will impact prices paid in the US 2. The market has lost enthusiasm for NVDIA in the current economic climate. They had one of the most stellar conferences where they announced they have their hands in every industry, where Wall Street had even raised price targets on them, and what happens? Everyone dumped the stock due to fears stemming from the FOMC meeting. Right now the market is pricing in 3 rate cuts but that just isn’t possible with the rate of inflation we are at right now. The entire market will tank tomorrow once retail pulls their head out of their behinds and acknowledges the facts 3. I bought calls 4. Even with all the good news it’s still months away from actually generating revenue for NVDIA. With high interest rates companies are better off buying bonds than trying to invest in building AI in a desperate attempt to cut costs. Without sufficient capital, big orgs will struggle to pay the hefty price for the newer Blackwell chips (which they won’t even be able to buy until the summer). As such NVIDA’s revenue will fall in the current environment and wall street knows this. That’s why they are pumping the stock while also buying short positions",5.023809523809524

725,2024-03-31 17:50:35,Ok-Quail4189,NVDA Spread update,"This is an update from my previous post [“Anyone ever gotten this?”]( First, here's the rundown of what happened: So, I had this genius plan to score an ""easy"" $500 by dealing with NVDA options. I sold 10 calls at the $902.5 strike for $2.75 each and hedged with 10 call contracts at the $900 strike that I got for $4.75. Quick math: that's a breakeven at $902, selling for $902.5, netting me a sweet $0.50 per share. But here's the kicker, I didn't know you could call your broker until 5:30 PM if your option expires in the money. Long story short, the buyer of my $902.5 strike calls ghosted, leaving me with 1000 shares of NVDA from the expired $900 strike calls and a cash account deficit of $897,813.87. Which is some RH BS because the shares were worth $901,250, but still stressful AF. I wasn't thrilled about being on the hook for $1000 for every $1 move in NVDA. But Robinhood's 24-hour market came in clutch. I unloaded those shares on Sunday night at $909.62 a pop, raking in a profit of $7.62 per stock. I probably could have made more if I held but I’m relieved I’m out. Crisis averted, tendies secured. 🚀💰🤑 TLDR: Robinhood told me I owed them almost $900k after I did an NVDA spread without knowing about DNE, so I almost got spread, but got lucky and ended up making $7k or 350% in four days.",26.212121212121215
726,2024-04-09 07:41:17,moldyjellybean,"Have your boomer parents or uber started talking about NVDA, AI? Is it time exit this ride.","Preface this with I'm a big NVDA AI fan been on the AI train for years before this 2 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I said they really have no peer in this space. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price. I was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong. Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE I had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled . I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top. Bless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top. EDIT: I just think it’s way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there. Much like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter. It was easy to see it’s very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the “street” or “market” pivots quickly. 5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance. When you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it’s almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won’t have large purchases. No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter. This business cycles and when it goes down it’ll go down for 2 years and rocket up after when people need to bulk order.",12.852698412698416

This is a crack-pot estimate that cannot factor in geo-political or economic changes in the future. Use at your own discretion\*\*\* \--- **\*\*Skip To End Game if You're Only Trying to Play Earnings\*\*** \-- # May 9-10th: the boring drop Due to ARM's shite guidance, NVDA as well as the rest of the semi-conductors are going to have a cool day tomorrow barring a sizeable increase in jobless claims (more jobless claims = economy doing crap, thus the Fed is more likely to cut interest rates, which Wall Street glazes themselves over). The reason? BS articles like this are being spread by the news that misattributes ARM's increase in pricing to the AI boom (of which it has no relation): [ Normies eat this shit up and if SPY ain't peaking in the morning we're going to see a decrease or flat market at best bleeding into Friday. Call/Put skew further shows that traders are consolidating at $900 into the pre-pre-earnings week: &#x200B; [ The gist of this is that if we have really good news, NVDA could hit $920 but with poor market news could hit a bottom of $875 by this Friday. With VIX (a measure of market volatility, which measures fear) being below 16 and hovering around 13, Market Makers are likely to feed into trends and buy dips so this is bullish in the market overall. # May 13-17th: the slight recovery then deep decline Heading into next week we are likely to see a recovery in price from the dip this week followed by a decline preceding earnings the following week. Why? Hedging. Wall Street as well as some retail investors are aware that the previous guidances issues were made under completely different macroeconomic expectations. Previously we were under the assumption that 3 rate cuts were coming whilst now only 1 possibly? The result is a drop in price akin to the previous earnings cycle but worse, given the poor earnings we've seen from fellow semiconductor manufacturers. The previous earnings cycle was actually positive across the board and what did we see? &#x200B; Roughly a $75 decline in share price during the week preceding earnings. And this was off of good news in the market. We could see the price hit sub-800 if everyone cashes out all at once in this week, if previous market behavior is anything to go off of. Depending on CPI on Wednesday and Jobless Claims on Thursday this could be mediated but we shall see. The likely range is 845-895 based on previous volatility around earnings. # May 20-22nd: Earnings END-GAME Nvidia will most likely continue it's drop from the previous week but this isn't a problem for us. Why? Because we know NVDA is the shit. I mean it truly is in another league of it's own. It quite literally is the industry standard that only those on the know are aware of. Their platform is what pretty much everyone who trains AI is using and will continue to use due to how optimized it is. We're talking about the comparison of an iPhone in 2008 to a flimsy flip phone. It's just so much more advanced that they are crushing the competition. This is why regardless of AMD, INTC, SMCI, all of their failures, NVDA will absolutely crush EPS, Revenue, and Guidance. [ They are the backbone of all AI training models right now and as it stands, no one is even close to touching them. Thus they will destroy expectations and rebound to even higher highs than Wall Street has expectations for due to their monopoly-like control of the industry. Barring a world war or FTC intervention, there is no way this stock can go down. &#x200B;",3.6118720689033186

They own the supply, so even if a competitor started to purchase nvidia Blackwell cluster, nvidia could just control the amount they sell to said competitor. The simple fact is this: they won and scaling laws say they will always win. Anyone who thinks or says “competitors will catch up” is a moron, and you should run far, far away from them.

Source: [ Positions: leaps \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ *According to reports from the supply chain, TSMC* [*(2330)*]( *is preparing to start producing NVIDIA’s latest Blackwell platform architecture graphics processor (GPU) in the near future. In response to strong customer demand, NVIDIA has increased its chip investment in TSMC by 25%, which not only means that the AI ​​market is booming Unprecedented, it also adds strong momentum to TSMC’s performance in the second half of the year and leaves the groundwork for raising its full-year outlook.* *TSMC will hold a legal meeting this Thursday (18th) and is currently in the silent period before the legal meeting. As of yesterday's deadline, no response from TSMC was received.* *The industry believes that with the news that TSMC has begun producing Blackwell platform architecture graphics processors (GPUs), it means that the countdown to the launch of Huida's AI server equipped with ""the most powerful AI chip on the surface"" will open a new page in the AI ​​industry, and is expected to become TSMC's The Dharma Conference is the focus of heated discussion.* *Analysts estimate that the average selling price (ASP) of the Huida B100 GPU built on the Blackwell architecture is US$30,000 to US$35,000, and the super chip GB200, which connects the Grace CPU and the B200 GPU in series, is priced between US$60,000 and US$70,000. The U.S. dollar is even higher, which means that Huida-related chips are the most expensive chips that TSMC has ever produced for terminals, and its investment in TSMC's operations is even more anticipated.* *Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU is known as the ""most powerful AI chip on the planet"". It is equipped with 208 billion transistors and is manufactured using TSMC's customized 4nm process. The GPU die is twice the mask size through a 10TB chip per second. The chip interconnect connects into a single, unified GPU and supports AI training and real-time large language model inference, with models scalable to 10 trillion parameters.* *According to industry insiders, major international manufacturers such as Amazon, Dell, Google, Meta, and Microsoft will introduce Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU to build AI servers, and the capacity exceeds expectations. To this end, Huida has increased its order for TSMC by about 25%. %.* *As Huida expands its Blackwell architecture GPU wafer production, in terms of the number of terminal server cabinets, shipments of GB200 NVL72 and GB200 NVL36 server cabinets have increased simultaneously, from the original expected combined shipment of 40,000 units. increased to 60,000 units, an increase of up to 50%, among which the total number of GB200 NVL36 reached 50,000 units.* *According to industry estimates, the average selling price of the GB200 NVL36 server cabinet is US$1.8 million, and the price of the GB200 NVL72 server cabinet is as high as US$3 million.

779,2024-07-26 08:39:51,CaspeanSea,"Chip Stocks Are Bottoming, Including $NVDA.","[$SMH Index]( Just a quick preface, if you don't like technical analysis then skip this one. It's not DD based on fundamentals, it's just technicals. The fundamentals for chip makers ( especially market leaders such as NVDA ) remain the same and remain positive. So I'm only looking at the technical aspect here, because the fundamentals haven't changed, yet. This is the daily chart for $SMH, the semiconductors index ( chip makers ) ETF. Semiconductors formed a double top in early July. A bearish technical structure that often indicates more downside is ahead. Double tops form all the time, but unless they're confirmed they're usually harmless. A double top is confirmed when price closes below the neckline ( the purple line ). This happened on July 17th. As soon as that happens we can extrapolate a full measured move. It's basically a price target that's equal to the distance between the top and the neckline. ( the vertical blue line you see is the full measured move ) If you take that distance and you place it below the neckline you get the downside target for this technical structure. As of yesterday, we have hit this downside target. A similar but slightly different bearish structure also formed when chip stocks topped in March-April. It wasn't a double top, but a slightly different variation. That looks like a spike, then an inverted cup. The spike represents euphoria and the inverted cup represents buyers trying to get going again to crack through the highs, but failing to get momentum going and eventually they give up and sell and it results in a sharp sell off and a bottom. Chip stocks also bottomed right around the full measured move down from the neckline back then. And it's happening again. This will sound a lot like meaningless mumbo jumbo reading tea leaves or astrology. In reality technical analysis works for two main reasons. 1- It's just a representation of investor sentiment and psychology. Just like an ECG is a chart of your heartbeat. There's no fortune telling, there's no clairvoyance. It's just putting market psychology in defined, measurable numbers on a chart. 2- It works because everyone uses the same concepts. Just like I saw this double top and full measured move, every technical analyst at every big bank will have seen the same thing and came to the same conclusion. I plan to build an aggressive position once an S&P 500 bottom is confirmed. We're getting very close here, probably just days away. I don't want to buy any chip stock until the S&P 500 bottoms. So for now, just waiting patiently.",12.564862914862914

Short DD,"No pun intended but this will be a short and simple DD on why you should be shorting NVDA leading up to earnings. 1) There seems to be no end in sight with Jensen’s scheduled sells. This matters because volume has been pretty low based on NVDA standards. “It’s only 250k sells though. He has 99% of his equity left”. It’s been 250k sells everyday since June. You do the math. 2) Look at the chart. NVDA reached a double top over the summer - a double peak always results in a sustained decline until it finds consolidation for a period of time. This is exactly what’s been happening. 3) The delay in Blackwell chip rollout is a big deal. In the past NVDA has hit on all cylinders. A trustworthy company yet this delay is a chink in the armor, a crack in the foundation, like seeing blood after your hero gets a paper cut. 4) Institutions aren’t buying. There is too much uncertainty with the broader market and it serves MMs well to depress the price in order to allow big money to buy in at lower prices. You all are trading amongst yourselves and buying Jensen’s bags. It’s that simple. My position: 8/30 100 $90 strike puts. Good luck to me.

Please accept this simple DD on why you should be longing NVDA leading up to earnings. 1) There seems to be no end in sight with Jensen’s ability to juice earnings releases. Is it the leather jacket? No. Well we don’t know for sure, but the last six ERs have resulted in an average reaction of roughly +8.5%. Isn’t that what Buffet earns on an annual basis? 2) Look at the chart. I’m not usually one for technical analysis, but it’s quite clear reviewing the chart on my Apple iPhone’s stocks app that we’ve reached the bottom of this selloff. Image attached for your reference. 3) The delay in Blackwell chip rollout is not a big deal if it’s even real. Jensen has been clear that demand for Hopper still exceeds supply. Someone did the math previously, but any impact of a 3 month delay is mitigated by the fact that they’ll simply sell more H200. Just Google “Blackwell delay” and you’ll see lots of articles on sites you’ve never heard of confirming the same. 4. Nancy Pelosi is still buying. She’s probably already seen the AGI locked in Sam’s basement. Don’t forget, this entire AI wave was kicked off by ChatGPT. That’s just the very tip of the AI iceberg that’s about to change the course of humanity’s future. Any upcoming product releases from the big players in this space are only going to reignite excitement for this technology and thusly shares of NVDA.

783,2024-08-14 22:46:25,notyourregularninja,Why NVDA will be $140+ by end of month,Why NVDA will again hit $140+ right after earnings is because it has been ordering chips heavily that has supplier companies such as TSMC increase revenue by 44% YOY even when nvidia is trying to diversify its supply chain. NVDA is actually also lagging a bit to fulfill demand so it is not like it is stockpiling. This is basic math that cannot be negated when looking at NVDA.

Yes I know basically everyone and their grandma is projecting NVDA to beat earnings, so IV on the contracts will be low. But if I bought the contracts two days before earnings when IV is already low, then I can save myself from an IV crush after earnings, and just ride up the actual price movement of NVDA which will very likely go up. If IV is extremely high on the day of earnings then I can just sell some of my contracts to capitalize on that, and then hold some for when IV crushes but the price moves up. Am I regarded or can this work?",9.333333333333334
789,2024-08-25 12:21:27,chewbaccashotlast,NVDA | How to make money in options,"4 times a year the biggest announcement comes upon us and yes here it is again this week! Needless to say the price action the next few weeks is going to ruin some of you and make others of you want to call nana. How can you make money on options this week? Well, I’ve written you a helpful guide to do so. Prior to Wednesday market close: - puts $3-5 OTM 8/30 expiry until NVDA crosses $125 or lower - $130 calls 8/30 expiry if NVDA falls below $125, then drop calls dollar for dollar (ex: if NVDA hits $122 buy $127 calls). - swing trade the shit out of this and close out all these mofos prior to earnings. Wednesday market close: - stay the F out. This stock will move a bunch AH but it’ll open no more than 3% higher Thursday and IMO will trade 3-5% lower. I think the channel for this is tightening up to really shake some branches in both legs of the options chain. Thursday Morning: - let that IV deflate and enter a long call position. What I am uncertain about is how quickly it will recover n rally. I would not be the least bit surprised if you see some downside Thursday Friday. - I will be watching closely and guess it will fall to below $110 very shortly after earnings. If it opens $125 or higher it may take 3 days for it otherwise I expect the downside to run its course by the weekend. - calls $5-10 OTM for 9/13 expiration. Of course that’s LEAPS to yall here so fine go with 9/6 I just don’t know how long it will do nothing before the do something meme no longer applies. TL/DR: Market makers will screw both sides of the options chain on earnings. Play puts leading up to ER if NVDA > $125 and calls if it falls below $125. Look for calls after ER timing Thursday might be tight wait until Friday go $5-10 OTM 2 weeks out. You’re welcome 😘",3.435374149659863

792,2024-08-27 07:36:10,blackSwanCan,Why NVDA is going to moon for next 2 quarters,"* In the last quarter(s), the big five have raised Capex spending on AI, and their guidance shows even higher Capex spending on AI infra. * There is a race to capture AI offerings between Google, Microsoft, Amazon, OpenAI, and other upstarts. Neither can give up that race, even if it means more infra spending. For example, Google's stock fell 20% over a small bug in their AI offering. * The LLM model sizes are increasing multifold, requiring more/better GPUs, which means more business for NVIDIA. The previous models are mostly useless. * Assemblers like SMCI have projected a doubling of sales in their recent earning, even with lower margins. * Nvidia keeps an insane margin and keeps raising it. Their ability to tell a story around the lower cost to operate, including net energy and compute has been bought by the market. Huangs says it is cheaper to run AI operations with a million-dollar Nvidia chip than a free chip from a competitor. * There is still no competition to either Nvidia chips or the Cuda programming and libraries that almost everyone uses for GPU ops. Nvidia has a 10-year lead on GPU programming and open libraries. * **A reversal of this trend would have telltale signs. None exist.** Tldr: Nvidia will beat the earnings and raise. The trend will continue for a few more quarters until a recession hits and Big 5 can't spend on infra. We will have bigger problems than Nvidia stock if that happens.",-0.5092592592592587
793,2024-08-27 17:52:35,AwarenessOk5979,Things to consider before betting it all on NVDA earnings tomorrow.,"**TLDR; I AM AS REGARDED as the next guy, but I recommend lowering exposure to NVDA earnings tomorrow to save money to play the aftermath.** Tomorrow is the Super Bowl of stocks. It's no secret that everyone down to the shoe shiner is balls deep in NVDA (mostly long, looking at the options chain) exposure. There are also those hoping for the end of the world to begin tomorrow. But the one thing we know about Wall Street as a certainty is that they don't like when retail wins. **We are all aware of the bull case. VERY simplified:** 1. Major tech companies have significantly increased CAPEX in Q2 and it doesn't take a genius to figure out where that money went. 2. Tech CEOs have been quoted as saying that underspending is more of an issue than overspending. *See* *also* Sam Altman (OpenAI) & Co. as being open supporters of the theory of effective accelerationism, which in a nutshell is the belief that the pursuit of general intelligence warrants all costs, natural and financial. 3. Nvidia is still founder led at this scale by Jensen Huang who is an amazing man and one of the greatest minds of our time. **The bear case is mostly about forward guidance, as pretty much everyone believes there will be an EPS beat. This is mostly macroeconomic and includes:** 1. Concerns about tech companies not being able to profit from AI spending, leading to winding down. Rebuttal: We're not going to see this materialize this quarter. Tech has barely dipped their toes into seeing what value they can extract out of the newest line of hardware. It is simply too early to see. Even if you don't buy that, see previous point about under/overspending. 2. Blackwell delays Rebuttal: Priced in, much like the heat death of the universe itself. But really, who cares about this. Blackwell is still the only game in town. 3. US economy slowing, 800k jobs just ""lost"" while stocks are nearing ATH, election concerns, general stuff like that. Rebuttal: No rebuttal. Completely legitimate to believe that a large correction is looming, if you're not kidding yourself. **So why not move all in tomorrow? 50/50 is better odds than what retail usually get anyways.** You all know about IV crush, how NVDA is already priced to jump basically 10% after earnings, and all that. If you need to play options, please consider getting ones longer than August 30, which will be impacted the most. September 20 seems like a fair middle ground between ""fun"" leverage and having enough time to correct the ship should things go bad. You also all know that the world is watching these earnings the way we watch a groundhog come out of a hole to tell us if there are going to be six more weeks of winter or early spring. If you are patient enough to hold cash and simply wait to see the outcome, you WILL make money on placing a directionally good bet - with the benefit of being able to scoop up IV crushed options. It is also possible to hold SPY calls/puts as a proxy for NVDA to lessen the impact of IV crush. It is a likely reality that big money is able to keep the prices pinned this week so that these 130's expire cheap or worthless. A massive 128.60 institutional buy wall was briefly up today, before the stint over 129, which suggests to me that smart money/funds are keeping dry powder ready. Please consider which would minimize regret: missing out on winning the big 50/50 or not having the funds to act on what will be very well informed plays for the direction of the entire market over the next 1-2 months. Thank you very much, may God protect our savings.",15.166609155739582

805,2024-10-19 08:51:08,Opening-Reindeer-112,Puts on NVDA for Monday based on past 3 months data,"So i decided to do some data analysis with ChatGPT on the NVDA stock prices and came across some interesting data. Yesterday's bar for NVDA was an inside bar. For those that are not familiar, an inside bar is when its high is lower than the previous days high and low is higher than the previous days low. So I decided to find out what happened the last many times this has happened. There have been 12 instances of this since July 2024 and guess what, 6 of them have formed on a Friday. Here is the list of all fridays when this happened - || || |9/13/2024| |8/30/2024| |8/23/2024| |7/26/2024| |7/19/2024| |7/12/2024 | 5 of these 6 times the stock tanked the next monday and tuesday. the only time it went higher on monday was on 19th July, but it was down by wednesday and deep in red by Friday. TLDR: Inside bar analysis from past 3 months shows that NVDA stock price will fall on Monday or by end of next week. Edit1: Since someone pointed out that NVDA was in a bear trend since july and this was bound to happen. Here is list of all dates on Friday within the last year when we had an inside bar formed: || || |9/13/2024| |8/30/2024| |8/23/2024| |7/26/2024| |7/19/2024| |7/12/2024| |4/12/2024| |4/5/2024| |1/12/2024| |11/24/2023| |10/27/2023| Out of the 12 dates, on 10 occasions the price fell the next monday and tuesday.

806,2024-10-21 14:04:25,paypropda,NVDA I will cheer for you,"On Monday, NVIDIA surpassed last week's intraday high of $140.89, closing up 4.14% to set a new closing all-time high of $143.71, and closed with a market capitalization of $3.53 trillion, closing in on Apple's $3.6 trillion market cap. Despite last Tuesday's dip in NVIDIA's stock price after ASML's earnings blowout, and the market's concerns about slowing AI spending remain, NVIDIA's stock price still recorded a 2% gain last week, a cumulative increase of more than 50% over the bottom at the time of the market's collapse in early August. Wall Street analysts continue to be firmly bullish on NVIDIA ahead of its November earnings report. According to Bloomberg survey statistics, analysts expect NVIDIA shares to rise to $ 148.37 in the next 12 months, including a number of highly bullish analysts on NVIDIA, for example: On Friday, Bank of America raised its Nvidia price target from $165 to $190. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya, among others, said buying Nvidia is a “once-in-a-generation opportunity.” Last week, investment research firm CFRA raised its price target on NVIDIA from $139 to $160. In the view of Bank of America analysts, the overall AI market demand is growing strongly, in addition to this is also worth noting that NVIDIA's strong performance in the field of enterprise AI, such as partnerships with Microsoft and Accenture and other companies, Bank of America to raise its target price of the other factor, NVIDIA is the preferred partner for enterprise AI hardware and software. Wedbush analyst and NVIDIA majority owner Dan Ives expressed a similar sentiment in a report sent to investors on Sunday. He claimed that enterprise spending is growing in giant waves as AI adoption scenarios explode, and NVIDIA is leading the way. Ives predicts that the AI infrastructure market will grow tenfold between now and 2027, with companies investing $1 trillion in AI capital expenditures during that time. “In short, we think tech stocks are poised for another 20% rally in 2025, and this tech bull market driven by the AI revolution is just entering its next phase. We believe that the Fed and Powell have initiated an aggressive rate-cutting cycle, that a soft macroeconomic landing is still the way forward, and that tech spending on AI is a crossover spending wave that is just getting off the ground in the tech sector.”",6.665501165501166

809,2024-11-02 08:17:45,Kazgarth_,Why I think TSM/INTC will outpace NVDA/AMD growth in the next decade. ,"Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are spending billions of CapEx on AI. Lets just look at their last 2 quarters spending: * **Amazon**: Increased CapEx from $60 billion in Q2 2024 to $70 billion in Q3 2024. * **Google**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion in the same period. * **Microsoft**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion. * **Meta**: Increased CapEx from $29 billion to $31 billion. However not all that CapEx is going to third party AI solutions like Nvidia/AMD. Each and every company listed above has or is developing it's own custom AI silicon. Lets look how they are transitioning from 3rd party to In-House AI silicon: **Amazon**: Developed AWS Inferentia and Tranium chips for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC). **Google**: Developed Tensor Processing Unite (TPU) and Axion chip for AI processing (manufactured by TSM). **Microsoft**: Developed Azure Maia AI chip and Azure Cobalt for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC). **Meta**: Developed Meta trading and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) for AI processing (manufactured by TSM). All those developments reduce dependence on external GPU suppliers, allow more customized/efficient AI processing and most importantly huge cost savings. Just to understand the level of savings (and why would they invest huge R&D budget on this): A **regular Nvidia H100 GPU**, cost approximately **$3,320** to manufacture from TSMC. However it is being sold at **$25,000 to $30,000** each! That's almost 800%-900% profit margins that has to be paid by the companies above, when they opt not to choose In-House Silicon. As more of the AI CapEx goes to custom silicon (will never be 100%, but expect that percentage only to grow larger over time, driven by cost savings) TSMC and Intel foundries will benefit directly from this trend (both have EUV capabilities, INTC will mass produce 18A EUV chips next year, with Amazon as first client) And this will position TSMC and INTC for substantial growth, because **the rate limiting factor for AI growth will be how much silicon can TSMC or INTC manufacture** for the entire world's AI demand.",12.884615384615387

Grandaddy died in April this year leaving a 3 generation farm, (fully paid, no debt) to my parents. Mom never worked and my dad’s income has never been much (minister at small church). Unsurprisingly, mom and dad want to cash in on that sweet sweet inheritance $$$ by selling the farm and upgrading their lifestyle with the proceeds. I would give my right kidney to keep that farm if I knew how to sell it. It’s where I grew up, convinced my girlfriend (now wife) to marry me, and want our two small children to make their own memories there. I’ve traded positions in $NVDA, $ASTS, $RKLB and $RDDT (thanks to this community) hoping to somehow make enough to buy the farm but have only managed roughly to double my money ($15K to $32K). I completely realize it’s an idiot move but it’s the only chance I have at this point and I’m 100% willing to go to $0 if there is a chance I can make it to $1.1MM. The farm is going to be listed next week and I want to go full regard with my portfolio to buy it. If I sell my house I still need $1.1MM to make up the difference and I’m willing to bet everything I have in the market for the chance to make it happen. Would happily go all-in on anything that might print before February since the farm will probably be sold around that time. Before anyone asks, there is no other way. My folks want the $$$ now and won’t sell the farm for any less than market value to me or anyone else. Renting the tillable acres to a local farmer would only cover 1.5 months of the mortgage payment. Maybe the best offer is $800K, maybe the real estate market crashes tomorrow, but bottom line is I have to close the gap between $35K and $1.1MM to have any shot at keeping it.

But Rack/ Data Center Tech Design and Architecture, there will BE ZERO INCENTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS TO GO TO COMPETITORS WHEN RACK ARCHITECTURE THAT FITS BLACKWELL GPU's with ZERO ISSUE, IS COMPLETELY OUT IN THE OPEN: READ SUMMARY( this is why AMD and INTEL are having such a hard time competing and frankly anybody else, unless you're DELL and WORKING with Jensen... But Dell doesn't make chips, so their good bros and compliment each other very well in many ways, STILL NVDA HAS IT'S OWN DATA CENTER RACK TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOT DELL'S AND IT IS NOW OPEN SOURCE- FROM COOLING TO ETHERNET AND SCALING DATA TECHNOLOGY... GIVING THEM A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE.. vs those that want to take away their Data Center Service / Business : This OCP summit with this open sourcing debut specifically for Blackwell tech was as of last month, Oct 17th. ( Jensen is busy busy busy ) ""At this year’s OCP Global Summit, NVIDIA will be sharing key portions of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system’s electro-mechanical design with the OCP community — including the rack architecture, compute and switch tray mechanicals, liquid-cooling and thermal environment specifications, and NVIDIA NVLink™ cable cartridge volumetrics—to support higher compute density and networking bandwidth."" ..""said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “By advancing open standards, we’re helping organizations worldwide take advantage of the full potential of accelerated computing and create the AI factories of the future.” [ Everybody KNOWS there is a plateau. A plateau and lower business revenues based on estimates that TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT INFERENCE IS LESS DEMANDING THAN TRAINING. THAT BEING SAID, MARKET IS NO LONGER LOOKING FOR INSANE NUCLEAR GROWTH. BUT STEADY HEALTHY GROWTH. THAT\*\* WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. Crazy AI nuclear growth, is not what the market is expecting. Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four... NVDA continues to climb on growth, steady healthy growth, not insane nuclear growth. THAT WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. It has no where else to go. Ive's and Wedbush, are ENTIRELY correct. Dan Ives and Josh Brown Discuss NVDA [ Lastly NVDA will own the entire vertical from Hyperscaler to Retail Individual end user level, why? NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?.. I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about. And as far as I know, Biden or Trump won't block sales of regular computer pc windows chips to China or anywhere else for that matter. :) Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda). People will hunt down a windows PC that has both* NVDA* gpu AND CPU* chips. Here is the link for more info= ""Not just that, but NVIDIA is also cooking up its new GeForce RTX 50 series ""Blackwell"" desktop graphics cards, and its new GeForce RTX 50 Laptop series ""Blackwell"" mobile GPUs, which will end up being featured inside of these new AI PCs with an NVIDIA + MediaTek CPU based on the Arm architecture."" ""NVIDIA has also previously said that RTX is the ""Premium"" AI PC platform, and that CPUs and SoCs launching with new NPUs (Neural Processing Units for AI workloads) are for ""Basic"" AI PCs. The company is right, as a decent discrete GeForce RTX GPU can blow away any NPU inside of any CPU now, and for years to come."" ""The new silicon will support advanced technologies, and will be mass-produced on TSMC's new 3nm process node, and will compete against Apple's new M4 chip, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X processors."" ""NVIDIA is aiming for high-end segment with its first consumer CPU, expected in 2025 NVIDIA and MediaTek's upcoming AI PC processor is expected to enter the high-end market in September 2025, with a wider release 'expected in March 2026'."" Read more: Read more: other link = ""However, you'd think it would lean heavily on Nvidia's graphics technology. Ultimately, you'd expect it to offer the best graphics performance on the market."" DAMN STRAIGHT. ""The implication** with this new PC chip for 2025 is that it may well (It WILL, no 'may' it will) debut a new* in-house CPU core design from Nvidia. It would certainly be far more interesting if it did. (it will)That would also enable Nvidia to offer something much more performant than Arm's own CPU core designs."" aaand = ""And make no mistake, the Arm instruction set allows for some very high performance CPU cores these days. By some measures, Apple's latest CPU cores in the M4 have 60% better IPC (or performance per clock cycle) than anything Intel or AMD currently offer."" And these cpu chips to come out officially in September 2025, but anouncement dates and getting market ready will start first half of 2025, likely this ER starts talking about it or beginning of next year... Commercial anouncement will be THE FIRST HALF OF 2025 or first qtr of 2025 yr proper... but you never know, Jensen might pull an early bird push this into the EARLY first half of 2025... Very likely Jensen talks about these babies in this coming CC next Friday?, we'll see. But it's happening either way. And market will value and trade NVDA accordingly. Millions of PC's with NVDA CPU's, as far as I can remember Biden cant block normal PC chips for normal computers to China or anywhere else for that matter. link = ""Nvidia is preparing to introduce a high-end Arm-based CPU and GPU platform for consumers in September 2025, with a 'commercial launch in March 2026,' according to the report."" other link = link = I'm not your mom. Just an OP. Read and discuss and be nice to each other. And remember to hedge like a good little boy and girl.",11.415397622146088

The major tech companies, the Seven Sisters and other giants like that, and the relatively large data center capex is expected to grow 24% to $282 billion by 2025...

It's just been on a non-stop upward train since launching from its $6 price point. Even yesterday at an all-red market drop, the stock hardly erased much of its gains at all. It's just absolutely bonkers and even makes less sense than Tesla honestly, especially considering the stock has a lower buy rating than others like LUNR. At this point I guess we can just throw all-in calls and make guaranteed money in RKLB huh?",7.3611111111111125
