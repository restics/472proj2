2024-01-08 11:26:20,4xkeef,Nvda I don’t think anyone saw this coming,Nvda received massive bullish news heading into this week. My question is did anyone see this coming or were we all bearish ?  & 2 where does opportunity lye moving forward ? Honestly thought it would take more time than this .. started to buy calls this morning.
2024-01-08 19:27:03,Slut_Spoiler,All Aboard The Pelosi Express To Tendie Town! (NVDA $120c 12/20/2024),
2024-02-05 07:25:29,plutrons,NVDA pullback imminent,
2024-02-05 12:36:34,Domethegoon,"NVDA made only $4.37B in 2023 and currently has a $1.7T market cap. For comparison, MSFT made $72B in 2023 and has a $3T market cap.",
2024-02-06 08:51:23,Sexy_Kumquat,NVDA is worth 100B more than the entire US energy sector!,"Not saying anything about valuation, but that’s pretty telling.
Of course that means that MSFT is worth about twice the entire US energy sector."
2024-02-08 17:08:47,rayrayrex,NVDA will drop into the 670’s tomorrow because,"1. No more catalysts from other companies to artificially boost interest. With volume decreasing day over day and price falling, a reversal is likely given the failed push past $700

2. Competition from ARM has actually had a negative impact on NVIDIA’s stock today as investors flocked to alternatives, while ARM continued to rise. The original boost on Thursday was far more likely attributed to Morgan Stanley increasing their price target $750

3. Every Thursday of this year if the stock went sideways/decreased into the end of the day, the stock would drop $15-20 the next day (save for catalysts from other corps - which aren’t coming). Similar pattern can be seen on any chart where NVDA has declined or traded flat the previous day 

4. Institutional investors are not going to be buying anymore stock knowing a sharp correction is imminent 2 weeks out. They will be far more inclined to lock profit in and sell as the price dips and corrects before buying back in the 70-80’s.

4.5. NVDA’s previous guidance is going to screw them at earnings as the market has expectations beyond anything they themselves broadcasted, which will lead to a correction down to the mid 600’s

5. I bought calls for 680 expiring tomorrow

Edit: it will hit 670s then rebound and trade flat around 680ish. Then next week will drop some more before spiking and crashing"
2024-02-09 07:57:22,plutrons,NVDA has to pull back right?,
2024-02-09 13:47:18,rayrayrex,NVDA will fall on Monday to 700 because,"1. We are facing resistance at 720 which signals a retracing with the decreasing volume. This has historically always been followed by a fall of 1-3%

2. Anytime the stock has soared 15-20$ it is followed by a sideways movement in the market followed by a drop. Since institutional investors are aware we know this, they will sell off a day early on Monday instead of Tuesday

3. There’s no more catalysts coming up. Today’s boom was brought on by the announcement of their custom chip segment which is now already priced in. They cannot have any more surprises ahead of earnings without risking a boost in price beyond analyst forecasts which causes their price to crater

4. Institutional investors saw my last post listing a decrease in price and bought in droves to drive out what they perceive as the majority of WSB investors. Since the OG meme stock they have been scared of us and actively use the sentiment in our posts to bet against us. It had over 500k impressions meaning it was definitely on their radar

5. Basic game theory: earnings will be nowhere close to the expectations of the guidance given by NVDA, and institutional investors know this. As such the usual approach where buying options 2 weeks ahead of earnings to capitalize on volatility is moot. It’s a race against time to see which big player sells first while they try to maximize their gains. Once one player sells, it will trigger a cascading effect causing the price to drop fast. We could see 690’s

6. I bought calls expiring 2/16 at $690

7. I want to double down on institutional investors being aware of this post. They will sell off/trade side ways to go against the trending posts in this sub

Edit: my original post had 800k impressions 

Edit 2: after market is flat instead of gapping up which usually happens after a run up like this. Institutional investors are weary of this post and its implications "

2024-02-13 22:10:49,Xtianus21,NVDA is Worth $1000+ This Year - AI Will Be The Largest Wealth Transfer In The History of The World - Sam Altman Wasn't Joking...,"**UPDATE2: Open AI Release Massive Update SORA Text/Speech to Video**  
[https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24074151/openai-sora-text-to-video-ai](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24074151/openai-sora-text-to-video-ai)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEuEMwU45Hs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEuEMwU45Hs)

**UPDATE: Sam Altman Tells the World (literally** [The World Governments Summit](https://youtu.be/JVatgo0TJIw?si=3-Jkw9F3ZlkilulX&t=61)**) that** [GPT-5 Is Going To Be a Big Deal](https://youtu.be/-Mca6eN81Is?si=Ym59zLD2VZ2yefZU) **- GPT-5 Will Be Smarter Across The Board - Serious AGI in 5 - 10 Years.**

**THIS IS WAR - And Nvidia is the United States Military Industrial Complex, The Mongol Empire, and Roma combined.**

AI will be as large as the internet and then it will surpass it. AI is the internet plus the ability to reason and analyze anything you give it in fractions of a second. A new unequivocal boomstick to whomever wants to use it.

The true winners will be those startups in fields such as robotics, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, space-aeronautics, aviation, protein synthesis, new materials and so, so much more who will use AI in new and exciting ways.

Boston dynamics, set to boom. Self-driving robotaxis, set to boom. Flying taxis, set to boom. Job replacement/automation for legacy industry jobs white collar, set to boom. Personal AI agents for your individual workloads, booming. Healthcare change as we know it (doctors won't like this but too bad), set to boom.

The amount of industry that is set to shift and mutate and emerge from AI in the next 3 - 5 years will be astonishing.

I can tell you, standing on principal, that OpenAI's next release will be so game changing that nobody will deny where AI is heading. There is not a rock you can hide under to be so oblivious as to not see where this is going.

The reason why I bring up the next iteration of ChatGPT, GPT5, is because they are initiators of this phenomenon. Other, such as Google (and others) are furiously trying to catch up but as of today the 'MOAT' may be upon us.

The reason to believe that one may catch up (or try like hell to) is from the amount of compute power from GPU's it takes to train an ungodly amount of data. Trillions of data points. Billions (soon to be Trillions) of parameters all simulating that of the synaptic neuron connections in which the human brain functions that in turn gives us the spark of life and consciousness. Make no mistake, these guys are living out a present day Manhattan project.

These people are trying to build consciousness agency with the all the world's information as a reference document at it's finger tips. Today.

And guess what. The only way these guys can build that thing - That AGI/ASI/GAI reality - Is through Nvidia.

These guys believe and have tested that if you throw MORE compute at the problem it actually GAINS function. More compute equals more consciousness. That's what these people believe and they're attempting it.

Here, let me show you what I mean. What the graph below shows is that over time the amount of data and parameters that are being used to train an AI model. I implore you to watch this video as it is a great easy to understand educational video into what the hell is going on with all of this AI stuff. It's a little technical but very informative and there are varying opinions. I pulled out the very best part in relation to Nvidia here. [AI: Grappling with a New Kind of Intelligence](https://youtu.be/EGDG3hgPNp8?si=L71CUbmqho3jhKEh&t=3768)

https://preview.redd.it/vk5twc041hic1.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3d2bdf42cf25e1c04e940b2f61d0219871f2334

It's SO RIDICULOUS that you wouldn't be able to continue to see the beginning so they have to use a log plot chart. And as you see we are heading into Trillions of parameters. For reference GPT-4 was trained on roughly 200 billion parameters.

https://preview.redd.it/6cq17n5i1hic1.png?width=1327&format=png&auto=webp&s=830334aa7cdaddfa10d7f6512d10025f136076ed

It is estimated GPT-5 will be trained with 2-5 trillion parameters.

Sam Altman was dead ass serious when he is inquiring about obtaining $7 trillion for chip development. They believe that with enough compute they can create GOD.

So what's the response from Google, Meta and others. Well, they're forming ""AI """"Alliances"""""". Along with that they are going to and buying from the largest AI arms dealer on earth; Nvidia.

Nvidia is a common day AI Industrial Complex War machine.

**Sovereign AI with AI Foundries**

It's not just companies that are looking to compete it's also entire Nation States. Remember, when Italy banned GPT. Well, it turns out, countries don't want the United States building and implementing their AI into other country's culture and way of life.

So as of today, you have a battle of not just corporate America but entire countries looking to buy the bullets, tanks and missiles needed for this AI fight. Nvidia sells the absolute best bullets, the best guns, the best ammo one needs to attempt to create their own AI epicenters.

And it's so important that it is a national security risk to not just us the United States but to be a nation and not have the capability of AI.

Remember the leak about Q\* and a certain encryption being undone. You don't think heads of State where listening to that. Whether it was true or not it is now an imperative that you get with AI or get left behind. That goes just as much for a nation as it does for you as an individual.

When asked about the risk of losing out sales to China on Nvidia's last earnings call Jensen Huang clearly stated he was not worried about it because literally nations are coming online to build AI foundries.

**Nvidia's Numbers and The Power Of Compounding**

The power of compounding and why I think there share price is where it is today and has so much more room to grow. Let me ask you a question but first let me say that AWS's annual revenues are at \~$80/Y Billion. How long do you think with Nvidia's revenues of \~$18/Q Billion to reach or eclipse AWS at a 250% growth rate?

15 years? 10 Years? 5 years? Answer: 1.19 years. Ok let's not be ridiculous perhaps it's 200% instead.

5 years? Nope. 1.35 years.

Let's say they have a bad quarter and Italy doesn't pay up. 150%

5 years right? Nope. 1.62 years.

Come on they can't keep this up. 100%.

has to be 5 years this time. Nope. 2.15 years.

100% growth/2.15 years to 250% growth/1.19 years to reach 80 billion in annual revenues.

They're growth last year was 281%.

So wait, I wasn't being fair. I used $80 billion for AWS while their revenues last year where $88 Billion and Nvidia's last years 4 quarters where \~$33 Billion.

Here are those growth numbers it would take Nvidia to reach $88 billion.

At 279% =  0.73 years

At 250% = 0.78 years

At 200% = 0.89 years

at 100% = 1.41 years

Folks. That's JUST the data center. They are poised to surpass AWS, Azure and Google Cloud in about .73 to 1.5 years. Yes, you heard that right, your daddy's cloud company is about to be overtaken by your son's gaming GPU company.

When people say Nvidia is undervalued. This is what they are talking about. This is a P/S story not a P/E story.

[https:\/\/ycharts.com\/indicators\/nvidia\_corp\_nvda\_data\_center\_revenue\_quarterly](https://preview.redd.it/xa46amh0dhic1.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e9116e55235991b1113713b5b7cd7d30c58d515)

This isn't a stonk price. This is just Nvidia executing ferociously.

This isn't Y2k and the AI ""dot-com"" bubble. **This is a reckoning.** This is the largest transfer of wealth the world has ever seen.

Look at the graph. Look at the growth. That's all before the next iteration of GPT-5 has even been announced.

I will tell you personally. The things that will be built with GPT-5 will truly be mind blowing. That Jetson cartoon some of you may have watched as a kid will finally be a reality coming to you soon in 2024/2025/2026.

The foundation of work being laid now is only the beginning. There will be winners and there will be loser but as of today:

**$NVDA** is fucking **KING**

For those of you who still just don't believe or are thinking this has to end sometimes. Or fucking Cramer who keeps saying be careful and take some money out and on and on. Think about this.

It costs you to just open an enterprise Nvidia data center account \~$50k via a ""limited time offer""

To train a model a major LLM could cost millions who knows maybe for the largest model runs BILLIONS.

Everyone is using them from Nation States to AWS, Microsoft, Meta, Google, X. Everybody is using them.

I get it. The price of the stock being so high and the valuation makes you pause. The price is purely psychological especially when they are hitting so many data points regarding revenues. The stock will split and rightly so (perhaps next year) but make not mistake this company is firing on ALL cylinders. The are executing S Tier. Fucking Max 9000 MX9+ Tier. Some god level tier ok.

There will be shit money that hits this quarter with all the puts and calls. The stock may rescind this quarter who knows. All i'm saying is you have the opportunity to buy into one of the most prolific tech companies the world has ever known. You may not think of them as the Apples or the Amazons or the Microsoft's or the Google's and that's ok. Just know that they are 1000% percent legit and AI has just gotten started.

Position: 33% of my portfolio. Another 33% in$Arm. Why? Because What trains on Nvidia will ultimately run/inference on ARM. And 33% Microsoft (OAI light).

If OpenAI came out today public I would have %50 of my portfolio in OAI i'll tell you that.

This is something you should have and should own in your portfolio. It's up to you to decide how much. When you can pay your children's college. When you can finally get that downpayment on that dream house. When you can buy that dream car you've always wanted. Feel free to drop a thank you.

TLDR; BUY NVIDIA, SMCI and ARM. This is not financial advice. The contents of this advertisement where paid by the following... ARM (;)"
2024-02-14 09:05:38,AcrobaticDependent35,Shorting NVDA at 740 is literally free money at this point,"**Why**

The expectation is that they greatly exceed earnings - so even if they do, the pop won't be anything insane, maybe 6-8% or so. That's probably what's going to happen.

However. If they even slightly falter, then it's going to crater 10-15% at a minimum - I see 650 as a reasonable spot to exit honestly.

I'm just seeing all of the little slots on SoFi that dozens and dozens of people are buying in and it feels like they're lambs being brought to slaughter. Double top, majority of investors only in it for the momentum (which has been waning the last few days), Google's chips, so many reasons for it to fall and for it to fall \_now\_.

I'm a software engineer at an AI startup and yeah I see the insane costs/demand for these but it's a \_hardware\_ company and not software that can scale infinitely at no marginal cost. Now that I think about it, I really think I should've invested in it when I first saw that side of things but now I'm just doing it out of spite. Or that the one other big short I did was COIN from 180 => 150 and this feels the same sentiment-wise. idk either way works

**Positions**

* (-20) NVDA @ 705 - 134% of that account, started on 02-06
* 200 NVD @ 8.95 fifteen minutes ago
* Other more reasonable choices

**Afterword**

Well in the time I wrote this it fell from 740 to 727 so never mind I guess, it's slightly less profitable of a trade but the point still stands (which is left as an exercise for the reader)

**Edit**

[This account](https://preview.redd.it/5spcopmb3lic1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6420b7f09a517d74c6dde2846422073376fd5ca)

**Edit 2**

* Closed NVD @ 9.27

**Edit 3**

* Y'all - It is just money guys and here's the thing: I don't lose when it is worth more than my account (cause it already is). I lose when the *losses* are worth more than my account. Just going to hold through earnings, any losses are offset by the money market interest anyways

**Edit 4**

* NVD is 1.5x inverse NVDA. I did not close the NVDA lol  


**Edit 5**

* My oh my the bullish comments have slowed down! What happened?!? 
* Anyways those were kind of proving my point. The price reflected something like 99% chance of maintaining zero competition and continuing the insane growth for like a decade. That's true that's what it looks like now, and I feel like the underlying facts are going to change soon for its valuation. The price reflected something like a 99% chance of absolutely demolishing earnings and didn't leave a lot of upside for if they even do. 
* Also, I felt like that was the reverse sort of effect happening - only people buying at that level were shorts capitalizing and it's kind of like how we hit a super-bottom in 2022 from margin calls. Shorts have already \*been\* getting wrecked which is why it was a better entry at 740 than say 500.
* I can't even drink yet so stop trying to flex your buys from when I was in middle school lol"

Prediction is NVDA goes north of $750 by EOW. Yes > 10% gains in next few days. They had to drop it to show the increase wasn’t so bad.

2024-02-21 14:56:15,McKoijion,I told my grandson I have 4000 NVDA shares so he'll wipe my ass,"TL;DR: my gullible grandson wipes my ass to get into my will because I told him I bought 4,000 $NVDA shares (1,000 shares pre 4:1 split) in 2018/2019 and am now sitting on >$2.5 million in NVDA.

I'm 87 and immobile in a wheelchair and don't know anything about semiconductors or anything else technology related. I cannot Google or text, and I currently have someone who lives in my home 24/7 and wipes my ass for me. However, I'm a damn intuitive savant when it comes to tricking gullible kids.

I did grow up in the biggest bull market in human history with some Boomers printing money like Chuck E. Cheese bucks.. and everyone is a genius in a bull market.. Well almost everyone. I didn't invest so now I just scam Millennials and Zoomers.

Anyway, I like talking stocks with my grandson because it’s something we could connect on, and I have a ton of experience selling worthless advice to idiots. So in 2018 we were talking about the market, and I casually brought up Nvidia. He thought I didn't guide him to that at all. He bought Nvidia in 2017 so he was familiar with it although he bought his shares at 18 yrs old with $2k he had saved up. Nothing insane although he kept 90% to this day. I said I saw NVIDIA in a newspaper article with someone recommending it for elderly’s retirement accounts. So I told my grandson I was an OGangster, called my broker and bought 1,000 shares on the spot because in my words: “I don’t buy a stock if I can’t afford 1,000 shares”. Something only the Zoomers dumb enough to buy meme stocks would fall for. 

He was dumbstruck because here he thought he was doing great with his savings over the years, and I just humbled his ass with a completely made up sentence. Add in the 4:1 stock split, and now he thinks I'm sitting on 4,000 shares. (I ""confirmed"" it to him when he brought it up in the last month). I haven't sold a dime and don't even know what the price is doing day to day because I don't own any shares.  I'm just chilling in my wheelchair and letting him try to get a bigger share of the inheritance. He called and celebrated with me the other day because he transparently wants to get in my will. He thinks I'm already wealthy and dumb enough to drop 6 figures on a stock I know little about.

He hopes to inherit my wealth someday, but he’s also a scammy, golddigging SOB and he knows it! Told me “haha you're a genius investor and luck has nothing to do with”. Thought id share here because I’m not sharing this IRL, but I find it pretty ironic my dumb ass grandson is outwiping 95% of this sub. Wendy's boys included."

2024-03-06 09:37:49,cbusoh66,"If you missed the NVDA train, buy ARM","Summary: I fully expect Nvidia and Jensen Huang to go after ARM and acquire a (rather large) stake at any moment, possibly as soon as lockup expires next week. If Trump wins election and FTC changes leadership, Nvidia will likely try to acquire ARM outright. 

Background: In late September 2020, [Nvidia announced plans to acquire ARM from Softbank](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion-creating-worlds-premier-computing-company-for-the-age-of-ai) for $40 billion. At that time, NVDA was \~ $400 billion company, 10x the value of ARM. In December 2021, the [FTC sues to block the merger](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger) citing anti-competitive advantages the combined firm would do in the AI race. On February 2022, Nvidia and Softbank announce [the termination of Nvidia acquitition of ARM Holdings](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-softbank-group-announce-termination-of-nvidias-acquisition-of-arm-limited) and Softbank immediately announced plans to IPO ARM. ARM would IPO in September of 2023. 

All the major tech companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, META, Tesla, and many many others) are working to design their own chips, most are based on [ARM architecture](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/11/09/how-arm-gained-chip-dominance-with-apple-nvidia-amazon-and-qualcomm.html) and Jensen Huang sees the writing on the wall. Jensen also knows that his main competitors, including some of the big boys, are also champing at the bit to either get their own stake or prevent Nvidia from cornering the entire market outright. It's a race against the inevitable. 

If Nvidia was successful in acquiring ARM back in 2021, those $40 billion NVDA shares would be worth $220 billion to Softbank today if we go by the 10x valuation metric that both Nvidia and Softbank likely agreed upon back in 2020. 

TL;DR: Missed NVDA run, buy ARM shares or leaps. Not investment advice!

4. NVDA will have deep roots in every industry, including weather, biology, construction, warehousing, logistics, everything

5. Databases will become intelligence generators. AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, ORCL are also going to Jupiter, likely operating as NVDA, erm sorry SKYNET subsidiaries

6. Black leather jackets will indefinitely be the new fashion craze and be perpetually sold out

Long live Jensen Huang, long live NVDA.

2024-03-19 12:34:46,rayrayrex,NVDA will drop to 840 tomorrow,"1. The FOMC meeting is going to be extremely hawkish. No rate cut is coming until August at the earliest and this is due to the insane inflation we’re seeing both in the states and globally. Japan for the first time in 17 years has raised interest rates which will no doubt raise the cost of goods imported here, making inflation even worse domestically. This is a clear pattern we are seeing globally that will impact prices paid in the US

2. The market has lost enthusiasm for NVDIA in the current economic climate. They had one of the most stellar conferences where they announced they have their hands in every industry, where Wall Street had even raised price targets on them, and what happens? Everyone dumped the stock due to fears stemming from the FOMC meeting. Right now the market is pricing in 3 rate cuts but that just isn’t possible with the rate of inflation we are at right now. The entire market will tank tomorrow once retail pulls their head out of their behinds and acknowledges the facts 

3. I bought calls

4. Even with all the good news it’s still months away from actually generating revenue for NVDIA. With high interest rates companies are better off buying bonds than trying to invest in building AI in a desperate attempt to cut costs. Without sufficient capital, big orgs will struggle to pay the hefty price for the newer Blackwell chips (which they won’t even be able to buy until the summer). As such NVIDA’s revenue will fall in the current environment and wall street knows this. That’s why they are pumping the stock while also buying short positions "

2 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I said they really have no peer in this space. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price.

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/

I was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE

I had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.

Bless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.

EDIT: I just think it’s way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  

Much like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it’s very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the “street” or “market” pivots quickly.  

5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  

https://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

When you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it’s almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won’t have large purchases.  No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter.  This business cycles and when it goes down it’ll go down for 2 years and rocket up after when people need to bulk order."

2024-05-01 16:21:22,rayrayrex,NVDA will drop to 800 tomorrow because:,"1. SMCI and AMD’s failure to perform will continue to bring the semiconductor market down tomorrow. The only reason why the burn was offset was due to Papa Powell giving the bulls a nice massage in the form of market calming. Every single serious question he was asked he deflected with “we gotta wait for the data”. The thing is people are catching on to this and the market is now pricing one or less rate cuts which will lead to a bearish week and decline going forward 

2. The supply chain constraints that SCMI and AMD attributed to their less than stellar results are the same issues that NVDA will have been facing when they report their results. Ergo they will miss either revenue, eps, or guidance going forward 

3. Aside from Apple earnings there are no more positive events coming up that can justify the hype carrying the stock

No one can ever catch up to nvidia. They have the most advanced chips, and because they’re already using AI to help them design next generation chips, no matter what, they will ALWAYS be massively ahead of the competition. 

They own the supply, so even if a competitor started to purchase nvidia Blackwell cluster, nvidia could just control the amount they sell to said competitor. The simple fact is this: they won and scaling laws say they will always win.

Just know these two facts: 

a) Cramer said everyone wants out of NVDA today

b) Cathie Woods doesn’t own NVDA 

There are people who’ve made fortunes simply inversing Cramer especially when it comes to plays on popular stocks. Cramer said he was short NVDA during September 2022 (will post video link to this in comments). On July 9, 2024, Cramer tweeted out “Nvidia about to break out from the churn post stock split?”. The same week NVDA went from 135 to 127 and has been going down since. It will now do the opposite and I’m expecting a major pump already tomorrow on Friday. 

As for Cathie, as everyone knows, she sold most of her NVDA holdings when it was below $15 per share post split. And yet somehow, she gets to manage billions.

1) There seems to be no end in sight with Jensen’s ability to juice earnings releases. Is it the leather jacket? No. Well we don’t know for sure, but the last six ERs have resulted in an average reaction of roughly +8.5%. Isn’t that what Buffet earns on an annual basis?


2) Look at the chart. I’m not usually one for technical analysis, but it’s quite clear reviewing the chart on my Apple iPhone’s stocks app that we’ve reached the bottom of this selloff. Image attached for your reference. 


3) The delay in Blackwell chip rollout is not a big deal if it’s even real. Jensen has been clear that demand for Hopper still exceeds supply. Someone did the math previously, but any impact of a 3 month delay is mitigated by the fact that they’ll simply sell more H200. Just Google “Blackwell delay” and you’ll see lots of articles on sites you’ve never heard of confirming the same.


4. Nancy Pelosi is still buying. She’s probably already seen the AGI locked in Sam’s basement. Don’t forget, this entire AI wave was kicked off by ChatGPT. That’s just the very tip of the AI iceberg that’s about to change the course of humanity’s future. Any upcoming product releases from the big players in this space are only going to reignite excitement for this technology and thusly shares of NVDA.

2024-08-25 12:21:27,chewbaccashotlast,NVDA | How to make money in options,"4 times a year the biggest announcement comes upon us and yes here it is again this week!

Needless to say the price action the next few weeks is going to ruin some of you and make others of you want to call nana.

How can you make money on options this week? Well, I’ve written you a helpful guide to do so.

Prior to Wednesday market close:
- puts $3-5 OTM 8/30 expiry until NVDA crosses $125 or lower
- $130 calls 8/30 expiry if NVDA falls below $125, then drop calls dollar for dollar (ex: if NVDA hits $122 buy $127 calls).
- swing trade the shit out of this and close out all these mofos prior to earnings.

Wednesday market close:
- stay the F out. This stock will move a bunch AH but it’ll open no more than 3% higher Thursday and IMO will trade 3-5% lower. I think the channel for this is tightening up to really shake some branches in both legs of the options chain.

Thursday Morning:
- let that IV deflate and enter a long call position. What I am uncertain about is how quickly it will recover n rally. I would not be the least bit surprised if you see some downside Thursday Friday.
- I will be watching closely and guess it will fall to below $110 very shortly after earnings. If it opens $125 or higher it may take 3 days for it otherwise I expect the downside to run its course by the weekend.
- calls $5-10 OTM for 9/13 expiration. Of course that’s LEAPS to yall here so fine go with 9/6 I just don’t know how long it will do nothing before the do something meme no longer applies.

TL/DR: Market makers will screw both sides of the options chain on earnings. Play puts leading up to ER if NVDA > $125 and calls if it falls below $125. Look for calls after ER timing Thursday might be tight wait until Friday go $5-10 OTM 2 weeks out.

You’re welcome 😘"

2024-08-27 17:52:35,AwarenessOk5979,Things to consider before betting it all on NVDA earnings tomorrow.,"**TLDR; I AM AS REGARDED as the next guy, but I recommend lowering exposure to NVDA earnings tomorrow to save money to play the aftermath.**

Tomorrow is the Super Bowl of stocks. It's no secret that everyone down to the shoe shiner is balls deep in NVDA (mostly long, looking at the options chain) exposure. There are also those hoping for the end of the world to begin tomorrow. But the one thing we know about Wall Street as a certainty is that they don't like when retail wins.

**We are all aware of the bull case. VERY simplified:**

1. Major tech companies have significantly increased CAPEX in Q2 and it doesn't take a genius to figure out where that money went.

2. Tech CEOs have been quoted as saying that underspending is more of an issue than overspending. *See* *also* Sam Altman (OpenAI) & Co. as being open supporters of the theory of effective accelerationism, which in a nutshell is the belief that the pursuit of general intelligence warrants all costs, natural and financial.

3. Nvidia is still founder led at this scale by Jensen Huang who is an amazing man and one of the greatest minds of our time. 

**The bear case is mostly about forward guidance, as pretty much everyone believes there will be an EPS beat. This is mostly macroeconomic and includes:**

1. Concerns about tech companies not being able to profit from AI spending, leading to winding down.

Rebuttal: We're not going to see this materialize this quarter. Tech has barely dipped their toes into seeing what value they can extract out of the newest line of hardware. It is simply too early to see. Even if you don't buy that, see previous point about under/overspending.

2. Blackwell delays 

Rebuttal: Priced in, much like the heat death of the universe itself. But really, who cares about this. Blackwell is still the only game in town.

3. US economy slowing, 800k jobs just ""lost"" while stocks are nearing ATH, election concerns, general stuff like that.

Rebuttal: No rebuttal. Completely legitimate to believe that a large correction is looming, if you're not kidding yourself. 

**So why not move all in tomorrow? 50/50 is better odds than what retail usually get anyways.**

You all know about IV crush, how NVDA is already priced to jump basically 10% after earnings, and all that. If you need to play options, please consider getting ones longer than August 30, which will be impacted the most. September 20 seems like a fair middle ground between ""fun"" leverage and having enough time to correct the ship should things go bad. 

You also all know that the world is watching these earnings the way we watch a groundhog come out of a hole to tell us if there are going to be six more weeks of winter or early spring. If you are patient enough to hold cash and simply wait to see the outcome, you WILL make money on placing a directionally good bet - with the benefit of being able to scoop up IV crushed options. It is also possible to hold SPY calls/puts as a proxy for NVDA to lessen the impact of IV crush.

It is a likely reality that big money is able to keep the prices pinned this week so that these 130's expire cheap or worthless. A massive 128.60 institutional buy wall was briefly up today, before the stint over 129, which suggests to me that smart money/funds are keeping dry powder ready. 

Please consider which would minimize regret: missing out on winning the big 50/50 or not having the funds to act on what will be very well informed plays for the direction of the entire market over the next 1-2 months.

Thank you very much, may God protect our savings."

There are 136k contracts open on 130 calls for 8/30 expiration. 80k open on 140 calls.

Nothing close on put side (30k at 125 put, 64k at 120 put).

They will not allow those calls to wind up ITM. Retail cannot be allowed to win at that scale.

Calling flat, all contracts IV crushed.

2024-09-05 08:29:39,No-Establishment8330,NVDA is a money destroying machine lately,"NVDA's stock price experienced significant declines following its earnings

Day 1: NVDA's stock price declined by 2% ahead of its earnings report, likely due to caution and uncertainty among investors.

Day 2: Despite reporting good earnings, NVDA's stock price dropped by 6.38%.

Day 3: The market rallied, with semi-conductor peers rising 5-10%, while NVDA's stock price increased by a modest 1.5%.

Day 4: NVDA's stock price plummeted by 9.5% due to fear and concerns surrounding the DOJ staff.

Day 5: NVDA's stock price experienced a ""rug pull"" from a 2% gain to a 2% decline.

Day 6: After the DOJ issue proved to be fake news, NVDA's stock price experienced another ""rug pull"" from a gain of over 3% to a flat performance.

Edit: it is going down more AH after AVGO ER"
2024-09-06 01:46:17,mollylovelyxx,People overreacting to NVDA’s drop are about to learn a hard lesson ,"This happens every damn time. The stock drops more than 10-20%, everyone loses their mind, people panic and call for absurdly low price targets like 70-80, and then it shoots back up. 

And **every** single time these predictions and targets pop up, they are said with the utmost confidence only for them to be wrong. 

It’s remarkable how people can’t follow the simple adage of buying during fear and selling during greed. This entire sub is panicking and frothing over how much the stock dropped and you’re now…selling? **after** the drop? A drop which was precipitated by a baseless article regarding a DOJ subpoena? No wonder you’re losing your grandma’s money.

Bought 168x NVDA 139p yesterday, nobody thought it was a good idea. Yep... Sold most of them between 8-9.

Also IBKR UI sucks! This screen looks so boring compared to Robinhood's.

2024-11-02 08:17:45,Kazgarth_,Why I think TSM/INTC will outpace NVDA/AMD growth in the next decade. ,"Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are spending billions of CapEx on AI. Lets just look at their last 2 quarters spending:

* **Amazon**: Increased CapEx from $60 billion in Q2 2024 to $70 billion in Q3 2024.
* **Google**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion in the same period.
* **Microsoft**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion.
* **Meta**: Increased CapEx from $29 billion to $31 billion.

However not all that CapEx is going to third party AI solutions like Nvidia/AMD. Each and every company listed above has or is developing it's own custom AI silicon.

Lets look how they are transitioning from 3rd party to In-House AI silicon:

**Amazon**: Developed AWS Inferentia and Tranium chips for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Google**: Developed Tensor Processing Unite (TPU) and Axion chip for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

**Microsoft**: Developed Azure Maia AI chip and Azure Cobalt for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Meta**: Developed Meta trading and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

All those developments reduce dependence on external GPU suppliers, allow more customized/efficient AI processing and most importantly huge cost savings.

Just to understand the level of savings (and why would they invest huge R&D budget on this):

A **regular Nvidia H100 GPU**, cost approximately **$3,320** to manufacture from TSMC. However it is being sold at **$25,000 to $30,000** each!

That's almost 800%-900% profit margins that has to be paid by the companies above, when they opt not to choose In-House Silicon.

As more of the AI CapEx goes to custom silicon (will never be 100%, but expect that percentage only to grow larger over time, driven by cost savings)  TSMC and Intel foundries will benefit directly from this trend (both have EUV capabilities, INTC will mass produce 18A EUV chips next year, with Amazon as first client)

And this will position TSMC and INTC for substantial growth, because **the rate limiting factor for AI growth will be how much silicon can TSMC or INTC manufacture** for the entire world's AI demand.

2024-11-04 06:21:19,Option_Closeout,Mega Bull is about to be unleashed,"The US equities market are about to experience a powerful surge in the coming weeks as the participants gets clarity on:

1) US election results (Nov 5): Kamala and Trump have very different ideas on managing economy, international trade , and foreign policy. The market is sitting on the fence (not commiting any more cash and rightly so) till the election results are out and investors know how a sector is likely to perform in next 12-24 months.

2) At least 25 basis rate cut by US Fed (Nov 7):  CPI report last week was benign enough to free US Fed for another rate cut of 25 basis points. US middle class, small businesses, and even investors are reeling under high interest rates. And another rate cut will bolster their confidence to invest and bring borrowing costs lower to spur consumption.

3) Nvidia earnings (Nov 20): Nvidia has been the bulwark of AI sector. Most fabulous amongst the fabulous 7. Its earnings results are likely to give another confirmation of high demand of AI chips (which will lead to higher productivity and efficency) and provide a strong boost Nasdaq returns by the end of the year.
